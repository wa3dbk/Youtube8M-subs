on<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.160> taste<00:02:43.220> really<00:02:43.640> does<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.330> is

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
on your taste really does and this is

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.850 
on your taste really does and this is
not<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.380> low-sodium<00:02:45.770> food<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.500> sure<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.650> can

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
not a low-sodium food and I sure you can

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.220 
not a low-sodium food and I sure you can
make<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.430> less<00:02:49.700> salt<00:02:50.090> probably<00:02:50.900> take

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
make it with less salt probably take

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.410 
make it with less salt probably take
longer<00:02:51.440> permit<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.250> would<00:02:52.400> think<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:52.880> I'm<00:02:53.120> sure

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
longer permit I would think but I'm sure

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.540 
longer permit I would think but I'm sure
their<00:02:53.630> recipes<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.350> there<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:55.370> overall

their recipes out there but overall

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.090 
their recipes out there but overall

dandy<00:04:02.120> krautrock<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:04.760> boiled<00:04:05.180> this<00:04:05.360> I

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
dandy krautrock I just boiled this I

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.560 
dandy krautrock I just boiled this I
clean<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.579> sterilized<00:04:08.180> and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
clean it so that it's sterilized and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.479 
clean it so that it's sterilized and
then<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.810> want<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> use<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.950> wait<00:04:10.160> down

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
then you want to use that to wait down

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.660 
then you want to use that to wait down
the<00:04:10.850> whole<00:04:11.030> business<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:13.250> going<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.519> keep

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
it ferments nicely and doesn't go bad

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.749

see after you check it you're going to
want<00:04:22.259> to<00:04:22.319> check<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> every<00:04:22.710> few<00:04:23.009> days<00:04:23.160> you're

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090

bubble<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.669> little<00:04:26.910> bit<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.300> start<00:04:27.509> fermenting

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
bubble a little bit to start fermenting

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.689

you're<00:04:28.470> going<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.889> scum<00:04:29.250> on<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.460> top

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
you're going to see a scum on the top

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.249 
you're going to see a scum on the top
don't<00:04:29.880> freak<00:04:30.180> out<00:04:30.330> that's<00:04:30.599> not<00:04:30.780> going<00:04:30.960> bad

that<00:04:31.680> means<00:04:31.860> it's<00:04:31.979> doing<00:04:32.250> its<00:04:32.400> job<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:32.880> you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
that means it's doing its job but you

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.659 
that means it's doing its job but you
want<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.210> spoon<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.569> scum<00:04:34.080> off<00:04:34.259> because<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
more you leave this come on that it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.439 
more you leave this come on that it
slows<00:04:37.710> down<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.190> fermentation<00:04:38.849> process<00:04:38.880> so

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
slows down the fermentation process so

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.820 
slows down the fermentation process so
you<00:04:39.509> want<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> spoon<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.020> out<00:04:40.380> every<00:04:40.620> couple

you want to spoon that out every couple
of<00:04:40.979> days<00:04:41.840> make<00:04:42.840> sure<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.110> your<00:04:45.110> cabbage<00:04:46.110> is

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
of days make sure that your cabbage is

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.610 
of days make sure that your cabbage is
still<00:04:46.470> staying<00:04:46.710> below<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.729> liquid<00:04:48.270> level<00:04:48.620> if

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
still staying below the liquid level if

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.560 
still staying below the liquid level if
you<00:04:49.889> need<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.610> can<00:04:50.639> add<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.000> little<00:04:51.240> bit<00:04:51.509> of

you need to you can add a little bit of

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.680 
you need to you can add a little bit of
saltwater<00:04:52.530> brine<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.430> just<00:04:53.580> mix<00:04:54.030> up<00:04:54.240> salt

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
saltwater brine to it just mix up salt

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.450 
saltwater brine to it just mix up salt
water<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.169> pour<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.470> onto<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.830> top<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.160> tea

water and pour it onto the top of tea

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.420 
water and pour it onto the top of tea
you<00:04:57.240> really<00:04:57.539> don't<00:04:57.720> need<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:57.990> do<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.430> that's

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
you really don't need to do that that's

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.029 
you really don't need to do that that's
only<00:04:59.639> your<00:05:00.150> losing<00:05:00.840> fluid<00:05:01.289> somehow<00:05:01.820> um<00:05:04.039> it

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
only your losing fluid somehow um it

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.620 
only your losing fluid somehow um it
should<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.550> create<00:05:05.940> all<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.210> its<00:05:06.509> own

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
should really create all of its own

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.490 
should really create all of its own
liquid<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:09.419> do<00:05:09.599> that<00:05:09.780> you<00:05:09.990> leave<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.289> for<00:05:10.470> a

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
liquid you do that you leave it for a

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.240 
liquid you do that you leave it for a
couple<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.830> weeks<00:05:11.150> in<00:05:12.150> about<00:05:12.800> average<00:05:13.800> 70

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
couple of weeks in about average 70

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.620 
couple of weeks in about average 70
degree<00:05:14.520> house<00:05:16.310> two<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.520> four<00:05:17.759> weeks<00:05:17.789> should

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
degree house two to four weeks should

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.659 
degree house two to four weeks should
probably<00:05:19.110> do<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.319> just<00:05:20.159> depending<00:05:20.490> on<00:05:20.550> your

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
probably do it just depending on your

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.820 
probably do it just depending on your
taste<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.150> longer<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.990> sits<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.440> stronger

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
taste the longer it sits the stronger

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.270 
taste the longer it sits the stronger
it's<00:05:22.979> going<00:05:23.159> to<00:05:23.220> get<00:05:23.750> so<00:05:24.979> really<00:05:25.979> after<00:05:26.099> about

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
it's going to get so really after about

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.189 
it's going to get so really after about
two<00:05:26.520> weeks<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.909> want<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.210> start<00:05:27.419> testing<00:05:28.080> it

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
two weeks you want to start testing it

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.890 
two weeks you want to start testing it
tasting<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.919> down<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.789> see<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.479> just<00:05:30.659> want<00:05:30.840> to

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.149 
tasting it down to see you just want to
make<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.110> do<00:05:31.229> your<00:05:31.320> taste<00:05:31.590> your<00:05:31.800> family's

taste whatever is agreeable to you the

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.640 
taste whatever is agreeable to you the
cooler<00:05:35.610> your<00:05:35.820> temperature<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:37.320> longer

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
cooler your temperature is the longer

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.110 
cooler your temperature is the longer
it's<00:05:37.770> going<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:37.949> take<00:05:38.009> to<00:05:38.280> ferment<00:05:38.669> but<00:05:39.000> it

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
it's going to take to ferment but it

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.360 
it's going to take to ferment but it
should<00:05:39.300> still<00:05:39.330> permit<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.860> know<00:05:40.949> it<00:05:41.070> to<00:05:41.190> take

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
should still permit you know it to take

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.249 
should still permit you know it to take
six<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.820> eight<00:05:41.909> weeks<00:05:41.940> just<00:05:42.599> it<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:42.930> really

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
six to eight weeks just it just really

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.999 
six to eight weeks just it just really
depends<00:05:43.969> but<00:05:44.969> it's<00:05:45.150> again<00:05:45.870> it's<00:05:46.009> extremely

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
depends but it's again it's extremely

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.860 
depends but it's again it's extremely

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
simple process when I found out how
