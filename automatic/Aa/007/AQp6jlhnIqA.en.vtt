00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.900
 never second division again 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.480
 it was a hard way 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.400
 they should benefit from the opening match in the dfb cup at third division Braunschweig 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.860
 EHC but ten Felser won 1 to 0, the foundation for the good start to the season 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.619
 Hewitt made the second league start for the lead 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.599
 against Greuther Fürth 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.539
 and Stalin's honda buggy but also got himself with a dare for one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
 great season 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.450
 First, the center-back decided the games 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180
 Poverty lives and Roth Meyer 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180
 For a long time led the club's scorers list 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.910
 only on Matchday 5 scorer Erik Jendrisek managed the first 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.910
 storm-gate at all 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.400
 The head-to-head race with FC St Pauli was decided by the FCK in Hamburg 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.240
 an impressive achievement in itself 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 Martin Amedick once more tower in the battle 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 and the heavy worker of the team Adam Nemec Skövde the FCK to victory 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.109
 downright stunning the team played in the dfb cup 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.590
 against the still undefeated in the Bundesliga Leverkusen 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 at least now football germany was clear 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 the potential for change is there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.400
 the SC Rinteln sets the table that was already felt first 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.770
 there is no customer at all 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 even more beautiful 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.250
 With this success in the back of the FCK was the best away team of the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.120
 league 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.330
 won four away games in a row 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 first Cottbus 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.090
 Diamond Munich 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 a playfully strong FCK squad 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 that had not existed for years 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 Marco short handwriting clearly recognizable 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.390
 also goalkeeper Tobias Sippel played a great season even though the best defense 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.309
 the league in the barely let something through 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.739
 after the victory at Union Berlin, the FCK took the league lead and gave it 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 no longer off 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.159
 RP also because they know that we had set up German striker 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.949
 then winter came 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.949
 and the league leaders paid apprenticeship 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:49.569
 in Augsburg beaten 1 to 4 but under value there was a lot of bad luck 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.289
 the river to the start of the second round with 0 3 undefeated chance 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:02:59.939
 then the fear came 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 that the team crashes again from the ascent ranks 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.449
 like the year before 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 a classic false start after a game so you do not score 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.989
 but whenever it came down to it, this team called off their potential 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.959
 In Aachen, the FCK laid the foundation stone for promotion with a 13 0 victory 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.200
 defeated his small crisis thanks to Sidney Sam 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 the best second division player scored three times 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.849
 then the time came that Markus Steinhöfer only 14 seconds after his 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.159
 Replacement on average with his 2 10 clock home game against St Pauli 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.129
 LAC et CE still sat 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.129
 the 13 0 on it 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.769
 against Cottbus turned Steinhöfer a corner to 1 2 0 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.159
 it remained the ball of FCK cleared all the big names in the second division 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.119
 the way 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.059
 showed those who originally wanted to ascend themselves how to do it 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.539
 1860 Munich or Armenian Bielefeld 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.539
 no one could take the FCK anymore 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.379
 Stefan Kuntz and Marco have just done what they did from the beginning 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:23.469
 But never really wanted to bring the FCK back where he 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.149
 belongs the first league
