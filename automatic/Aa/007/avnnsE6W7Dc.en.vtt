00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.249 

now<00:00:01.560> about<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.979> clean<00:00:02.190> these<00:00:02.340> windows

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
now about to clean these windows

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.840 
now about to clean these windows
probably<00:00:04.259> some<00:00:04.529> people<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.980> more<00:00:05.130> due<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
probably some people have more due to

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.750 
probably some people have more due to
other<00:00:06.029> videos<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.470> see<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:08.069> bad<00:00:08.370> they<00:00:08.580> were

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
other videos and see how bad they were

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.970 
other videos and see how bad they were
thought<00:00:09.120> that'd<00:00:09.420> take<00:00:09.719> forever<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.380> clean<00:00:10.559> but

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
thought that'd take forever to clean but

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
thought that'd take forever to clean but
not<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.610> bad<00:00:13.040> now<00:00:14.179> there<00:00:15.179> are<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.330> types<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
not that bad now there are two types of

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.660 
not that bad now there are two types of
scrapers<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> large<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.369> tend<00:00:17.640> not

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
scrapers is a large one which I tend not

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.410 
scrapers is a large one which I tend not
to<00:00:17.760> use<00:00:18.560> because<00:00:19.560> often<00:00:20.010> glass<00:00:20.760> has<00:00:21.090> got<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
to use because often glass has got a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560 
to use because often glass has got a
slight<00:00:21.810> wave<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.119> large<00:00:24.300> ones

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
slight wave in it and the large ones

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.679 
slight wave in it and the large ones
tend<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> miss<00:00:25.080> bits<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.760> just

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
tend to miss bits so just use it I just

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
tend to miss bits so just use it I just
use<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> smaller<00:00:28.349> one<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.609> two<00:00:29.760> ways

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
use a smaller one and there's two ways

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.979 
use a smaller one and there's two ways
of<00:00:30.060> doing<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:31.940> first<00:00:32.940> I'll<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.420> half<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of doing it first I'll do half of this

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.220 
of doing it first I'll do half of this
dry<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:34.920> half<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> wet<00:00:36.079> now<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
dry and then half of it wet now if you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
dry and then half of it wet now if you
ever<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.559> someone<00:00:37.920> coming<00:00:38.129> down<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.550> anything

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
ever see someone coming down on anything

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.790 
ever see someone coming down on anything
like<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
like that

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
like that
saying<00:00:40.800> oh<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> he<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.430> great<00:00:41.879> well

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
saying oh this is he is great well

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.190 
saying oh this is he is great well
that's<00:00:42.719> wrong

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that's wrong

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.910 
that's wrong
you'll<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.430> forever<00:00:45.530> easiest<00:00:46.530> way<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
you'll be there forever easiest way is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.240 
you'll be there forever easiest way is
to<00:00:47.039> follow<00:00:47.190> along<00:00:49.850> right<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.070> get

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to follow along right so you don't get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.500 
to follow along right so you don't get
the<00:00:53.309> whole<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> first<00:00:53.789> time<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.329> back

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the whole lot the first time go back

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:06.380 
the whole lot the first time go back
over<00:00:54.840> it<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.770> course<00:01:01.800> simply<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.240> these

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
over it and of course simply and these

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.460 
over it and of course simply and these
windows<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.960> quite<00:01:07.200> dusty<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> overspray

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
windows are quite dusty so the overspray

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:27.760 
windows are quite dusty so the overspray
is<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> stick<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.400> well<00:01:11.790> anyway

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:40.280 

so<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.280> fine<00:01:38.960> now<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.200> another

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so that bit is fine now there is another

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.910 
so that bit is fine now there is another
way<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> doing<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:42.440> what<00:01:43.440> I'll<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.800> I'll

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
way of doing it what I'll do is I'll

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.750 
way of doing it what I'll do is I'll
just<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.220> damp<00:01:44.490> cloth<00:01:49.340> if<00:01:50.340> you've<00:01:50.610> got

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
just get a damp cloth if you've got

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.600 
just get a damp cloth if you've got
acrylics<00:01:51.240> mainly<00:01:51.860> this<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.040> help<00:01:53.250> soft

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
acrylics mainly this will help soft

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:11.840 
acrylics mainly this will help soft
matte<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.120> little<00:01:54.240> bit<00:01:54.390> I<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:11.820> it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
matte just that little bit I just see it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:45.309 
matte just that little bit I just see it
tend<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> come<00:02:12.510> off<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:13.020> easier

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.100 

and<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.440> will<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.739> one<00:02:46.890> here's<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.099> rag<00:02:47.870> please

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:05.360 

in<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.230> case<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.829> some<00:02:54.530> paper

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.390 

you<00:03:06.370> know<00:03:06.520> with<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.790> most<00:03:07.090> clean<00:03:07.330> window<00:03:11.400> now

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
you know with the most clean window now

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.680 
you know with the most clean window now
I<00:03:12.430> don't<00:03:12.670> know<00:03:12.850> if<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.060> pick<00:03:13.240> it<00:03:13.300> up<00:03:13.450> here

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
I don't know if you can pick it up here

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.210 
I don't know if you can pick it up here
there<00:03:13.840> are<00:03:13.990> marks<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.510> they're<00:03:16.690> all<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
there are marks but they're all on the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.650 
there are marks but they're all on the
inside<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.490> see<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:25.090> doesn't<00:03:25.390> take<00:03:25.540> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
inside so you see it doesn't take that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.080 
inside so you see it doesn't take that
long<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:26.170> clean<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.950> hard<00:03:30.310> call

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
long to clean so it's a hard call

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.580 
long to clean so it's a hard call
whether<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.480> want<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.720> mask<00:03:31.900> them<00:03:32.140> up<00:03:32.230> first

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
whether you want to mask them up first

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.990 
whether you want to mask them up first
or<00:03:32.920> whether<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.310> want<00:03:33.460> to<00:03:33.550> just<00:03:33.670> clean<00:03:33.880> them

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
or whether you want to just clean them

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.790 
or whether you want to just clean them
off<00:03:34.150> after<00:03:35.220> entirely<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.460> you
