through that way the fog hits the dry
ice<00:02:36.560> immediately<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:37.519> now<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:38.239> toss<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.630> lid<00:02:38.810> on

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
ice immediately but now we toss a lid on

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.259 
ice immediately but now we toss a lid on
and<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.320> are<00:02:39.350> ready<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.820> dry<00:02:41.030> ice

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
sci-fi shots with this cooler the lid

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.220 
sci-fi shots with this cooler the lid
wasn't<00:02:49.850> super<00:02:50.090> great<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.660> was<00:02:50.780> leaking<00:02:51.110> out

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
wasn't super great so it was leaking out

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.660 
wasn't super great so it was leaking out
but<00:02:51.410> after<00:02:51.620> taping<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.980> up<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.250> worked<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.549> lot

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
but after taping it up it worked a lot

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.580 
but after taping it up it worked a lot
better<00:02:52.730> however<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.390> did<00:02:53.750> end<00:02:53.989> up<00:02:54.140> using<00:02:54.410> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
better however I did end up using a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.900 
better however I did end up using a
different<00:02:54.620> cooler<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.250> had<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> much<00:02:55.670> more

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
different cooler that had a much more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.240 
different cooler that had a much more
solid<00:02:56.540> lid<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.170> keep<00:02:57.200> clear<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.799> those<00:02:57.920> leaks

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
solid lid to keep clear of those leaks

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.949 
solid lid to keep clear of those leaks
and<00:02:58.579> now<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:58.880> can<00:02:59.090> fill<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.360> floor<00:02:59.630> with<00:02:59.930> a

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and now we can fill the floor with a

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.410 
and now we can fill the floor with a
nice<00:03:00.230> thick<00:03:00.260> layer<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:00.950> fog<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.850> absolutely

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
nice thick layer of fog just absolutely

nice thick layer of fog just absolutely
epic<00:03:02.870> looking<00:03:03.620> goodness<00:03:04.100> which<00:03:04.459> right<00:03:04.640> at<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
epic looking goodness which right at the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.160 
epic looking goodness which right at the
opening<00:03:05.120> here<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.570> see<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> fog<00:03:05.989> just

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
opening here you can see the fog just

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.960 
opening here you can see the fog just
spilling<00:03:06.680> out<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.070> can<00:03:07.190> even<00:03:07.340> use<00:03:07.550> close-up

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
spilling out you can even use close-up

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.460 
spilling out you can even use close-up
shots<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.390> set<00:03:08.540> up<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> green-screen<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.349> get

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
shots to set up a green-screen to get

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.160 
shots to set up a green-screen to get
some<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.830> atmospheric<00:03:10.040> type<00:03:10.790> as

some kind of atmospheric type as
that<00:03:11.290> even<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> way<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.160> moves<00:03:12.370> across<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
that even the way it moves across the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.820 
that even the way it moves across the
floor<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.300> just<00:03:13.510> epic<00:03:13.690> looks<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.440> something

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
floor is just epic looks like something

my<00:03:41.380> favorite<00:03:41.800> use<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> fog<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.550> just<00:03:42.760> filling<00:03:43.030> a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
my favorite use of fog is just filling a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.240 
my favorite use of fog is just filling a
room<00:03:43.660> with<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.350> little<00:03:44.709> bit<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.890> atmosphere

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
room with that little bit of atmosphere

the<00:03:45.790> problem<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.330> usually<00:03:46.510> get<00:03:46.900> smoke

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the problem that I usually get smoke

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.259 
the problem that I usually get smoke
alarms<00:03:47.890> once<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.220> start<00:03:48.430> pumping<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.030> fog

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
alarms once I start pumping in the fog

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.789 
alarms once I start pumping in the fog
it's<00:03:49.569> not<00:03:49.750> long<00:03:49.989> till<00:03:50.170> they're<00:03:50.350> screaming

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
it's not long till they're screaming

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.380 
it's not long till they're screaming
since<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.190> hot<00:03:51.430> fog<00:03:51.670> shoots<00:03:51.970> right<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.299> the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
since that hot fog shoots right to the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.910 
since that hot fog shoots right to the
ceiling<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.750> sets<00:03:52.959> them<00:03:53.080> off<00:03:53.200> but<00:03:53.470> an<00:03:53.590> awesome

happy<00:03:54.160> accident<00:03:54.670> from<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:54.940> test<00:03:55.299> was

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
happy accident from the test was

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.880 
happy accident from the test was
discovering<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.170> cooling<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.530> fog<00:03:56.709> first

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
discovering that cooling the fog first

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.590 
discovering that cooling the fog first
not<00:03:57.130> only<00:03:57.160> filled<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.610> room<00:03:57.819> better<00:03:58.180> once<00:03:58.480> it

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
not only filled the room better once it

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.360 
not only filled the room better once it
spread<00:03:58.870> out<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.410> also<00:03:59.590> hung<00:03:59.950> there<00:04:00.130> longer

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
spread out but it also hung there longer

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.460 
spread out but it also hung there longer
and<00:04:00.730> didn't<00:04:01.209> set<00:04:01.450> off<00:04:01.569> my<00:04:01.870> alarms<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and didn't set off my alarms in the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.800 
and didn't set off my alarms in the
house<00:04:02.680> which<00:04:03.069> is<00:04:03.280> downright<00:04:03.790> amazing<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.660> from

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
now on this is my trick to fill a

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.280 
now on this is my trick to fill a
location<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.299> nice<00:04:07.420> layer<00:04:07.660> haze<00:04:07.930> without

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
location with a nice layer haze without

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.990 
location with a nice layer haze without
worrying<00:04:08.590> about<00:04:08.709> those<00:04:09.040> annoying<00:04:09.430> beeping

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
worrying about those annoying beeping

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.120 
worrying about those annoying beeping
smoke<00:04:10.209> alarms<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.080> I<00:04:11.200> know<00:04:11.260> I'm<00:04:11.500> using<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.950> low

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
smoke alarms and I know I'm using a low

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.830 
smoke alarms and I know I'm using a low
to<00:04:12.190> mid<00:04:12.430> priced<00:04:12.730> fog<00:04:13.000> machine<00:04:13.360> but<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.569> could

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
to mid priced fog machine but you could

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.660 
to mid priced fog machine but you could
do<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.080> same<00:04:14.290> with<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.560> lower-cost<00:04:15.069> one<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.430> have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
do the same with a lower-cost one I have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.550 
do the same with a lower-cost one I have
a<00:04:15.700> much<00:04:15.970> smaller<00:04:16.180> fifty<00:04:16.750> dollar<00:04:16.930> fog<00:04:17.200> machine

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
a much smaller fifty dollar fog machine

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.710 
a much smaller fifty dollar fog machine
that<00:04:17.739> worked<00:04:17.979> well<00:04:18.250> not<00:04:18.760> as<00:04:18.880> much<00:04:19.030> fog<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.630> you

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that worked well not as much fog and you

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.659 
that worked well not as much fog and you
need<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.109> reheat<00:04:20.500> more<00:04:20.739> often<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.519> can

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
need to reheat more often but you can

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.610 
need to reheat more often but you can
still<00:04:21.940> get<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> solid<00:04:22.510> effect<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.350> could<00:04:23.470> also

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
still get a solid effect you could also

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.620 
still get a solid effect you could also
do<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.190> effect<00:04:24.520> with<00:04:24.729> just<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.030> cooler<00:04:25.270> filled

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
do this effect with just a cooler filled

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.150 
do this effect with just a cooler filled
with<00:04:25.780> regular<00:04:26.169> ice<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> found<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:26.979> this

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
with regular ice but I found that this

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.740 
with regular ice but I found that this
method<00:04:27.220> works<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.880> lot<00:04:28.000> better<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.539> now<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
method works a lot better but now a

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.659 
method works a lot better but now a
quick<00:04:29.260> break<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.680> then<00:04:29.979> we<00:04:30.039> talk<00:04:30.220> more<00:04:30.430> fog
