homebrew<00:00:02.970> gadget<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:03.990> what<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.319> have<00:00:04.500> today<00:00:04.680> is

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
homebrew gadget and what I have today is

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.240 
homebrew gadget and what I have today is
a<00:00:05.970> cool<00:00:06.299> little<00:00:06.450> pond<00:00:06.839> pump<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.010> reason

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
a cool little pond pump and the reason

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.080 
a cool little pond pump and the reason
we<00:00:08.340> like<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.120> because<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.260> can<00:00:10.410> use<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:11.090> as

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
we like this is because we can use it as

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.959 
we like this is because we can use it as
a<00:00:12.179> recirculate<00:00:12.990> or<00:00:13.110> pump<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:14.280> our<00:00:14.549> cooling

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
a recirculate or pump for our cooling

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.779 
a recirculate or pump for our cooling
water<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.100> cool<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
water and what we like to do is cool it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
water and what we like to do is cool it
down<00:00:17.970> maybe<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.650> 120<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:23.180> 102<00:00:24.180> mash<00:00:24.990> tun<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
down maybe to 120 or 102 mash tun and a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
down maybe to 120 or 102 mash tun and a
keg<00:00:25.890> filled<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.430> hot<00:00:26.609> soapy<00:00:27.150> water<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:28.019> know

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
keg filled with hot soapy water you know

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.300 
keg filled with hot soapy water you know
we<00:00:28.199> use<00:00:28.320> what's<00:00:28.529> coming<00:00:28.740> off<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> cooling

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
we use what's coming off the cooling

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.820 
we use what's coming off the cooling
coil<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.240> hot<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.900> warm<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.320> cleaning<00:00:31.560> water

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
coil it's hot to warm up cleaning water

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.400 
coil it's hot to warm up cleaning water
and<00:00:32.160> being<00:00:32.850> less<00:00:33.059> wasteful<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and being less wasteful and then when it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.530 
and being less wasteful and then when it
drops<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.980> about<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.550> hundred<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.180> could

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
drops down to about a hundred we could

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.250 
drops down to about a hundred we could
do<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> setup<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:37.950> take<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.260> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
do this setup where we take this and we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
do this setup where we take this and we
put<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> down<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> cooler<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.520> clean

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
put it down in the cooler or if we clean

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
put it down in the cooler or if we clean
the<00:00:41.850> mash<00:00:42.000> tun<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.570> already<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.620> could<00:00:43.770> use

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the mash tun out already we could use

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
the mash tun out already we could use
that<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.690> drop<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> pump<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that and drop the pump in there and what

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
that and drop the pump in there and what
you'll<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.980> I've<00:00:50.850> got

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you'll see is that I've put I've got

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
you'll see is that I've put I've got
some<00:00:51.360> random<00:00:51.480> fittings<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.440> give<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
some random fittings they give it the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
some random fittings they give it the
same<00:00:53.070> adapt<00:00:53.850> eventually<00:00:54.510> through<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> quick

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
same adapt eventually through the quick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.380 
same adapt eventually through the quick
disconnect<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> mid

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
disconnect we have this one it was a mid

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
disconnect we have this one it was a mid
range<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.780> Harbor<00:00:58.050> Freight<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.739> cheap

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
range at Harbor Freight was really cheap

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
range at Harbor Freight was really cheap
still<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.520> fifteen<00:00:59.910> or<00:00:59.940> twenty<00:01:00.239> bucks<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
still like fifteen or twenty bucks I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
still like fifteen or twenty bucks I
maybe<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.280> size<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
maybe would go one size up but this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.340 
maybe would go one size up but this
works<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.110> ice

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
works and what I can do is take my ice

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
works and what I can do is take my ice
blocks<00:01:07.760> which<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.030> used<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.390> camping

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
blocks which we also used for camping

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.850 
blocks which we also used for camping
and<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:09.990> kinds<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.409> things

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and all kinds of other things

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.520 
and all kinds of other things
make<00:01:11.460> sure<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> lids<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.060> closed<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.350> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
make sure the lids are closed and I just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
make sure the lids are closed and I just
toss<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.890> down<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.490> sort<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> out

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
toss them down in there sort of out

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
toss them down in there sort of out
water<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.590> sorry<00:01:17.040> behind

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
water right down in there sorry behind

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.880 
water right down in there sorry behind
this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> water's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this is that you know when the water's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
this is that you know when the water's
coming<00:01:20.040> off<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> tap<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:21.030> getting<00:01:21.270> water

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
coming off the tap you're getting water

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.620 
coming off the tap you're getting water
maybe<00:01:21.630> 60<00:01:22.080> degrees<00:01:22.820> maybe<00:01:23.820> 70<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.450> hot

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
maybe 60 degrees maybe 70 if it's hot

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.310 
maybe 60 degrees maybe 70 if it's hot
maybe<00:01:25.140> less<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.619> cold<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
maybe less if it's cold but that's a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
maybe less if it's cold but that's a
pretty<00:01:28.470> big<00:01:28.590> gradient<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.360> you're

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
pretty big gradient but then when you're

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
pretty big gradient but then when you're
getting<00:01:30.750> closer<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> closer<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> 70

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
getting closer and closer you get to 70

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.210 
getting closer and closer you get to 70
if<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.790> water<00:01:32.909> 70<00:01:33.570> eventually<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.470> run<00:01:35.070> out

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
if your water 70 eventually just run out

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
if your water 70 eventually just run out
and<00:01:35.369> some<00:01:35.549> people<00:01:35.579> who<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.970> hot<00:01:36.560> climates

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and some people who have hot climates

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.080 
and some people who have hot climates
can't<00:01:37.829> even<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> way<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.000> where

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
can't even get all the way down to where

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
can't even get all the way down to where
they<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.560> could<00:01:40.770> work<00:01:40.860> thing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
they want to so this could work thing

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
they want to so this could work thing
for<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.369> too<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.299> essentially<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
for that too but essentially you just

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.340 
for that too but essentially you just
keep<00:01:43.979> stirring<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.579> time<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.909> time<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
keep stirring from time to time and the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.859 
keep stirring from time to time and the
ice<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> help<00:01:47.250> us<00:01:47.399> cool<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
ice is going to help us cool down the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
ice is going to help us cool down the
warm<00:01:49.140> effluent<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.460> worry<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.729> our

a<00:02:42.220> little<00:02:42.460> bit<00:02:42.610> faster<00:02:43.090> pumping<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.590> can

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
a little bit faster pumping but you can

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.650 
a little bit faster pumping but you can
get<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.160> last<00:02:45.400> sixty<00:02:45.820> degrees<00:02:46.090> or<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.450> down

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
get that last sixty degrees or so down
