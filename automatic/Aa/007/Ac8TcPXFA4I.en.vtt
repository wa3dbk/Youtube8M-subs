mean the nether room could it be the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
mean the nether room could it be the
other<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> life<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.090> another

realm who knows as of right now this is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
realm who knows as of right now this is
all<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.299> pure<00:01:09.570> speculation<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.950> I'm

all just pure speculation but what I'm

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
all just pure speculation but what I'm
most<00:01:11.189> likely<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.880> Kung<00:01:12.330> Lao<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> talking

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
most likely think Kung Lao is talking

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
most likely think Kung Lao is talking
about<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.130> nether<00:01:14.369> room<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> other

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
about is the nether room or the other

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
about is the nether room or the other
side<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> life<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.229> death<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.220> Kung

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
know this fact but anyways guys this is

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.990 
know this fact but anyways guys this is
my<00:04:40.410> whole<00:04:40.680> take<00:04:40.860> on<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.130> intro<00:04:41.400> dialogue<00:04:41.790> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
my whole take on the intro dialogue that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.730 
my whole take on the intro dialogue that
we<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.389> we<00:04:42.810> don't<00:04:42.930> know<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> intro

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
we have we don't know what the intro

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.800 
we have we don't know what the intro
dialogue<00:04:44.130> exactly<00:04:44.880> means<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:45.540> what<00:04:45.690> I'm

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
dialogue exactly means but what I'm

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.020 
dialogue exactly means but what I'm
thinking<00:04:46.229> once<00:04:46.440> again<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:47.040> that<00:04:47.280> noob<00:04:47.520> saibot

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
thinking once again is that noob saibot

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.670 
thinking once again is that noob saibot
is<00:04:48.150> calling<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.660> quietly<00:04:48.960> hang<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.410> he<00:04:49.530> can

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
is calling to quietly hang so he can

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.830 
is calling to quietly hang so he can
kill<00:04:49.919> them<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.310> so<00:04:50.669> he<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> revenant

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
kill them and so he can be a revenant

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.260 
kill them and so he can be a revenant
again<00:04:52.229> so<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.680> can<00:04:52.710> be<00:04:52.979> allies<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.699> so<00:04:54.030> both

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
again so they can be allies and so both

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.030 
again so they can be allies and so both
of<00:04:54.300> them<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.630> reside<00:04:55.139> with<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.590> nether<00:04:55.800> room

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
of them can reside with the nether room

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.500 
of them can reside with the nether room
but<00:04:56.310> anyways<00:04:56.639> let<00:04:56.970> me<00:04:57.000> know<00:04:57.090> what<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.389> guys
