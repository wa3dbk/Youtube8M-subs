00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.240
 good kids how are you doing today we have 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.130
 a pretty brief look at the new mode 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.450
 harlem game has revealed ign 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.460
 in a video that they published yesterday that 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.780
 although I would like very much to put background 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.940
 I can not do it for obvious reasons 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.440
 as usual I will let this video the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.150
 description that of course will come to you 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.890
 well have seen it before continuing 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.960
 this what it has been found out 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.730
 more than that I will also leave you another 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.230
 link to the page for my best 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.029
 news debate the Spanish film that you 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.560
 You can cross team players from 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.999
 then I recommend visiting if you do not 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.470
 it is clear some sure point that 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.419
 they have a good summary as usual 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.309
 but good let's go straight to the bases 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.690
 in this new way that we started with two 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.219
 sides evidently policemen and 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.289
 criminals the main objective of 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.969
 Game mode depends on how normal it is 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.590
 side on which we are since this mode 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.359
 will be of the style of protecting the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.129
 beat and since we talk about this one in the 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.050
 ign video is said to be the video to which 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.820
 the police protects is a sneak that is 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.070
 a deserter who evidently 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660
 criminals will want to eliminate each team 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.010
 It will consist of five members and 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.629
 the game will last a maximum of three 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.039
 minutes during which the objective 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.749
 of the beat will be to reach one of the two 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.940
 areas of the quotes between collected 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.530
 while the beep is busy in that the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.150
 The rest of the police must protect him 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.960
 that the real goal of criminals 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.460
 it is not 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.409
 to all the police but to the defector 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 so if this one dies the round is over 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.890
 on the contrary if all the criminals 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.450
 they are eliminated the round ends too 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.300
 but this time with the cops as 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.040
 victors and the truth is that I think 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.509
 something evident because of balance 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.100
 but just in case I should specify that 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.840
 there will be no vehicles in this mode which 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.369
 it seems good to me since it is logical 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.020
 basically that there are no vehicles when 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 there are so few players and the map is so 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.649
 reduced as the one shown to us 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.210
 another particularity that has been 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.860
 notice and what we should keep in mind is 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 apparently the bid will have 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.399
 a very limited arsenal that seems to be 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.320
 composed of the pistols of each class 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.729
 so I guess the class more 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 used will be that of engineer given the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.210
 revolvers available or enforcer 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.009
 since it has the eagle in particular 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.750
 the latter since we have seen it in 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.880
 functioning in the video and it seems that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.470
 is going to tighten quite said this me 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.330
 would like to give you my opinion on the subject 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.710
 and it's good that this is something that always 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.940
 you told me but lately he has 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.440
 there was an increase in the people that I 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.690
 says that if he had thought about trying the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.979
 competitive as you'll know I'll never 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.479
 I was very involved in that subject 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.670
 mainly because I do not have even the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.039
 skill or the between quotes clarity 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.390
 necessary mentally and if I am sincere do not 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.369
 has called too much attention to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.110
 less in battlefield 4 in a game in the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.240
 that the competitive levels again 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.000
 important meals has fallen quite 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.380
 hard though and this may be 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.130
 influenced by my desire to leave 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.510
 hard line 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 this video has left me with enough 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320
 hype since although they have always said that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.820
 would focus on the competitive this time 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.440
 has seen a clear effort on the part of 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 visceral for focusing on this and also 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.650
 with a much more original proposal 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.720
 that the one that gave us dais with 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.150
 deactivation in battlefield 4 that already 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 you know how that mode has ended 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.690
 I want to get there is what this will be 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.040
 resurface or rather the awakening of the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.320
 saga battlefield the competitive to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.330
 considerable levels on my part that 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.830
 I hope so and who knows not in time 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.420
 complete since that space occupies 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.620
 youtube but I see quite possible 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.050
 spend much more time in the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.489
 competitive with this new delivery and 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.720
 good kids that would be all for the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.820
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.230
 although it is brief as always 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.060
 we have a news it is important to me 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 I would like to have your opinion 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.720
 the visceral proposal to introduce 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.550
 the competitive one in Harlem and if it fits more 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 important you see yourself playing the long 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.880
 deadline I hope to see everything in comments 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.300
 so saying nothing, I say goodbye goodbye 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.300
 kids
