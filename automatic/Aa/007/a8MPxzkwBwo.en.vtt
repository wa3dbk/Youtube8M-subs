flappy birds then you learned a lot of
the<00:00:14.969> basics<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.570> game<00:00:16.260> design<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.460> this

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the basics of game design so in this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.250 
the basics of game design so in this
tutorial<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> expand<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.230> that

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
tutorial we're going to expand on that

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529 
tutorial we're going to expand on that
and<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.369> focusing<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and really be focusing on some of the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.840 
and really be focusing on some of the
things<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.869> libgdx<00:00:22.230> actually<00:00:23.010> exposes<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
things that libgdx actually exposes to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
things that libgdx actually exposes to
us<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:24.900> our<00:00:25.109> game<00:00:25.289> design<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:26.099> bit

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
us to make our game design a little bit

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
us to make our game design a little bit
easier<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.779> series<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
easier so in this series we're going to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
easier so in this series we're going to
be<00:00:28.410> talking<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:29.010> game<00:00:29.789> screens<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
be talking about game screens in the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
be talking about game screens in the
game<00:00:31.199> class<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> be

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
game class we're also going to be

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
game class we're also going to be
talking<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.120> sprite<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> sprite<00:00:34.230> sheet

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
talking about sprite and sprite sheet

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
talking about sprite and sprite sheet
classes<00:00:35.570> new<00:00:36.570> ways<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.200> animation<00:00:38.600> texture

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
classes new ways to do animation texture

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.650 
classes new ways to do animation texture
maps<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.260> create<00:00:40.530> our<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.890> worlds<00:00:41.579> new<00:00:42.450> ways

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
maps to create our game worlds new ways

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.420 
maps to create our game worlds new ways
to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> collision<00:00:43.559> detection<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.160> we're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to do collision detection because we're

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
to do collision detection because we're
also<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.969> colliding<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.570> enemies

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
also going to be colliding with enemies

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
also going to be colliding with enemies
and<00:00:46.350> different<00:00:47.280> kinds<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> blocks<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> stuff

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and different kinds of blocks and stuff

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
and different kinds of blocks and stuff
like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> huge<00:00:49.379> game<00:00:49.649> world<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like that on a huge game world so we

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
like that on a huge game world so we
don't<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> check<00:00:51.600> every<00:00:52.170> object<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
don't want to check every object in the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
don't want to check every object in the
game<00:00:53.129> world<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.820> collision<00:00:54.360> we're<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
game world for collision we're going to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.760 
game world for collision we're going to
be<00:00:55.530> talking<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:57.239> variety<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.559> other

of my flappy bird tutorial and that will
pretty<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.590> explain<00:01:29.100> everything<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.880> I'm

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
pretty much explain everything that I'm

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
pretty much explain everything that I'm
kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> rushing<00:01:30.900> through<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.650> more

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
kind of rushing through here in more

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.350 
kind of rushing through here in more
depth<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.729> first<00:01:32.939> thing<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
depth so the first thing we're going to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
depth so the first thing we're going to
do<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.900> ahead<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> download<00:01:34.590> libgdx<00:01:38.450> okay

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
do is go ahead and download libgdx okay

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
do is go ahead and download libgdx okay
so<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:39.960> open<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> file<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.310> you'll<00:01:41.490> have

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so now open up that file and you'll have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
so now open up that file and you'll have
the<00:01:41.790> project<00:01:42.000> set<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.750> we're<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.079> to
