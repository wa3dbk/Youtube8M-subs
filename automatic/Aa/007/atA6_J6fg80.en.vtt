00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:18.840
 I have to go back to fitness 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.000
 friends today it's about wanting fans i 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.949
 the products are currently testing bz what 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 I have already tested myself and myself 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.000
 have the following things to order you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 the dressing hanni barbecue sauce 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 chocolate chocolates xerox europe 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 but also called syrup in German 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.079
 and apple cinnamon al aziz without apple 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.030
 Jam something like that in my own way 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.000
 I ordered the things why 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 So who in the building phase 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 is more calories to yourself 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 can take for those who do it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.980
 no sense that only make people for 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.559
 People who are in a diet are the ones 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 to save calories or for people 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.879
 who do not take so much sugar 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 want because the products have no 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.650
 sugar or for people who are not too much 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.720
 take bold to be so because you want 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.130
 For example , it knows this now 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.890
 dressing when I put it on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 was in reality because it was already 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 So say the right thing is that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 dressing has a lot of fat and that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.460
 no one here so it for people the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 want to save fat want to save sugar 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.009
 or generally in the diet and and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.240
 calories I can feed 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.590
 I'll never say that either 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 that's how good we taste the right ones 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 So if you have the right product 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.079
 Taste frick then it will be you 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.579
 neither 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 I tried everything and yes me 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.329
 start with the sweet assortment 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.820
 directly from animals the video seen 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.130
 I have my pancakes with this 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 I can eat pancakes syrup 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.790
 very recommended 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.360
 that does not taste that artificially 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 tastes sweet as yes comes already 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 maple syrup very close and sweet to the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 it is already sweet 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.039
 optimal 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.979
 we have the apple excavator with cinnamon here 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.989
 Flavor this also really cool too 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.090
 In addition, penke is eaten or on the bread 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.709
 which always calorie-free, of course 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.370
 I also highly recommend the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.599
 chocolate sauce I have to say oh 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.299
 By the way I have the products 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.140
 The best recession you can buy 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.430
 I had this here at amazon 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.709
 do not recommend at all 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.560
 that tastes artificially through that 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.810
 is chocolate but it is so 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.860
 artificially liquid and artificial 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.989
 can not understand if someone 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 but it can be recommended that you 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.239
 but it says I hate it then 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.099
 I here the today's assortment too 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.280
 the two best rated best 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.370
 products the barbecue sauce goes through 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.220
 So I tried my steak 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.230
 and to munich and that goes through but 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.989
 Tastes and smells also in the tic 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.720
 artificially is also clear if it is for 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.280
 calorie has no calories then though 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200
 they will always be natural 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.299
 somehow had to be a bit 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.370
 chemistry in it 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.319
 This tracing can I recommend 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.079
 I tasted my salad eaten 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.120
 can you imagine like that 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.560
 I eat it so I like it too 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.700
 that with a bit of course still 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.669
 other flavors 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.530
 I order active themselves often have 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.090
 I make most of the things I 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.579
 also in the description have 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.470
 if i promise i will just do that in 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.410
 the description of what I use myself 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.650
 or have used and really cool 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.599
 for example, of those yes I will 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.430
 do not use everything now so bring 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.000
 you and not all that is that 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.200
 worst thing is that in the one 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.109
 clusions ago 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.810
 this is the best then comes the that 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.090
 that and the sauce the chocolate sauce is that 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.250
 worst 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.579
 and I will write to you in the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.500
 at least the two three things a lot two 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.450
 three four things that I find cool 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.819
 chocolate sauce is definitely not 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.950
 in because I have the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.189
 i can puke ok i hope i could 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.189
