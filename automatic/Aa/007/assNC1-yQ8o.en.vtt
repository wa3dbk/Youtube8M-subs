like<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.880> card<00:01:15.210> quite<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> bit<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.409> actually

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
like this card quite a bit but actually

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.850 
like this card quite a bit but actually
my<00:01:16.920> favorite<00:01:17.610> card<00:01:17.970> overall<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
my favorite card overall out of all the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.399 
my favorite card overall out of all the
cards<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> primal<00:01:21.030> clash<00:01:21.180> set<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:22.380> be

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
cards in the primal clash set would be

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
cards in the primal clash set would be
this<00:01:22.710> last<00:01:23.040> card<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.850> purchased<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.689> love

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
this last card which I purchased to love

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.160 
this last card which I purchased to love
and<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.979> primal<00:01:26.729> Kyogre<00:01:27.210> reacts<00:01:27.689> full

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and that is primal Kyogre reacts full

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.410 
and that is primal Kyogre reacts full
art<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.850> price<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
art this one was the same price as the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
art this one was the same price as the
Groudon<00:01:31.909> 1995<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.360> purchased<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
Groudon 1995 I purchased two of these I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
Groudon 1995 I purchased two of these I
actually<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.180> most

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
actually think this will be the most

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.460 
actually think this will be the most
valuable<00:01:37.200> card<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> future<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
valuable card in the future in the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.609 
valuable card in the future in the
primal<00:01:40.950> clash<00:01:41.070> set<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
primal clash set so there's one and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
primal clash set so there's one and
there<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.280> other<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> summarize

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
there is the other so just to summarize

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
there is the other so just to summarize
for<00:01:46.560> ex<00:01:47.570> full<00:01:48.570> art<00:01:48.600> cards<00:01:49.320> mega<00:01:49.950> X<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
for ex full art cards mega X that is and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.530 
for ex full art cards mega X that is and
all<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.649> around<00:01:52.799> 20<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> 23<00:01:53.939> dollars<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
all are right around 20 to 23 dollars a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.280 
all are right around 20 to 23 dollars a
piece

so<00:01:55.590> here's<00:01:55.770> both<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.340> primal<00:01:56.700> Kyogre<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
so here's both the primal Kyogre like I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.530 
so here's both the primal Kyogre like I
said<00:01:58.049> I'll<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.500> several<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.219> bought<00:02:00.180> cards

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
said I'll have several more bought cards
