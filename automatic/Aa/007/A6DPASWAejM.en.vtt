hey dr. G here with natural foods diet

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey dr. G here with natural foods diet
Lord<00:00:02.939> didn't<00:00:03.720> want<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:03.990> tell<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.350> about<00:00:04.440> one

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
Lord didn't want to tell you about one

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.860 
Lord didn't want to tell you about one
of<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.980> best<00:00:05.520> things<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.060> know<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.420> improve

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
of the best things I know to improve

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.560 
of the best things I know to improve
your<00:00:07.290> health<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.820> get<00:00:09.059> some

your health and that is to get some
living<00:00:09.929> water<00:00:11.150> now<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.509> treat<00:00:13.139> patients

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
living water now when I treat patients

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670 
living water now when I treat patients
either<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:15.299> preventive<00:00:15.960> medicine<00:00:16.379> or

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
either with preventive medicine or

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.470 
either with preventive medicine or
treatment<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.400> medical<00:00:17.789> conditions<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.449> of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
treatment for medical conditions one of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.330 
treatment for medical conditions one of
the<00:00:18.660> things<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.170> highly<00:00:19.590> recommend<00:00:19.619> is

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the things that I highly recommend is

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730 
the things that I highly recommend is
that<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> source<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> call

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that they get a source of what I call

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.029 
that they get a source of what I call
living<00:00:23.670> water<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.269> living<00:00:25.080> water<00:00:25.230> means<00:00:25.680> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
living water and living water means that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.689 
living water and living water means that
the<00:00:26.279> water<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:26.970> gone<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.109> natural

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
the water has gone through the natural

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.049 
the water has gone through the natural
hydrologic<00:00:29.699> cycle<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.619> opposed<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.759> tap<00:00:32.759> water

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
hydrologic cycle as opposed to tap water

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.330 
hydrologic cycle as opposed to tap water
now<00:00:33.270> think<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> tap<00:00:34.020> water<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
now think of the tap water we know it's

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.190 
now think of the tap water we know it's
full<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.700> chemicals<00:00:36.500> they<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.530> chlorine<00:00:38.190> some

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
full of chemicals they use chlorine some

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
full of chemicals they use chlorine some
communities<00:00:40.200> fluoridate<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> water<00:00:41.280> both<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
communities fluoridate the water both of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
communities fluoridate the water both of
which<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.570> toxic

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
which are toxic

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.889 
which are toxic
then<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> pipes<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> water<00:00:45.570> goes

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
then the pipes that the water goes

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
then the pipes that the water goes
through<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.980> toxic<00:00:47.219> toxic<00:00:47.700> metals

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
through can also be toxic toxic metals

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.709 
through can also be toxic toxic metals
and<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> water<00:00:50.039> processing<00:00:50.789> itself<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.539> add

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and the water processing itself can add

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
and the water processing itself can add
aluminum<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.559> other<00:00:53.280> toxic<00:00:53.879> metals<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
aluminum and other toxic metals and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
aluminum and other toxic metals and
toxic<00:00:54.809> compounds<00:00:55.379> recent<00:00:55.829> studies<00:00:56.190> have

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
toxic compounds recent studies have

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.510 
toxic compounds recent studies have
shown<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.030> most<00:00:57.870> community<00:00:58.710> water<00:00:59.010> supplies

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
shown that most community water supplies

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080 
shown that most community water supplies
contain<00:01:00.120> drugs<00:01:00.829> many<00:01:01.829> drugs<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> most

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
contain drugs many drugs and most

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.469 
contain drugs many drugs and most
contain<00:01:03.780> hormones<00:01:04.430> now<00:01:05.489> hormones<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.270> think

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
contain hormones now hormones I think

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
contain hormones now hormones I think
are<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.110> long<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.500> they're<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.100> own

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
are good as long as they're your own

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
are good as long as they're your own
hormones<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.360> don't<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.720> some<00:01:10.439> extra

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hormones you don't want some extra

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.420 
hormones you don't want some extra
hormones<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.689> water<00:01:12.900> supply<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:14.280> if

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
hormones from your water supply now if

hormones from your water supply now if
we<00:01:14.580> think<00:01:14.760> about<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> hydrologic<00:01:15.869> cycle

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
we think about the hydrologic cycle

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
we think about the hydrologic cycle
think<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.340> how<00:01:17.520> complex<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.930> rain

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
think of how complex this is here rain

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.840 
think of how complex this is here rain

through the soil it percolates through

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.300 
through the soil it percolates through
the<00:01:26.820> rocks<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.600> minerals<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.890> gets<00:01:29.100> down

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the rocks and minerals and it gets down

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
the rocks and minerals and it gets down
into<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> aquifer<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.770> sit

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
into the aquifer and then it can sit

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
into the aquifer and then it can sit
there<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.990> years<00:01:33.990> sometimes<00:01:35.180> hundreds

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
sometimes thousands of years and then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
sometimes thousands of years and then
through<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.229> process<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> where<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.659> water

through a process of where the water

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.429 
through a process of where the water
flows<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:44.189> path<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.030> least<00:01:45.240> resistance<00:01:45.439> it

to the ocean or evaporates to complete
the<00:01:52.439> cycle<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:54.030> how

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the cycle now if we think about how

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
the cycle now if we think about how
complex<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.530> cycle<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.990> how<00:01:58.070> important

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
complex the cycle is and how important

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
complex the cycle is and how important
any<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> steps<00:02:00.270> might<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> mean<00:02:00.930> think

any of the steps might be I mean think

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.580 
any of the steps might be I mean think
of<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
there's theories that if you drink local

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.190 
there's theories that if you drink local

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
water with local antigens it improves

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.110 
water with local antigens it improves
your<00:02:25.380> immune<00:02:25.500> system<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.370> ability<00:02:26.880> to

further contaminate the water now the

important is that you don't want to be

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.979 
important is that you don't want to be
drinking<00:03:29.220> tap<00:03:29.549> water<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:30.180> don't<00:03:30.420> want<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.900> be

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
step if you can't get spring water you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.940 
step if you can't get spring water you
can<00:03:44.820> buy<00:03:45.030> spring<00:03:45.360> water<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.739> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
can buy spring water you can go to a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.190 
can buy spring water you can go to a
spring<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.730> do<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.150> advantages<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.959> going

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
spring like I do the advantages of going

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.920 
spring like I do the advantages of going
to<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> spring<00:03:50.070> are<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.630> out<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
to a spring are that you get out of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.039 
to a spring are that you get out of
nature<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.829> connect<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.450> ground<00:03:54.780> you

connect with the environment I get some

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.729 
connect with the environment I get some
exercise<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:59.100> carry<00:03:59.489> this<00:03:59.640> five<00:04:00.420> gallon<00:04:00.870> jug<00:04:01.440> of

the spring now the other advantage of
spring<00:04:31.130> water<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.670> it<00:04:31.940> usually<00:04:32.510> doesn't<00:04:32.720> have

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
spring water is it usually doesn't have

spring water is it usually doesn't have
any<00:04:33.610> pathogens<00:04:34.610> whereas<00:04:35.180> if<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.510> drink<00:04:36.040> water

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
any pathogens whereas if you drink water
