is it's a very small pistol kind of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.880 
is it's a very small pistol kind of
reminds<00:00:27.210> me<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.080> fire<00:00:28.439> strike<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.460> size<00:00:30.890> so

on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> bottom<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:46.049> also<00:01:46.170> does<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.130> any

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
on the bottom it also does not have any

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
on the bottom it also does not have any
sling<00:01:47.729> adaptors<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.479> mostly<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
sling adaptors that is mostly because it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.510 
sling adaptors that is mostly because it
comes<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> holster<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.399> just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

keep it on your side so now for the
functioning<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.250> gun<00:01:53.430> basically<00:01:54.000> how<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
functioning of this gun basically how it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
functioning of this gun basically how it
works<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.320> prime<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> gun<00:01:56.250> by<00:01:56.460> cocking<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
works you prime the gun by cocking it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
works you prime the gun by cocking it
back<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> let<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> forwards<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.619> does<00:01:58.799> have

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
back and let it forwards it does have

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
back and let it forwards it does have
the<00:01:59.100> part<00:01:59.310> where<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.790> let<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the part where when you let it go on the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
the part where when you let it go on the
back<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:02.070> slides<00:02:02.310> forward

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
back it kind of slides forward

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
back it kind of slides forward
automatically<00:02:03.090> put<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> dart<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
automatically put the dart in and you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.670 
automatically put the dart in and you
pull<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> trigger<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> dart<00:02:07.560> in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
pull the trigger you can put the dart in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.199 
pull the trigger you can put the dart in
first<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.280> prime<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> works<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> same

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
first and then prime it works the same

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.090 
first and then prime it works the same
way<00:02:09.739> no<00:02:10.739> difference

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
way no difference

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.650 
way no difference
one<00:02:12.190> thing<00:02:12.370> about<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.910> gun<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.450> with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
one thing about this gun is it with

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
one thing about this gun is it with
priming<00:02:13.960> when<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.350> prime<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.160> backwards<00:02:15.550> it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
priming when you prime it backwards it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.060 
priming when you prime it backwards it
seems<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:17.020> be<00:02:17.050> oiled<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.710> something

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
seems to like not be oiled or something

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.400 
seems to like not be oiled or something
because<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.820> seems<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> little<00:02:20.230> bit

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
because it seems to be a little bit

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.590 
because it seems to be a little bit
harder<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.830> prime<00:02:21.220> than<00:02:21.490> most<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> other

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
harder to prime than most of the other

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.530 
harder to prime than most of the other
guns<00:02:22.840> are<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.820> pros<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.240> cons<00:02:25.390> of

guns are now if the pros and cons of
this<00:02:25.630> gun<00:02:25.810> first<00:02:26.290> off<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.590> pros<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.910> gun<00:02:28.120> has

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
this gun first off the pros this gun has

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.910 
this gun first off the pros this gun has
a<00:02:28.330> really<00:02:28.750> nice<00:02:28.870> holster<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.560> first<00:02:29.770> gun

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920

a little quick-draw battle you can do
you<00:02:39.010> could<00:02:39.160> pull<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.670> fast<00:02:39.940> with

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
you could pull it out really fast with

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.760 
you could pull it out really fast with
the<00:02:40.270> holster<00:02:40.570> qu<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.870> really<00:02:41.200> easy<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.410> slide

the holster qu it's really easy to slide
out<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.610> also<00:02:42.760> has<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> lot<00:02:43.390> more<00:02:43.420> ammo<00:02:43.720> than<00:02:44.020> it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
cons of this gun it's kind of hard to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900 
cons of this gun it's kind of hard to
prime<00:02:56.020> compared<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> some<00:02:56.860> guns<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.310> mean<00:02:57.490> it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
prime compared to some guns I mean it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.330 
prime compared to some guns I mean it's
not<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> big<00:02:58.390> difference<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.190> little

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
not a big difference but it's a little

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.520 
not a big difference but it's a little
bit<00:03:00.460> more<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.260> feels<00:03:02.410> like

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
bit more it just really feels like

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.900 
bit more it just really feels like
you're<00:03:02.680> restricted<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.370> doesn't<00:03:03.670> allow

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
you're restricted and it doesn't allow

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.240 
you're restricted and it doesn't allow
you<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.120> pull<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.480> back<00:03:04.600> very<00:03:04.900> easy<00:03:05.250> another

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you to pull it back very easy another

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.710 
you to pull it back very easy another
part<00:03:06.520> about<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:06.850> gun<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.450> range

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
part about this gun is that the range

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.410 
part about this gun is that the range
and<00:03:07.870> accuracy<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.500> not<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.070> best<00:03:09.340> even<00:03:10.270> though

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
and accuracy is not the best even though

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.270 
and accuracy is not the best even though
it<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.660> still<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.020> really<00:03:11.320> good<00:03:11.620> gun<00:03:11.800> though<00:03:12.040> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
it is still a really good gun though I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.790 
it is still a really good gun though I
really<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.270> gun<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.140> now<00:03:14.500> let's<00:03:14.710> go

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
really like this gun so now let's go

00:03:14.800 --> 00:04:06.100 
really like this gun so now let's go
outside<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.430> get<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.970> shooting<00:03:16.270> test

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:19.060 

so<00:04:06.710> now<00:04:06.860> let's<00:04:07.100> do<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.370> range

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.590 

so<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:19.730> really<00:04:19.850> effective<00:04:20.210> grinders<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.510> this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
so if really effective grinders of this

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.970 
so if really effective grinders of this
gun<00:04:20.750> there<00:04:20.930> was<00:04:21.050> one<00:04:21.230> dart<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.620> was<00:04:21.710> really

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
gun there was one dart that was really

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.160 
gun there was one dart that was really
weak<00:04:22.160> at<00:04:22.310> one<00:04:22.430> about<00:04:22.640> 11<00:04:23.060> feet<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.360> one<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.050> I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
weak at one about 11 feet and one that I

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.600 
weak at one about 11 feet and one that I
aimed<00:04:24.380> out<00:04:24.530> just<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.770> little<00:04:24.800> bit<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.430> went

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
aimed out just a little bit and it went

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.060 
aimed out just a little bit and it went
a<00:04:25.820> lot<00:04:26.150> farther<00:04:26.360> about<00:04:26.690> 53<00:04:27.290> feet<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.040> rest

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
a lot farther about 53 feet the rest

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.670 
a lot farther about 53 feet the rest
averaged<00:04:28.790> around<00:04:28.910> about<00:04:29.300> 30<00:04:29.720> feet<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
averaged around about 30 feet so the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.990 
averaged around about 30 feet so the
effective<00:04:30.980> range<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.340> gun<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.670> probably

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
effective range of this gun is probably

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.540 
effective range of this gun is probably
