00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.130 
managed to press out that 175 so I'm
thinking<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.940> go<00:02:16.090> up<00:02:16.300> live<00:02:17.080> commentary<00:02:19.140> if

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
thinking I can go up live commentary if

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.390 
thinking I can go up live commentary if
I<00:02:20.260> can't<00:02:20.470> hit<00:02:20.620> 190

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400

over<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> 175<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.920> actually<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.250> this

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
over the 175 or actually I think this

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.539 
over the 175 or actually I think this
might<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:27.620> 155<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.650> something<00:02:29.099> like<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.370> but

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
might be 155 or something like that but

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.670 
might be 155 or something like that but
he<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.599> he<00:02:30.690> chose<00:02:30.840> 175<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.440> he<00:02:31.500> fails

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
he I know that he chose 175 and he fails

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
he I know that he chose 175 and he fails
