00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.910
 Every day in London public transport 

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:10.336
 more than 12 million trips. 

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.751
 Transport infrastructure of this historic city 

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:15.157
 has undergone a fundamental transformation 

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:17.508
 to make travel as fast and easy as possible 

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:19.877
 for Londoners and their visitors. 

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.391
 In view of the impending logistics challenge of the OG 2012, 

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:26.111
 over â‚¬ 8 billion has been invested 

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.991
 to improve service and increase transport capacity, 

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.231
 this modernization has been completed and is fully operational. 

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.335
 These are public transport games - 

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:40.154
 planning in advance and working with the public 

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:42.554
 we must ensure sufficient capacity 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 but we also need to keep London moving, 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.560
 to make the best of the game. 

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:52.027
 Olympic Games 2012 will be the third London Olympics. 

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:56.124
 The transport system has changed greatly since 1948, 

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.211
 when British boxer Ron Cooper and Hungarian swimmer Susan Halter 

00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:03.323
 they used their ID cards to drive around the city. 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.159
 - This is a competitor's card. - Exactly. 

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.839
 This is the bus card we had to prove. 

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.427
 And you know what? We traveled by metro. 

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:18.862
 Watch the door! So it was on the old lines. Watch the door! 

00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:22.565
 A recent visit to the London Transport Museum 

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:24.743
 the two Olympic veterans 

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:26.655
 happy memories of the 1948 Olympics. 

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:29.515
 This is a tank top 

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.315
 in which I boxed for the Olympics in 1948. 

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:37.688
 Whoever wants, says what he wants, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 it's the pinnacle of all sports. 

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.310
 Olympic Games. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 You compete with the world and you have to try, 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.140
 to beat the best. 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 These are the punch, hook and cross. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 Elbow the bottom, chin down and bend your legs 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 to achieve what you want to achieve. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 London Underground is the oldest in the world. 

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:02.800
 It has been transporting passengers since 1863. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 Shipped on weekdays 

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:07.710
 4 million people daily and during games 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 they will grow further. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 After all updates are complete, 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.430
 metro users are reaping the fruits of modernization. 

00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:17.520
 Stratford, East London 

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.580
 OH main hub 

00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:21.810
 is one of the best connected stations in the UK. 

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:24.240
 Staff in the control room 

00:02:24.357 --> 00:02:26.160
 they control the nerve center of the station 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.050
 and like Olympic athletes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.000
 they were trained and prepared. 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
 We all work together 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.800
 We also work with buses, with trips, with the local council. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.600
 Everyone gets the chance to shine at the Olympics. 

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:44.040
 Jubilee Line has increased its capacity 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.370
 and provide efficient transportation 

00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:48.830
 for viewers traveling from central London 

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:50.900
 to the Olympic Park. 

00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:54.760
 The entire metro will go longer and also more often. 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 All viewers get 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.200
 free travel proof in all zones 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 valid on the day of the sports event 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 who are going to visit. 

00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:06.330
 During the Olympic Games, 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.480
 we expect an increase of at least 3 million passengers. 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.660
 People will be able to use their Oyster cards 

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:12.980
 and will be able to travel by bus and metro. 

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.120
 They will be able to use the entire network. 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.670
 One of these buses, 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780
 double-decker Routemaster 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 is an iconic symbol of the city 

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.440
 since it was introduced in the middle of the last century. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500
 New London Bus 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.640
 was recently commissioned 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.300
 and refers to the heritage of Routemastra. 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 This bus has the latest eco technology 

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:35.440
 and also has an open platform to allow passengers 

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.510
 to step in and out at any time. 

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.420
 - Awesome! 

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:41.600
 Line 38 crew 

00:03:41.904 --> 00:03:43.900
 she is extremely proud of being selected 

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:46.270
 to serve this new London icon. 

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:48.910
 It's something I can boast about 

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.120
 my grandchildren, that I was one of the first 

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:52.610
 who could drive him. 

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:53.890
 I'm part of history. 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.750
 And I'm proud to be London, 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170
 because in 2012 the whole world is watching us. 

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.870
 The Javelin is London's first high-speed train. 

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:04.150
 With a speed of almost 230 km / h 

00:04:04.683 --> 00:04:06.680
 from Kings Cross Station in central London 

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:08.940
 gets to the Olympic Park in just 7 minutes. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 During the game, he will run 8 to 10 times per hour. 

00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:14.970
 But both Londoners and visitors are exhorted 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.550
 to use a less modern mode of transport 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 - their own feet. 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.950
 If you have time to look around, 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.300
 it's a great way 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 how to enjoy many of the city's sights. 

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.520
 Cycling and walking are really great ways 

00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:30.630
 how to travel around town and in some cases 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.750
 they are also the fastest ways. 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.410
 In order to get more and more Londoners on bikes, 

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:38.360
 a rentable bicycle system was introduced in July 2010. 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.670
 He confirms the success of the project 

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:43.020
 more than 10 million borrowings since its launch. 

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.920
 The habitat zone is constantly expanding 

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.250
 to meet the demand and time of the Olympics 

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:51.860
 will also go to East London, the seat of the Olympic Park. 

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:54.140
 I think the message for games is, 

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:56.420
 that if we can keep the Londoners moving 

00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.610
 and get all our athletes and viewers on time for games 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.530
 I think we will also have longer-term benefits, 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 that will keep our city moving forward. 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.910
 However, the transport links do not stop at the city boundary. 

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:10.580
 A comprehensive network connects London with cities 

00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.100
 across Britain and Europe. 

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:17.360
 Thanks to international airports 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 serving foreign travelers across Great Britain, 

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.780
 visitors can this summer 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.040
 simply visit the Olympic events 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.280
 and tourist attractions across the country. 

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:34.090
 During the Olympics in 1948 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 all competitors used London traffic 

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:38.970
 to go to and from the sports fields. 

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:43.200
 - We traveled by subway, went to Wembley 

00:05:43.492 --> 00:05:46.790
 and then from Wembley to Hendon, where they fed us, 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.060
 because there were boys 

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:53.110
 and then we went back to St Helen's in Northwood. 

00:05:56.227 --> 00:05:58.530
 - How we got on the bus. 

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:01.210
 They got us a bus to be together. 

00:06:01.352 --> 00:06:03.350
 - Metro was a matter of course for us. 

00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:05.690
 It's a great way to travel. 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.280
 OG 2012 in London promises experiences 

00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:12.010
 and memories for life, 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.230
 as well as games in 48. 

00:06:16.184 --> 00:06:18.180
 - I was extremely happy 

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:20.330
 that I got to the Olympics. 

00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:22.630
 You had to swim very well to get there 

00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:24.870
 and after the war it was not easy to swim. 

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:27.190
 And I always wanted to be in London. 

00:06:29.487 --> 00:06:33.490
 Being at Wembley meant a lot to me. 

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:36.320
 And have an Olympic uniform ... 

00:06:36.757 --> 00:06:38.760
 - You can't get higher anymore, are you? 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.450
 It really is! 

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.280
 It's about hard work and passion. 

00:06:45.058 --> 00:06:48.060
 - I remember that at the opening ceremony 

00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:51.520
 they sent out the idea that the purpose of the Olympics 

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:54.970
 is to win but to participate. - Compete! 

00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:58.440
 - Compete. There was such a big placard. do you remember? 

00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:04.060
