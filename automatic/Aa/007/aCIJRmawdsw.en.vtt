anyway
this<00:01:41.220> track<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:42.030> pretty<00:01:42.210> decent

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this track was actually pretty decent

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
this track was actually pretty decent
pretty<00:01:42.899> good<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:43.439> choppy<00:01:43.740> piano

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
pretty good with a very choppy piano

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.999 
pretty good with a very choppy piano
beat<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:44.759> murky<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.270> dirty<00:01:45.570> drums<00:01:46.200> behind

beat some murky and dirty drums behind
that<00:01:47.399> too<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it's one of the more mature tracks too

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.280
