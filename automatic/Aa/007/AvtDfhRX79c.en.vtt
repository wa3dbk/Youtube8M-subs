00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.469 
closure I did straighten it this is when
I<00:04:52.900> straightened<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:54.160> it's<00:04:55.000> looking<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.330> bit

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
I straightened it so it's looking a bit

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.960 
I straightened it so it's looking a bit
straight<00:04:55.780> now<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.740> matches<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.250> exactly

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
straight now but it matches it exactly

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.659 
straight now but it matches it exactly
so<00:04:58.419> um<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:59.410> took<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.890> off<00:05:00.010> just<00:05:00.190> because<00:05:00.460> I've

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
so um I took it off just because I've

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.700 
so um I took it off just because I've
been<00:05:00.700> wearing<00:05:00.970> closures<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.750> quite<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.140> while

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
been wearing closures for quite a while

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.620 
been wearing closures for quite a while
I<00:05:02.740> just<00:05:03.130> wanted<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.610> few<00:05:03.910> days<00:05:04.060> off<00:05:04.300> from

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
I just wanted like a few days off from

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.740 
I just wanted like a few days off from
closures<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:06.130> took<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.330> off<00:05:07.570> now<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.710> did<00:05:09.070> use

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
closures so I took it off now I did use

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.600 
closures so I took it off now I did use
both<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.080> 18<00:05:11.530> inches<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.039> actually<00:05:12.400> like

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
both of the 18 inches and actually like

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.830 
both of the 18 inches and actually like
a<00:05:12.789> strip<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.860> 16<00:05:15.400> so<00:05:15.760> this<00:05:16.180> is<00:05:16.240> like<00:05:16.570> what's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
a strip of the 16 so this is like what's

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.180 
a strip of the 16 so this is like what's
left<00:05:17.140> of<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.440> 16<00:05:19.500> so<00:05:20.500> that's<00:05:20.680> pretty<00:05:21.010> much

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
left of the 16 so that's pretty much

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.070 
left of the 16 so that's pretty much
what's<00:05:21.520> left<00:05:21.789> like<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.450> under<00:05:22.780> an<00:05:22.840> arm's

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
what's left like just under an arm's

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.480 
what's left like just under an arm's
length<00:05:23.169> so<00:05:23.560> I<00:05:23.590> really<00:05:24.039> didn't<00:05:24.280> you

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
length so I really didn't you

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.400 
length so I really didn't you
that<00:05:25.060> much<00:05:25.300> because<00:05:25.449> in<00:05:25.630> all<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.840> bundles<00:05:26.229> I

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
that much because in all the bundles I

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.980 
that much because in all the bundles I
got<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:26.949> an<00:05:27.910> arm's<00:05:28.210> length<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.720> little

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
got like an arm's length and a little

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.320 
got like an arm's length and a little
bit<00:05:29.139> so<00:05:29.500> yeah<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.370> didn't<00:05:30.610> use<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:30.759> much<00:05:30.970> I

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
bit so yeah I didn't use that much I

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.550 
bit so yeah I didn't use that much I
think<00:05:31.720> if<00:05:31.840> you're<00:05:31.960> going<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.139> get<00:05:32.229> closure

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
think if you're going to get closure

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.420 
think if you're going to get closure
with<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:33.009> hair

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
with this hair

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.010 
with this hair
I<00:05:33.460> really<00:05:34.000> think<00:05:34.150> two<00:05:34.389> bundles<00:05:34.780> will<00:05:34.900> be

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
I really think two bundles will be

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.189 
I really think two bundles will be
enough<00:05:35.229> because<00:05:35.500> like<00:05:36.810> you'll<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:37.870> enough

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
enough because like you'll be enough

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.260 
enough because like you'll be enough
this<00:05:38.349> hair<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:38.740> thick<00:05:39.069> this<00:05:39.400> head<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.729> like
