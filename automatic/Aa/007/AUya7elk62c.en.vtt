00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.530
 I'm mixing a crushed little cup here 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 we have ground the corn because we are going to 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.880
 make some little spots that are a little snack 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.520
 perfect to surprise guests or to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 your family 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.160
 and good how this is done smells this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.650
 choco by hand then to your blender 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.250
 there is also no problem and what 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.320
 You put in a pot and start cooking it 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 this will have more or less an average 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.660
 hour is not so fast that it takes your time 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.560
 have patience let's add 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.900
 the three ingredients first sugar 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.190
 has got two scoops out a little 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.880
 of salt 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.620
 let's throw butter 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.900
 that is the point to remove it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.840
 ok I have cut and choclos 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.560
 pomegranate 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 reserved the banks I reserve the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.300
 internal because I'm going to put here the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.730
 mixture 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.400
 choclo choclo cooked and I will 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.380
 fill with cheese that I have here that is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.590
 a buttery cusqueÃ±o cheese we are going to 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.590
 cut 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.470
 let's cut canes more or less 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 shorts not too thick for you 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.690
 allow you easily fill 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:38.160
 sidewalks I put my piece of cheese on 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.160
 center with a spoon jug and filling 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.740
 He covered that cheese well so that it does not come out 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.430
 the important thing is that it is hot for 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.130
 that the bank sticks to the mass and good 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 we have them here they started to cool and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 That's when they have to grab 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.310
 a bowl of water and water help 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.230
 shape it so that it does not stick in the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.540
 hand I have flour here 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.600
 it can be brown corn flour is a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 normal wheat area 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.550
 let's grab and we will pass the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 little plants by the flour before frying 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.050
 you have to prepare yourself if you put a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 papelito have your skimmer 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.850
 in our pews and even the oil in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.150
 His point 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 what do we do we remove the excess and go 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140
 to put the belly down is 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.450
 important not to stick your finger in because you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.310
 I fried it 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.930
 we have 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.930
 the golden shoulders 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 look at a precious little basket 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 I think we put him here 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.150
 of those plants 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.400
 spectacular 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.400
 look how beautiful everything is 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.040
 presents 62 of guests and they go to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 cover the sheet to the touch 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 It is spectacular 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.819
 now you do like this 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.750
 if the bread that are crispy is worth knowing 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.590
 when you bite it 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.590
 but inside
