project<00:00:00.630> like<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.810> I<00:00:01.260> could<00:00:01.530> say<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:02.070> a

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
project like this I could say is a

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.999 
project like this I could say is a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:00:03.620> opportunity<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.980> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.390 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a
design<00:00:05.430> team<00:00:05.700> like<00:00:06.029> ours<00:00:06.319> we<00:00:07.319> started<00:00:07.980> about

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
design team like ours we started about

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.759 
design team like ours we started about
five<00:00:08.730> years<00:00:08.940> ago<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> clean<00:00:10.380> sheet<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
five years ago with a clean sheet of

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.360 
five years ago with a clean sheet of
paper<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.120> simple<00:00:12.509> task<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.349> design<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
paper and the simple task to design the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.870 
paper and the simple task to design the
best<00:00:14.639> possible<00:00:15.890> car<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> urban

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
best possible car for the urban

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390 
best possible car for the urban
environment<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> megacity<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.100> start

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
environment for the megacity if I start

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.370 
environment for the megacity if I start
with<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> front<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.539> first<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.140> you'll

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
with the front then first of all you'll

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.160 
with the front then first of all you'll
notice<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.490> there<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.850> something<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.960> will

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
notice that there is something that will

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.920 
notice that there is something that will
remind<00:00:25.560> our<00:00:26.160> customers<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.000> BMW<00:00:27.720> brand

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
remind our customers of the BMW brand

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.939 
remind our customers of the BMW brand
the<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:28.920> iconic<00:00:29.480> kidney-shaped<00:00:30.480> grill<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the very iconic kidney-shaped grill the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
the very iconic kidney-shaped grill the
only<00:00:32.160> difference<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.750> an<00:00:33.930> air

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
only difference is that is not an air

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
only difference is that is not an air
intake<00:00:34.380> anymore<00:00:35.160> since<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> an<00:00:36.059> electric

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
intake anymore since this is an electric

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.799 
intake anymore since this is an electric
car<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.590> need<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.550> air<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.180> but

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
car we don't need that much air in but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
car we don't need that much air in but
we<00:00:39.960> felt<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:40.890> keep<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:42.210> with

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we felt we should keep this because with

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.110 
we felt we should keep this because with
it<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.780> course<00:00:43.020> comes<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> promise<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> a

inch<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.470> wheels<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.340> rather

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
inch the wheels are actually rather

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
inch the wheels are actually rather
narrow<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
narrow and that is because of the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
narrow and that is because of the
aerodynamics<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> vehicle<00:01:15.540> everything

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
achieve the optimal aerodynamics because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.609 
achieve the optimal aerodynamics because
that<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.640> give<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.030> customers<00:01:24.240> range<00:01:24.930> there

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that will give our customers range there

is very few lines in our design language
we<00:01:28.530> try<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> achieve<00:01:29.130> maximum<00:01:30.000> effect<00:01:30.390> with

we try to achieve maximum effect with
very<00:01:30.869> few<00:01:31.140> elements<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> lines<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> are

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
very few elements but the lines that are

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.469 
very few elements but the lines that are
there<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:34.460> also<00:01:35.479> communicate

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
there actually also communicate

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.609 
there actually also communicate
precision<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> made<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
precision and the body is made out of

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
precision and the body is made out of
injection-molded<00:01:40.619> thermoplastic<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
injection-molded thermoplastic and that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.569 
injection-molded thermoplastic and that
actually<00:01:42.540> made<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> possible<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.649> make<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
actually made it possible to make this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually made it possible to make this
line<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.149> sharp<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.320> body<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.220> also

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
line so sharp the body is then also

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060 
line so sharp the body is then also
fairly<00:01:48.149> clean<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.799> another

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
fairly clean because that's another

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
fairly clean because that's another
thing<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.549> wanted<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> communicate<00:01:51.470> our

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
thing that we wanted to communicate our

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.490 
thing that we wanted to communicate our
first<00:01:52.770> car<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.790> zero<00:01:54.000> emission<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.290> come

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
first car with zero emission if we come

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
first car with zero emission if we come
to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> rear<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> vehicle<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> see

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
to the rear of the vehicle now you see

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
to the rear of the vehicle now you see
the<00:01:57.869> black<00:01:58.409> belt<00:01:58.759> continuing<00:01:59.759> from<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> roof

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the black belt continuing from the roof

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.999 
the black belt continuing from the roof
into<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.920> tailgate<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:04.009> shining

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
into the tailgate and then shining

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.789 
into the tailgate and then shining
through<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.030> find<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:07.140> rear<00:02:07.320> lamps

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
through you will find the rear lamps

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.890 
through you will find the rear lamps
like<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> modern<00:02:09.319> cell<00:02:10.319> phone<00:02:10.619> off<00:02:10.860> today

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
like a modern cell phone off today

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.440 
like a modern cell phone off today
it's<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.439> black<00:02:12.680> shiny<00:02:12.980> surface<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:14.239> when

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
but we also maximize interior space you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.410 
but we also maximize interior space you
