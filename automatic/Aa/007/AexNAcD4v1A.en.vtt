00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
I think Sanderson Sanderson was feeling

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.229 
I think Sanderson Sanderson was feeling
like<00:02:36.370> obviously<00:02:37.370> he<00:02:37.520> wanted<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:37.940> offensive

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
like obviously he wanted to be offensive

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.240 
like obviously he wanted to be offensive
and<00:02:38.450> take<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> chance<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.709> know<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.010> didn't

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
and take a chance and you know it didn't

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.180 
and take a chance and you know it didn't
work<00:02:40.370> out<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:40.550> him<00:02:41.380> one<00:02:42.380> thing<00:02:42.530> Andrew<00:02:42.830> how<00:02:42.980> is
