00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.400
 hello very good to all and welcome a 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.160
 more day to untie hd what happens what 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.740
 it happens that you have a new episode of the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.510
 show this time we bring you a manucho 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.580
 front manucho del valladolid which is 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.619
 a great season a striker who 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.810
 quite like it because it is such a country of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.849
 angola and that is not known much and 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.760
 thanks to this illusion take it because 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.940
 it would be in bronze it came out of bronze and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.860
 a silver in recognition we are going to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.160
 go a little bit the template and a 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.920
 template of the bbva league 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.620
 iago aspas at maximum 40 and us pitas is 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.540
 a player term also he's going to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.880
 live and for you and for the band and for the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.530
 testa well without me and the field threw it 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.780
 very rocky field center they place that 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.450
 which case and win and the defense that the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.400
 form and take another right side of the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 osasuna to vary and below 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.710
 nacho in the middle and sergio asenjo with dry 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.840
 in game that is the game sometimes but 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 some pretty cantadita open it 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.320
 we went up in the last minutes what 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.710
 we went upstairs to finish as well 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.090
 as if I'm worth 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 so that then lose the tie 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.510
 for just one goal and well there is a manucho 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 that averaged we opened the account in this 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.860
 in my house and their 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.810
 statistics and it ends now 547 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.950
 matches but good in case it is also 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.920
 highly nor to several more goals 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.320
 yes more than anything because there are matches that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.960
 the better the opponent was leaving and therefore 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.940
 they counted the goals or love if you do not have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.560
 right others in life suddenly 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.610
 because we had problems with the equipment or 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.979
 I have to change and therefore I do not 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.800
 tell it for is but has promised 7 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.360
 matches 9 goals a player there are 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.460
 its characteristics you have to throw 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 just up and see how 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.920
 hand out assists as well and he's going to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.509
 give the alarm fight and you will have it and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.970
 characteristics of manucho perform 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.440
 above all his headbutting that is if another of 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.909
 the players that we have tried with a 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.039
 so amazing head an incredible jump 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.110
 and there you see it there it is that it eats 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.080
 whoever and also his shot from far away 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.209
 has a big white shot shorts and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.489
 within the area also does not define very 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.050
 well but good what it does then know 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.250
 to be 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.590
 above all we want to highlight that manucho 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.210
 once he has the ball, take him out 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.300
 puts the body for example although the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.920
 defense run more if you have a l 1 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 triangle like you and here we have the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.070
 key moment of the whole show in a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.320
 penalty shoot but we have to 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.150
 put it because to the paddle if it meets the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.940
 statistics is here facebook 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.200
 a pig with the level is the level and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.340
 it is accepted has only failed 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.600
 adriano I think adriano that you can already 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.920
 know why he has failed because super 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.380
 inside like program the whole story 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.410
 but Adriano is pretty good too and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.420
 Well manucho that as we said it is 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.850
 a player who when he got the ball 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.200
 l 1 triangles and put your body not the 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.820
 will never lose is good I hope that you 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 have liked this show of quite 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.600
 fun with more fight and manucho 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.980
 great and good the same as always in like 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.370
 and until the next girl until the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.370
 next
