00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.559
 musical program with famous style 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.020
 of furor and in which we will see cantizano 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.760
 in a totally different record a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.739
 tell us a bit about the format giving the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.410
 note but giving the note is a duel 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.080
 musical is a permanent party for 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 the months of July and August two 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.580
 Celebrity teams that face face 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.470
 to face also for a goal at the end 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.720
 get a certain amount of 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.820
 money for an ong the team that the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.769
 team that wins have to sing they have 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.449
 that dance they have to jump they have to 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.630
 make us laugh have to respond to 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.240
 questions is a hard program but very 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.619
 very very very fun is a party in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.750
 a television set that goes to 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.880
 go through the screen and you will get 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.289
 to the house I hope that of all the people 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.330
 as well this time you've been 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.360
 off the screens I've had 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.250
 what to do there was a lot of commitment from another 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.440
 professional type like commitment 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.850
 advertising image commitment 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.950
 he has also obviously given me time 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.520
 to rest and I think it was healthy 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.590
 that could have a time of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.390
 oxygenation let's say it like this even 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.409
 that people could rest from jaime 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.369
 Cantizano after 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.710
 of almost 8 years of program so I've 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.539
 come with a lot of energy and on the plate 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.950
 is going to see from the second one the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.899
 program is going to see that I've come with 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.459
 much desire and with much energy after 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.140
 of so many years in front of where are you 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.850
 Heart how are you living that 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.859
 change that antenna3 is experiencing 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.420
 it made a whiter programming for 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.569
 all audiences that does not have three already 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.840
 It had been a while since I believe that 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.490
 producers television networks 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.049
 presenters also teams we have 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.540
 to make a mental effort because in 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.629
 this moment people are asking for another 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.150
 thing that goes in that line before problems 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.160
 as everyday as we are 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.690
 living right now people want 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.670
 Above all, escape, smile, have fun and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.310
 that's why this proliferation of programs 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.569
 that go in that in that fun tone 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.609
 permanent because this is going to be a 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.900
 permanent party after having 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.220
 been in a program that had its 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.420
 moments of tension like where are you 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.000
 now we are going to see you dance 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.330
 sing and everything 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.480
 well you are going to see me not stop for more 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.629
 90 minutes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.489
 where it is impossible for me to get angry 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.319
 where I've spent it and I'm 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.940
 going very well but very well and where 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.620
 you will see me very relaxed because in the end 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.590
 what I was thinking at the end 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.610
 it did not seem like that moment of relaxation 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.700
 working happy with the change of 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.230
 record I am happy working in 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 certain moment of my career 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.000
 professional with such resounding success and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.209
 forceful as important as that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.690
 a historical program and now with this 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.159
 game that is giving the note because not 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.549
 it ceases to be a game a great duel 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.549
 musical
