00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 at sports I find simon maier 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.490
 muscle maker what training can do 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.839
 you can argue that you can argue 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.010
 also disco pump over it 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.990
 If you now argue the legs 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.519
 should train yes or no there 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 from my point of view only an answer 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 Legs are trained and come now 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 we get to the point where it's on everyone 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 If there is no debate, namely the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 squat even for those who are 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 say so much during the training 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 or even one day is not mine 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.619
 cause i know strong both have 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.939
 still want to have a thing 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.050
 thinking about having the squat 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.910
 very special value 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 alone by the stability the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.570
 squat here on the other exercises 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 thus conveys this core stability 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 the in a very special way and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 Wise is demanded and you get too 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.649
 no exercise or no 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 comparable exercise where the core 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 stability in a similar way and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 wisely trained as in the squat so 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.730
 Now we come to the core of the video 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 not to the mistakes again and again 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 I am someone who has 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.629
 also in the squat 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 probably even a very good one 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 direction I developed earlier 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 made horror squats and got 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 mind you may care 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.430
 even with bad technology reasonably 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 increase 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 and i also did many things where 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 I then noticed over time 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 here i come across my limits too 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.200
 but I have to move on again 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.390
 improve technology 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.220
 and that's exactly what we're getting now 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 first mistake that occurs again and again 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.939
 is the thing with a demented ass me 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 do not know how to duck the mensa 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.509
 asterix or something if you just 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 let's see how many people 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.900
 actually heard that one with the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 law to balance back and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 They then believe that it is the important one 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.659
 and the right thing is the po 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 back to balance out then 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.920
 try to go in the booty or the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 yes, to squat somehow 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 Somewhere you get there pretty fast 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 note so deep you do not get the whole 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.750
 usually ends at half 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 repetition and then also at 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 the upward movement we then come to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 the point of the end run to ducks 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.040
 increase makes namely in the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.439
 upward movement will be over again 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.270
 buttocks initiated the upward movement 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.920
 looks really awful like that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.149
 usually also in connection with 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 the weight you do not really have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.200
 mastered often ends then also with 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.549
 some back pain 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 you can imagine it for 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.869
 the intervertebral disc is immense load 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.219
 also just this upward movement over 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 the law over the head 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.470
 to initiate it from my point of view 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.850
 the worst mistake 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.590
 that you do not really get that deep 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.970
 it is only a half repetition 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.260
 times put that explains itself 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.120
 alone by the anatomy that the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.500
 hip then sometime to do so 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.970
 hip blockade ensures that one 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380
 does not come deeper or you go 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.710
 somehow on tiptoe or 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.660
 like this 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.850
 which, of course, again a consequence 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.470
 So mistakes would be very important 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.510
 job calls a bastard that is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.490
 sure and it is synonymous somewhere right though 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.320
 it's just about the tension 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.370
 and belly area so keep that 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.980
 to control weight 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.240
 high voltage and then the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.220
 initiate upward movement over the head 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.690
 and not up first with the po and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.730
 then somehow try the upper body 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.380
 night train subway that does not work 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.640
 I tell you honestly, the car 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.380
 Worst thing you can do if you are 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.880
 notices that everyone is crooked under the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.760
 Rod hangs I believe such a mistake 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.680
 you only do it once in a lifetime 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.240
 the starting position the next point i 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 believe in the place there are many 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.940
 various discussions and many 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.560
 different opinions i want too 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.240
 do not say that my opinion now 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.620
 only right is because you become very 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.780
 many professionals find one 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.880
 Starting position find it barely 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.690
 hip width shoulder width in any case 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.160
 way too narrow 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.720
 that will give some people who say 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 orient yourself by the shoulder width 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.200
 So Braker shoulder stood out of mine 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.730
 already a good thing 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.860
 those who are most board and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 already say they are going to be down 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.459
 certainly hers too 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.170
 but you have the right to exist 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.810
 Of course, do not forget a thing and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.760
 although if your starting position is too angelic 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.890
 will be in the course of the movement in the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.080
 downward movement tend to be with the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.910
 to fall clean inside that is 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.980
 one is what you are in any case 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.510
 should be avoided in the field there 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.400
 no discussions and no debates 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 more iks legs are at squats 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.420
 big problem of course, too 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.980
 the thing with the foot arch also the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.720
 thing you should consider that just 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.070
 not just the knee and the hip, but 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.140
 Finally, the feet also matter 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.790
 play when your arch of the foot collapses 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
 then the entire stand position 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.580
 you can not do it for an ass 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.470
 say differently because I'm there of course 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.340
 ultimately the power is missing 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.870
 come up again 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.910
 so we can do so in the worst 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.500
 fall in combination with one too high 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.600
 Training weight also under the load 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.519
 bury these iks both positions 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.530
 mostly caused by one too 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.360
 you should definitely be in a close position 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.220
 avoid looking at it in any case 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.590
 that in the start position finds the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190
 at least shoulder width there are some 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.810
 People 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.640
 stand there are some people who 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.989
 you have to stand very wide in front of you 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.640
 maybe find out now 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.260
 pay attention that you are the forces 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.120
 the hips are getting apart 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.950
 not together, that's what they do 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.510
 in the downward movement the possibility 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.100
 alone anatomically have really 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.660
 to come down deep and the whole 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.250
 to continue, step by step 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.950
 that maybe someday, too 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.140
 sometimes it comes in the direction of her if that 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.490
 all diligently trained and straight 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.470
 I can train for the hardworking 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.760
 you the group despite recommend linked 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.110
 I also like a video where I am 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.670
 show you that you the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.110
 possibility synonymous have a soft that 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.150
 training to get that yours 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.860
 mobility your agility and just 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.930
 also your coordinative skills 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.460
 get better so that the squat then 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.270
 someday also with a possible 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.980
 low position, I think 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.080
 just what the position of the rod 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.670
 It should be clear to you anyway 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.920
 there are gyms lying there 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.200
 these boxes around and those pillows or 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.000
 Of course, these upholstery looks very much 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.250
 Tempting even when you look 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.270
 says I do not want any traces 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.620
 somehow on my shoulders 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.330
 leave and in the summer you want to 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.830
 of course not why ordered on 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.810
 running around tribe I'll tell you very briefly 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.060
 and just through these cushions you will 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.770
 pretty soon the control with the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.690
 lose the bar on your shoulders 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.000
 I can only recommend you attempt 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.830
 really such a direct relationship as 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.169
 possible to build up the pole and 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.880
 also to build the floor that the best 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.470
 what you can do to increase yourself 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.610
 and you will also see once on the left 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.900
 and on the right, a small plate weighs more 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.940
 you will definitely be one 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.160
 start position need the possible 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.930
 direct as eg barefoot on socks or 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.820
 Weightlifting shoes so definitely 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.950
 no airbags where the kinetic energy 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.240
 Of course, then go on the matter 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.400
 just with the rod I initially 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.080
 has been very important 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.419
 really tries the pole there 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.340
 take off where she belongs and not 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.330
 somewhere around the hot swirl a lot 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.100
 too far up 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.390
 if the rod is a bit far behind 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.520
 you probably do not even have it 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.570
 during the squat the possibility 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.100
 A bit behind the bar again 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.870
 to get in front when you come back 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.400
 Since then I have everything very quickly 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.900
 that I have noticed now goes 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.820
 The rod tends to me a bit 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.320
 well into the cross pure but that gets you 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.880
 but again in the grip during one 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.440
 rod that lies on the vertebrae 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.770
 of course cause the immense damage 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.750
 can 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.060
 So I think that every glass of 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.100
 the place if the dumbbell bar with 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.660
 certain weight training mostly 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.190
 Also a very high weight on the neck 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.139
 vertebra is then ends the matter 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.250
 usually very painful or there can 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.290
 also much more happen 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.700
 I think that just has to be clear from 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.380
 the position I want you this 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.700
 really not too long show there 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.600
 I'm really a cold shower 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.910
 over the back 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.919
 the barbell bar does not belong on the 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.990
 heat bird filed but on the 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.300
 trapezoid in the moment where her shoulder 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.440
 pulls back and the rod reaches 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.810
 that also notes that is one 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.110
 optimal storage space and does not 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.940
 sore 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.470
 So just sit down with one 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.330
 small poem or just take 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.250
 the rod and first finds the 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.630
 right stock position there I have 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.630
 unfortunately already seen a lot of bad 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.430
 especially as far as the vertebrae are concerned 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.139
 I think you can not do much either 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.820
 Do not work out too much 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.830
 not the stake then actually on it 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.660
 where she can do great harm and 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.910
 that's why you meant in any case 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.560
 First, the right position on the 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.419
 find rod or the correct position 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.610
 the rod on the neck For thus 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.290
 Put on the muscle and not on the muscle 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.660
 vertebrae write this behind the 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.130
 all ears clear I hope that I will you 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.020
 could help with the video on 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.210
 which four definitely avoid 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.740
 Should be about training technique over 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.390
 the technique of squats 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.250
 You can always argue, though 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.510
 important is just that you go there 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.130
 and again that makes you feel 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.110
 a small one increases continuously 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.760
 Weight with a controllable weight 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.530
 starts and then steps for 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.450
 step developed what the trainings 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.910
 technology as far as the weights are concerned 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.740
 then comes all by itself all clear 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.390
 I'm so happy about each one 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.100
 Review of you and see you in the 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.990
 next video looks at me too 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.700
 facebook and on instagram over the 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.650
 links are below this video 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.700
 we see you all good greetings 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.700
