00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.479
 you have a record that you have 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.780
 sense in other locations feel the 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:12.269
 case because the spectrum of that radio does not 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 more than 120 kilometers is what we have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.670
 registered so far is an event will be 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.939
 in height that can be triangulated 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 perceive instantly the same 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 time in quite separate areas some 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.270
 of others why we are calculating and the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 disintegration occurred between 45 and 65 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.649
 kilometers in height are phenomena that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.420
 can be predicted from early 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.620
 taking into account the studies and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.940
 observations that have been making 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 you in the laboratory work 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.980
 astronomical in no way is matter 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.660
 interplanetary that one at night the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.659
 observers our others and we do 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.129
 many nights of observation of the sky 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.859
 we can sing normally in one night 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.659
 about 20 meteors that are the 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.879
 traditional let's say not much brightness 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.949
 which lasts a little that are larger 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.350
 that grains of sand let's say entering 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.449
 the atmosphere 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.489
 we can sing sometimes up to two fireballs 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.200
 per night perhaps they are stones of a 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.600
 size of a fist more or less than a 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.820
 dad so you have an idea that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 they enter it is night and they disintegrate 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.630
 one can observe it by day happens what 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.549
 same what happens that I would see the light of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.159
 sun or clouds do not allow us the 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.380
 observation but this you 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.080
 100,000 are permanently calculated 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.270
 daily meteors that enter the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.270
 atmosphere of the earth since our 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.590
 planet that had up to 108 goes to 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.810
 find our stuff that is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.790
 dispersed in space since the times 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.620
 of the formation of the solar system 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 thinking the clarity of his words 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.560
 I would like to ask you why this has been 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.390
 disseminated through the Internet regarding 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 from the near passage to the land of a 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.260
 asteroid that would have the size of three 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.540
 football stadiums you have a 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.370
 report of that phenomenon is always 20 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.760
 a version that circulated so 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.760
 informal 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.330
 a one kind of 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.670
 of steel that are relatively close 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.140
 to the land that are monitored by the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.200
 large observatories in this case is a 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.580
 near asteroid but that has happened to 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.460
 a lot of distance that does not have any 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.290
 relationship with the event 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.250
 that is, we can not wait for any weapon 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.250
 geddon these days 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.030
 through the history of the system 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.930
 solar both the land and the line of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.540
 the moon have cleared their orbit around 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the sun therefore we do not have in 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.810
 orbit in the plane of our planet 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 we do not have any asteroid object that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.460
 may be dangerous to our planet 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.290
 discovered to the present we have 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.910
 for permanent monitoring with radio 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.070
 telescope and with telescope and with 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 satellites therefore we can be 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.750
 rest assured that we have nothing 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.870
 dangerous nearby that on the other hand 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.510
 well also that giving a lot of news is 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.520
 because the martinete of our planet and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.130
 even in a work of art ten times 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.960
 study metro in space is with a 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.360
 tremendous speed 108 thousand kilometers 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.620
 per hour is terrible there will be no speed 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.870
 on another planet that would not be a 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.450
 tremendous chance that an object of 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.890
 large size could position against 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.350
 our planet is a subject that is being 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.990
 opened up a lot of anticipation and we have 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.480
 the technological means nowadays as 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.850
 power to guide a trajectory of a 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.370
 asteroid a comet that virtually 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.260
 was dangerous to our planet today 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.260
 we do not have anything dangerous in sight
