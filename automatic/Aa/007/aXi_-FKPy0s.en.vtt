00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
homemade squirrel cage fan and I just

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
homemade squirrel cage fan and I just
threw<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.729> chunk<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> pipe<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.630> see

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
threw this chunk of pipe you can see

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
threw this chunk of pipe you can see
it's<00:01:36.990> duct<00:01:37.229> taped<00:01:37.470> onto<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.040> eventually

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it's duct taped onto that eventually

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's duct taped onto that eventually
that'll<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.329> away<00:01:39.420> I'll<00:01:39.720> make<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> nice<00:01:40.170> little

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that'll go away I'll make a nice little

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
that'll go away I'll make a nice little
bracket<00:01:40.860> metal<00:01:41.130> bolt<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:44.210> pretty

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
bracket metal bolt on there and pretty

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.330 
bracket metal bolt on there and pretty
blue<00:01:45.450> flame

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.240 

on<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> initial<00:01:49.820> startup<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:50.860> had<00:01:51.860> some<00:01:52.040> really

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
on the initial startup I had some really

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.680 
on the initial startup I had some really
orangey<00:01:52.909> red<00:01:53.530> dirty<00:01:54.530> flame<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.570> found<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
orangey red dirty flame and found the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.940 
orangey red dirty flame and found the
problem<00:01:56.990> with<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> actually<00:01:57.530> turned<00:01:57.860> out

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
problem with that it actually turned out

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.609 
problem with that it actually turned out
to<00:01:58.010> be<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.909> can<00:01:59.030> see<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.390> ignition<00:02:00.170> port

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
to be you can see that ignition port

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.140 
to be you can see that ignition port
there's<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.979> one<00:02:01.250> inch<00:02:01.400> port<00:02:01.670> sticking<00:02:01.940> out<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
there's a one inch port sticking out the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.510 
there's a one inch port sticking out the
side<00:02:02.180> there<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.500> ignition<00:02:03.830> port<00:02:04.250> cap

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
side there and that ignition port cap

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.490 
side there and that ignition port cap
was<00:02:04.790> loose<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.020> leaking

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
was loose and it was it was leaking

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.219 
was loose and it was it was leaking
oxygen<00:02:06.710> into<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.729> was<00:02:07.959> getting<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.020> bad

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
oxygen into it so it was getting a bad

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
oxygen into it so it was getting a bad
mix<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.860> wasn't<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.429> hundred<00:02:10.819> percent<00:02:11.000> oxygen
