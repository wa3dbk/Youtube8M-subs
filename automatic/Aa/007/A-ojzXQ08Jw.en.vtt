00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 yahoo hi to all and local for logan 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.470
 dot fr and in response to xxl podcasts 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.330
 I had some small questions 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.589
 today we will talk about those 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.910
 weird little cylinder it's a 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.910
 vibration speaker 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.620
 so this vibrating insect has been 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.240
 bought on amazon exist two models 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.890
 it is the famous one stand to vibrations 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.360
 with which my teacher pointed 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.040
 English the other day that left me 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.419
 on the ass there are two models so 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.590
 to models 2.5 times a model of 10 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.030
 watts obviously tell me you're the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.680
 more powerful obviously today we 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.770
 talk about the 10 watts I did not test the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.120
 5 watt model this little trick comes in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.040
 their cartons everything is a little bit of everything 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.420
 which is more disgusting in 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.770
 can we say it's not the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.170
 Apple packaging is very far 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.360
 there is a cardboard there is your insects of 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.400
 in a small quiet plastic and 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.780
 so you have your speaker you have 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.800
 a wall charger 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.650
 you have a usb cable aside by whose 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.350
 12 who says anything 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.550
 usb of a side 1 with god cable jack of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.930
 the other side to plug it into your 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.210
 iphone or your computer what you 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.800
 want and mini usb to plug it in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.180
 on the insect on the other side 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.680
 the insect can also connect in 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.130
 bluetooth I will not plugged into 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 bluetooth 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.770
 here I tested them on the floor they me 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.840
 cross English but I do not want to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.229
 the partner on my iphone just for you 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.000
 do the test then and then clear it and 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.740
 then one more I'm still here I 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.140
 I'm still here and there is this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
 so it's a small valve all I 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.410
 did not really see how that could 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.610
 to walk with a sucker I come from 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.410
 test on the glass aka behind this is 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670
 just bluffing and instead of talking to you 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.510
 like that in the wind we will test the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.860
 small enclosure 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 so there's no trap of linselles you 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.980
 arrive in this little box we 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.420
 can open to show that although a 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.370
 fabulous in a small manual 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 this is the guy to print it on his 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.880
 own printer is quiet where the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 that of life from here below here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.390
 there are the little cables that there are there and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.220
 then I have to do that we do not care 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.010
 royally we will put them in the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.070
 box and lay it on the side here there is 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.780
 so the little giulia and is written small 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.170
 20-12 there and I forgot twenty seven who 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 are here cac so the speaker 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.230
 l how does it work you have a 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.119
 little switch that tells you left 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.440
 these men with the little blue light 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.000
 who tells you that there is battery this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 senior official is right this is it 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 bt I mean in bluetooth so there 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.319
 pouffe 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.170
 she connects to bluetooth of bones 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.310
 bluetooth simply and the part 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.050
 from below it's the part that comes 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.260
 vibrate and who will transmit the sound 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 so we'll hook up a set up on the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
 little nest fauna so a mini usb so there 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.270
 I am connected 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.050
 I am wired I come 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.490
 click on like the sound is almost 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 nonexistent if I put you close to the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.630
 we are waiting at the flush of the microphone but 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.190
 it's not fabulous if I put it on the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 metal part and who comes here then 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.550
 obviously that of metal so that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.150
 will vibrate a lot because there are plenty 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.550
 stuff on it but we already hear a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.350
 seems a little nicer if I ask it 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.170
 now on the desk there is next 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.730
 so I should show you actually 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.930
 how to do how do we go let go 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.070
 here to rest that we will have the flesh 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.720
 is enough of the test to do their shopping 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.920
 and then here in front and a glass all 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.850
 just then we'll put it on the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.140
 glass is then less obvious you 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.640
 do not realize because it's my 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.710
 micro who saves so to be forced 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.360
 to trust my microphone and you 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.070
 speak again but the sound is just bluffing 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
 so to a big window of 20 months and the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.060
 his is bluffing for this little insect 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.720
 again if I let go of a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.980
 shower I'm resting here I come to rest 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.710
 surely an office there is right there 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.910
 it's the same if I put it in the middle 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.000
 sorry I lost you this is the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.980
 synthesis makes their choice the sound is 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.080
 still very very good for this 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.610
 1st small that I have taken and 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.050
 who was there where it's funny 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.310
 is that you tell yourself if I want the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.810
 glue and charges istres but so 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.790
 permanent and beyala small suckers 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.290
 here so there is no screw inside 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.660
 there is a thread here outside 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.240
 you come back alive it's his own hand 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.010
 above 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.290
 clack i did anything i said 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.880
 so cleanly 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.230
 this is the part a little galÃ¨re 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.940
 had borrowed me twice just now 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.400
 that's four or five I'm going for a 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.020
 moron's going here I have shod 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.930
 weight of life is a little 8000 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.340
 characteristics though and and b everything 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.200
 simply fixed 5 8 on the glass 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.990
 your window here a little gust of wind 12 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.340
 we press well we lock it well 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.549
 hold well there's no looting actually 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.549
 play 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:29.160
 and so it works in volume I'm for 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.570
 attacking I can it's still a 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.070
 little bit a day each of which today 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.490
 you do not see it's still a small 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.780
 little money 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.669
 So here are children for this little girl 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.960
 libranda speaker is full of models 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.240
 at amazon to you type one this 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.710
 vibrating on amazon simpler if you 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 are on itunes this is vimeo you 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.919
 click on the little link in the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.910
 description of the podcast and you come on 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.800
 the site and you click on the link 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.570
 like that it pays me for work 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.930
 that I do if you ever count in 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.180
 buy a 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.560
 shaw commissioned on it's really 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.120
 a small street that is really bangs 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.800
 so I was asked to talk about it I you 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.040
 talk about it again I dude super 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.440
 nice and then here I would not have believed 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.090
 that the sucker already the grain system 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.470
 pretty bluffing I really would not have believed 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.760
 once fixed to the both valve 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.100
 the meaning would be good but the sound is 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 outright we 're bluffing I'm 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.630
 unable to provide autonomy 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.430
 I was going to find nowhere I'm going 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.740
 to test for about two hours 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.389
 walked without any problem after that 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.680
 something that is still interesting 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.910
 if you plug in if you're doing 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.169
 presentations and typically our offer 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.190
 in the bessin serves for that is this 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.639
 tip with known signs 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.080
 fonniers also seized are totally 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.630
 rotten so expect with his trash 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.039
 did not branch on the table 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.210
 all these presentations like that it's 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.320
 unique she if you ever have to do 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.940
 a presentation would not like bass 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.200
 or tip with without asking yourself on the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.880
 table and in addition to making the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.220
 guys in front of whom you're going to support that 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.260
 you will be good here it was logan 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.760
 for local to point fr 1 2 models 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.130
 again in five months while wall 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.900
 that these models of iwate 63 euros 90 on 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.550
 amazon is a 5- watt model that turns 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.229
 with 30 euros 1,10 by two to little 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.370
 near the price as long as you take it 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.139
 the big one if you can afford it 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.139
 and then I tell you very quickly
