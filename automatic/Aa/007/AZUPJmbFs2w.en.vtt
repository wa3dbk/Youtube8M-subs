it<00:02:02.729> easier<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> see<00:02:03.509> stuff<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> need

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it easier to see stuff and then you need

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
it easier to see stuff and then you need

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the wear patterns I usually change the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.030 
the wear patterns I usually change the
color<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.780> one<00:02:15.930> color<00:02:16.110> I've<00:02:16.319> been<00:02:16.470> doing<00:02:16.680> RIT

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
here you can also make them all

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.380 
here you can also make them all
different<00:02:26.040> colors<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.209> like

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
different colors so you can see you like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.809 
different colors so you can see you like
which<00:02:27.720> part<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.770> affected<00:02:29.250> by<00:02:29.340> what<00:02:29.550> color

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.199 
we're not making any gun skin so it
shouldn't<00:02:32.640> matter<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.390> us<00:02:33.540> too<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:35.209> now

inspect so that you know at what level
of<00:03:03.900> wear<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> roughly<00:03:05.010> looks<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.370> in

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
of wear what it roughly looks like in

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.250 
of wear what it roughly looks like in
game<00:03:05.760> however<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.390> few<00:03:06.569> models<00:03:06.780> look<00:03:07.080> like

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
game however the few models look like

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.860 
game however the few models look like
they're<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.830> old<00:03:08.069> view<00:03:08.970> models<00:03:09.390> from<00:03:09.599> like

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
they're the old view models from like

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.150 
they're the old view models from like
the<00:03:10.049> pate<00:03:10.290> dying<00:03:10.590> early<00:03:11.040> release<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:13.160> if

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
the pate dying early release so and if

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.949 
the pate dying early release so and if
you<00:03:14.370> use<00:03:14.519> different<00:03:14.790> view<00:03:15.269> model<00:03:15.569> settings

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
you use different view model settings

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.509 
you use different view model settings
obviously<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.769> different<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.190> game<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
obviously a lot different in game it

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.460 
obviously a lot different in game it
doesn't<00:03:17.700> followed<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.750> model<00:03:18.900> jiving<00:03:19.290> game

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
doesn't followed the model jiving game

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.560 
doesn't followed the model jiving game
there's<00:03:20.040> also<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.430> reload<00:03:20.760> animation<00:03:20.970> just

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
there's also the reload animation just

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.380 
there's also the reload animation just
in<00:03:21.690> case<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.140> really<00:03:22.470> care<00:03:22.799> about<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.390> will

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
in case you really care about that will

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.050 
in case you really care about that will
go<00:03:24.480> back<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.750> workbench<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.820> here<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.940> can

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
go back to workbench so here you can

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
go back to workbench so here you can
select<00:03:27.209> whatever<00:03:27.480> guns<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.019> want<00:03:28.230> okay<00:03:28.650> I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
want the AWP take a look at AWP let's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970 
want the AWP take a look at AWP let's
say<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.269> want<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> best-looking<00:03:34.319> field-tested

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
say I want the best-looking field-tested

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.870 
say I want the best-looking field-tested
possible<00:03:35.549> I'll<00:03:35.760> be<00:03:36.060> about<00:03:36.260> 0.16<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
possible I'll be about 0.16 on the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.319 
possible I'll be about 0.16 on the
current<00:03:39.269> wear<00:03:39.600> which<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.290> over<00:03:40.829> here<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:42.090> can

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
current wear which is over here you can

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.660 
current wear which is over here you can
see<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> best<00:03:43.019> looking<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.560> tested<00:03:43.980> AWP

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
see that the best looking to tested AWP

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.930 
see that the best looking to tested AWP
for<00:03:44.970> most<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.900> emphasize<00:03:46.530> most<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.250> every<00:03:47.730> piece

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
for most I emphasize most it every piece

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.140 
for most I emphasize most it every piece
looks<00:03:48.480> something<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.790> which<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.940> quite

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
looks something like this which is quite

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.590 
looks something like this which is quite
similar<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.720> my<00:03:52.500> AWP<00:03:53.190> pit<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.700> prefer<00:03:54.030> who<00:03:54.239> paid

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
similar to my AWP pit I prefer who paid

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.660 
similar to my AWP pit I prefer who paid
some<00:03:54.900> attention<00:03:54.930> earlier<00:03:55.709> there's<00:03:56.340> where

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
some attention earlier there's where

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.309 
some attention earlier there's where
here<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.299> where<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.690> other<00:03:57.840> end<00:03:57.930> but

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
here and it's where the other end but

at<00:05:33.360> all<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.680> probably<00:05:34.890> have<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.280> look<00:05:35.400> for

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
at all and you probably have to look for

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.990

minimal way minimal way it looks better

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.020 
minimal way minimal way it looks better
it<00:05:39.410> gets<00:05:40.410> better<00:05:40.590> as<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.040> goes<00:05:41.340> closer<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:41.970> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
it gets better as it goes closer to the

it gets better as it goes closer to the

factory new so yeah I'll leave it to you

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.740 
factory new so yeah I'll leave it to you
guys<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:45.960> experiment<00:05:46.820> but<00:05:47.820> before<00:05:48.240> I<00:05:48.300> finish

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
guys to experiment but before I finish

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.420 
guys to experiment but before I finish
I'll<00:05:48.960> show<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.290> guys<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.680> five-seven<00:05:50.220> which

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
I'll show you guys the five-seven which

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.250 
I'll show you guys the five-seven which
is<00:05:50.580> another<00:05:50.940> one<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.240> those<00:05:51.479> guns<00:05:51.780> that<00:05:51.960> have

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
is another one of those guns that have

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.480 
is another one of those guns that have
extremely<00:05:52.770> differing<00:05:54.680> amount<00:05:55.680> of<00:05:55.890> wear<00:05:56.130> if

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
extremely differing amount of wear if

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.850 
extremely differing amount of wear if
you<00:05:57.090> paid<00:05:57.300> any<00:05:57.510> attention<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:58.080> five-sevenths

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
you paid any attention to five-sevenths

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.250 
you paid any attention to five-sevenths
before<00:05:59.160> this<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.610> fuel<00:05:59.820> tested<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:02.990> this<00:06:03.990> is

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
before this is fuel tested and this is

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.130 
before this is fuel tested and this is
also<00:06:04.500> fuel<00:06:04.800> tested<00:06:05.360> but<00:06:06.360> you<00:06:06.510> can<00:06:06.660> see<00:06:06.900> that

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
also fuel tested but you can see that

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.500 
also fuel tested but you can see that
there's<00:06:07.290> a<00:06:07.380> lot<00:06:07.620> more<00:06:07.800> wear<00:06:08.070> on<00:06:08.100> here<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:09.479> you

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
there's a lot more wear on here so you

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.180 
there's a lot more wear on here so you
gotta<00:06:09.750> be<00:06:09.840> careful<00:06:10.110> if<00:06:10.560> you're<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.950> kind<00:06:11.160> of

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
gotta be careful if you're the kind of

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.430 
gotta be careful if you're the kind of
person<00:06:11.250> we<00:06:11.669> cannot<00:06:11.880> stand<00:06:12.300> having<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:13.080> lot<00:06:13.410> of
