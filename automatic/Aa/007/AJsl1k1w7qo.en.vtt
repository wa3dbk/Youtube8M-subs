that<00:00:27.080> we<00:00:27.230> got<00:00:27.439> fun<00:00:27.939> comforters<00:00:28.939> as<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:29.980> it's

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
that we got fun comforters as well it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.690 
that we got fun comforters as well it's
basically<00:00:31.429> running<00:00:31.730> off<00:00:31.999> of<00:00:32.530> 12<00:00:33.530> volts<00:00:34.010> and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
basically running off of 12 volts and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.840 
basically running off of 12 volts and
its<00:00:35.690> current<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:38.050> half<00:00:39.050> full<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:40.130> little<00:00:40.640> less

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
its current is half full a little less

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.870 
its current is half full a little less
than<00:00:41.770> an<00:00:42.770> hour

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880

you<00:00:45.880> also<00:00:46.000> have<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.690> bigger<00:00:46.990> model<00:00:47.890> for<00:00:48.160> it

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
you also have a bigger model for it

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.170 
you also have a bigger model for it
which<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:49.150> enough<00:00:49.570> computers<00:00:50.910> computer<00:00:51.910> files

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
which is enough computers computer files

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.860 
which is enough computers computer files
and<00:00:53.050> one<00:00:53.470> to<00:00:54.280> me<00:00:54.430> 15

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
and one to me 15

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.709 
and one to me 15
and<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.890> also<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.219> lamp<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:01.040> from<00:01:01.670> a

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
and this is also a lamp it's from a

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.490 
and this is also a lamp it's from a
bucket<00:01:02.719> some<00:01:03.530> wood<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.000> some<00:01:05.000> LED<00:01:05.540> LED<00:01:06.290> lights

and<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:07.790> spring<00:01:08.299> photo<00:01:08.960> Fang<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:10.759> we<00:01:11.000> put<00:01:11.210> it

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
and a spring photo Fang so we put it

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.690 
and a spring photo Fang so we put it
together<00:01:11.479> wired<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.140> up<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:13.100> works
