00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.119
 so I'm a photographer reporter for 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 the sipa press 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.619
 I'm doing a lot of news this is at 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.329
 to say I am politicians 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.210
 much social as regards 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:32.160
 demonstrations in the streets etc and I 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 do the magazine actually I also 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.800
 realized that with the real material 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.600
 pro big appliances 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.830
 there is a species when we start to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.360
 to scrape people and it's a 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.040
 aggression because it's big 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 material and I realized 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.150
 that with the ix20 down it was happening 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.380
 much better people agree to 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.370
 a lot more to be photographed then 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.930
 they are wrong 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 it is slightly larger than the ix20 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.220
 there are big changes anyway 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 that they are who intervened 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.700
 ergonomics and is better than the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.390
 ix20 the buttons are better placed for 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.009
 do a manipulation on the case 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 with this being the same sensor the 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.460
 jpeg image processing is really 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.620
 better best definition 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.050
 besides stitched image with the x30 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.030
 now will cost ya 1600 chance without 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.140
 to have too much noise is still very 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 very widely exploitable 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.320
 the speed of the case is very good 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 I test them in jpeg configuration 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.990
 from afar what is still moment 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 as the resource to your housings and 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.570
 assumes the autonomy of the housing of the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 x30 has been improved compared to the xv in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.410
 did 350 photos 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.350
 his problem and then then there is 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.870
 some novelties that are still 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.560
 to say enough it's grandiose already by 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.170
 example the electronic viewfinder that wants 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.390
 to say that now when one car because a 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.280
 picture in the viewfinder on at 100% of this 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.340
 that we tell pictures have made 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.990
 really definitive framings so have 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.200
 for that it is an improvement which is 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.420
 very clear 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.730
 the back screen is bigger and then 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 there is a function that is really very 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.929
 interesting is the fact of being able 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.490
 unfold this screen to put it in 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.290
 position 90 degrees with respect to 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.970
 boxes and what makes it work 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.590
 in a very discreet way and in addition 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.330
 to do down plunges or to 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.010
 put the case on the ground sometimes 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.330
 angles that are superb months then there 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.890
 I find it really great there is the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.020
 new function the new ring he 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.840
 are two rings for the same yard of 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.330
 bring the box and workers 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.730
 closer to the case there is a new 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.610
 ring can change the diaf change the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.750
 devil turning the ring his table 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.370
 also when we view the photos 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.230
 behind two to enlarge them with the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.230
 ring it is very convenient 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.570
 me what interests me in the function 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.800
 wi fi it's to transfer very 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.239
 quickly my images admit that 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.270
 it's in the street there's a 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.980
 event 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.840
 in front of my eyes I do 3 pts and image 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.180
 on the phone and I send directly 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.340
 my images to the leg then the function 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.740
 time I have not tested but it's 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.920
 hyper interesting I always in 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.740
 the idea of ​​flying over with a drone 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 of a building or a landscape and that that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.970
 is going to be a really great function 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.430
 interesting so continue with the x e 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.790
 30 with pleasure that's what it would be 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.740
 happiness 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.740
 see you soon thank you
