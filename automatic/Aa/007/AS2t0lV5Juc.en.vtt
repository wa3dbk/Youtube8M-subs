00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.620
First I use the BB Lunch Box

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700
It has jelly texture so it's great for oil control

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.440
The color is natural, light and smooth with great coverage

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.960
Don't forget that this lunchbox also contains concealer and highlighter

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.140
Use concealer to hide dark circles

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.060
Apply highlighter on the tip of the nose , forehead , chin and the under eyes area. That will make the face look brighter

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360
To finish the base, I use powder pact from TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.540
It has high SPF, perfect for sunny days

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.120
Beside that, it has tiny glitter dust, which will help us get the bright,dewy look like Korean

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.320
I use brown eyebrows pencil to form horiazontal brows but a little up

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.040
Remember to choose the pencil that match your hair color,guys!

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.060
Then use the powder to apply on, create more natural look

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.900
You'll need eyebrow mascara for perfection

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.720
Apply light brown eyeshadow on the eyelids with brush

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.500
Also add on the lower lashlines

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.440
Next, use blending brush to apply darker brown eyeshadow to create darker and bigger eyes

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.040
And also on the lower lashlines

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.480
Apply thin lines at the inner corner and darker by the end of the eyelines

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.900
This gel eyeliner has fine color,not too dark or too black

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.540
Apply on 2/3 of the lower lashlines as well

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.220
I apply false eyelashes

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.540
You could choose the black glue ,that would match your eyeliner color

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.900
While waiting for the glue to get dry,we will move to blushing

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.560
Apply light bronzer to the cheeks

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.220
Then use volume mascara

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.260
Wait a few seconds for the mascara to dry and use lashes curler

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.920
Don't forget to use lip balm before applying lipstick

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120
This balm has orange scent,make me just want to swallow it

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.100
I'm still loyal to Innisfree lip concealer

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.420
I use lip tint in milky orange from TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.360
Apply too much might cause glossy lips. Just wait a bit then it will be perfect

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.120
Just apply a little orange blush and we're done!

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.660
Add a few roses on the hair

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.480
Apply pastel yellow eyeshadow on the eyelids

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.760
and add light purple brown at the end

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.380
The highlight of the concept is yellow so I apply the lower lashlines with glitter gold eyeshadow

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:57.060
Create triangle ends like these and drag to 1/3 of the lower lashlines

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.440
Add false eyelashes and start to apply contour

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.680
Apply contour that darker than the red rose look

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.620
Then apply on the sides of the nose as well

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.200
Apply glittery gold lipgloss on first

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:08.720
Then use orange lip marker from 3CE to apply on the inner lips

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:29.240
Add orange blush,wig and flower and we're finished!
