00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.650
 of how to play dead island but low 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.840
 the minimum requirements I can play to 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.939
 dead island with normal requirements 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.939
 but many people want to play it and not 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.920
 can for the performance of your pc like this 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.420
 here is a tutorial on how to play it 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.030
 without the minimum requirements 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.510
 obviously close to him do not expect that 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.340
 a PC of less than 256 megabytes of video a 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.100
 fairly decent processor or 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.020
 empowered them to run here goes the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.629
 good tutorial the first thing we have 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.909
 what to do is go to the folder where we have 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.699
 installed the game in my case I'm going to 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.429
 team then to local disk then to the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.350
 dead island folder the second already inside 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.809
 from the dead install folder 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.339
 island there are two options the first is to go 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.190
 to the folder called out 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.109
 and they enter you there if they do not find a 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.629
 file called video is because it is not 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.089
 there the second option is to go back and go 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
 of the folder and enter there then 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.469
 we headed out 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.899
 we enter you and we will get audio and video 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.850
 in some case if they have windows 7 they do not 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.740
 will allow opening the file what 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 we will make it in that folder to create a 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.299
 text document after this 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.219
 we support the file that we will occupy 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.170
 which will be the video by any type 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.270
 of inconvenience ready that now 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.819
 we drag the folder called video the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.259
 original not supported we drag 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.720
 to the text document 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.869
 then this will come out now he has already opened 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.880
 this we will review and we will realize 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.130
 that is how to edit the resolution or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.069
 graphic potential of the game do not 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.170
 nothing yet now after revised 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.209
 we will edit the following points of this 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.759
 folder that I will show you on the screen 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.939
 with the designated values ​​on the screen 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.979
 we will copy them exactly the same then 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.500
 they keep it with what they edited they go back to 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.939
 check it to see if it was saved if you did not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.159
 kept make another with the values 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.380
 indicated on the screen and replace it 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.450
 by the original already done that they close and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 they go to the game if you do not run them yet it's 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 because the pc is not able to run it with 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.569
 no possibility or if it does not follow 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 trying to lower more and more those 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.640
 levels without my responsibility 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.530
 remember to always back the files 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 that edit do not change so as not to commit 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.760
 errors do not edit in the values ​​within 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 of the game because it will cancel what they have 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.200
 edited in the folder that we use called 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.810
