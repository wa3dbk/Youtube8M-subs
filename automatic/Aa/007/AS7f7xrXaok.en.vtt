00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:31.939
 Hand in the dough let's start cooking 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:35.629
 I'm going to mix shitake champion this 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.430
 young Internet user moves one of the pan online 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.830
 most important names in gastronomy 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.699
 Brazilian and now star of television 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.979
 It's very simple, it 's Brazil in the plate. 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.400
 carla pernambuco here take the 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.100
 Brazilian cuisine to television 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.710
 a certain moment a cold does not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.629
 inflation looks is people like 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.519
 things are very different or not 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.699
 the Brazilian market now 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.979
 food is what I tried to do in brazil 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.619
 same dish type of cuisine that I 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.540
 Practico carlota 17 years old 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.490
 so I try to bring it in. 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.690
 of the program a multicultural kitchen 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.240
 bring Brazilian regional cuisine 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.090
 but also mix with all our 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.070
 colonizers and immigrants who made the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.990
 Brazil being the way he is then 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.760
 Of course it gave me a cold in the belly but 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.620
 I'm very proud of the brazil project 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.130
 on the plate I made all the contents of the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.170
 product design and and along with fox 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.730
 we have done this realization that is 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.980
 going to the third season we 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.870
 recorded the first one in buenos aires in 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.990
 The second we have already recorded in SÃ£o Paulo 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.240
 in a format slightly different than it is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.340
 a communication program that speaks of 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.430
 then he has guests who 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.260
 they are often heads of state other than 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.580
 we cook together for the next 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.470
 season we want to bring the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.010
 viewers to cook together 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.159
 With us but I see Brazil in the dish 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.950
 as a multicultural program not only of 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.049
 purely Brazilian cuisine but I think 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.900
 that he, along with the other 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.820
 channel he raises gives a raise in the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.489
 Brazilian cuisine without a doubt that we 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.650
 We are brazilians and the fact of the people is 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.870
 on the television that's talking about 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.540
 cook for the whole brazil that changes 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.760
 completely the way 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.590
 people see the Brazilian cooking 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 cooking, it allows you to 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.310
 combinations, not even Brazil. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.150
 to meet with France suddenly to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.430
 England 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.680
 That's right, it's an art that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.730
 enables many new looks 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.670
 palates 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.989
 Then I think the kitchen is after 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.150
 language in a culture is an el 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.069
 factor of identification of a culture 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.939
 so when you come when you remember 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.400
 of a place 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.859
 you remember the foods that place and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.269
 Do you remember, the way you talk about that? 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.129
 place so I guess the food when 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.129
 Are you going to turkey for example? 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.150
 is in the middle of a recording as well 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 simple 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.689
 we recorded it in a little while 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.269
 now the recording will start can be 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.829
 london based breaks she has to go 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.829
 Pro Special Metal Trash 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.650
 unjust milk 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.750
 Did you watch the TV show? 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.069
 so the recording happens to us 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.890
 continue chat we come to a 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.629
 second kitchen that is not the scenographic 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.900
 that the real kitchen here is the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.670
 people prepare the dishes that will appear 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.660
 on television with television has a 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.400
 short time 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.379
 many times we have to make three 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.560
 I did the same dish yesterday anyway. 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.440
 a pie she appeared she had the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.700
 ingredients to make the pasta in the air 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.530
 but she already had a ready and a salad 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.170
 so she had three moments of the same 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.459
 recipe and this kitchen here 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.650
 specialized in this, which is something that 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.190
 people do not realize this but 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.680
 here is the piece of the program 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.379
 tv that has to run the most 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.840
 important it is super important that 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.090
 the presenter knows how to communicate is very 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.690
 important but this moment here because 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.190
 if you receive a food that is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.500
 completely different from what it is already 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.000
 the disaster and the insecurity that the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.019
 presenter will stay so it is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.250
 fundamental 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.729
 the backside is not the kitchen behind the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.300
 scene is very well coordinated has a 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.590
 boss who knows the television in order to 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.650
 prepare things as they should be. 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.680
 first, the next one was there. 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.710
 that children can not resist being the egg 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.210
 in the oven pizza flavor 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.030
 I'm going to do a walk with the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.919
 tomatinhos here bemsimples I like 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.750
 enough of the design of the simple good that the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.630
 design simple it requires a lot of 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.220
 research that all for example and if 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.650
 this past season 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.190
 each topic was about a country on a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.880
 a culture so I had to look 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.240
 a guest fit for that 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.760
 culture mix up also professional 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.010
 with non-professionals in order to be able to 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.960
 feeling that people at home can 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.550
 also make it clear that it is not only 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.889
 professional chefs who can 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.669
 to run a recipe so this one 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.130
 balance of things that always make me 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.320
 in love with the project link 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.009
 Brazil in the dish is a pleasure to talk to 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.990

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.839

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:43.339

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.180
 one takes a different herb and each one 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.199
 It is with a very different taste in each 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.199
 one with its own way
