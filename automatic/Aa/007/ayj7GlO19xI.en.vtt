00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
the game grounded that it shouldn't get

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.950 
the game grounded that it shouldn't get
too<00:00:17.919> far<00:00:18.279> into<00:00:18.339> kind<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.820> a<00:00:18.939> sci-fi<00:00:19.179> and<00:00:19.720> stuff

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
too far into kind of a sci-fi and stuff

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.880 
too far into kind of a sci-fi and stuff
and<00:00:20.109> I<00:00:20.169> was<00:00:20.199> hoping<00:00:20.380> you<00:00:20.560> could<00:00:20.619> kind<00:00:20.859> of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
and I was hoping you could kind of

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.979 
and I was hoping you could kind of
expand<00:00:21.339> on<00:00:21.460> what<00:00:21.489> that<00:00:21.849> means<00:00:22.119> yeah<00:00:22.689> i<00:00:22.720> think

you know when you say you're making a

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.589 
you know when you say you're making a
game<00:00:25.060> that's<00:00:25.499> that<00:00:26.499> set<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:27.159> decade<00:00:27.909> or<00:00:28.179> 13

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
game that's that set a decade or 13

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.889 
game that's that set a decade or 13
years<00:00:28.630> out<00:00:29.109> you<00:00:29.470> know<00:00:30.479> that<00:00:31.479> could<00:00:31.659> mean<00:00:31.809> a<00:00:31.839> lot

years out you know that could mean a lot

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.360 
years out you know that could mean a lot
of<00:00:32.170> things<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.560> lot<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.800> different<00:00:33.130> people

get around a group of game designers
you're<00:00:41.050> definitely<00:00:41.230> not<00:00:41.410> going<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.710> get<00:00:41.830> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
you're definitely not going to get the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.510 
you're definitely not going to get the
same<00:00:42.490> answer<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:44.020> what<00:00:44.350> we<00:00:44.440> did<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.680> we<00:00:44.830> is<00:00:45.250> we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
same answer so what we did is we is we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.700 
same answer so what we did is we is we
really<00:00:45.940> sort<00:00:46.240> of<00:00:46.330> entrenched<00:00:46.720> ourselves<00:00:47.590> in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
really sort of entrenched ourselves in

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.090 
really sort of entrenched ourselves in
trying<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.970> make<00:00:49.330> sure<00:00:49.510> that<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:50.170> know<00:00:50.290> the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
trying to make sure that you know the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.040 
trying to make sure that you know the
fiction<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.460> we're<00:00:51.640> going<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.820> create<00:00:52.050> had

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
fiction that we're going to create had

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.930 
fiction that we're going to create had
to<00:00:53.200> be<00:00:53.290> plausible<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.040> had<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.370> be<00:00:54.400> grounded

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
to be plausible it had to be grounded

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.870 
to be plausible it had to be grounded
but<00:00:55.390> at<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.600> same<00:00:55.810> time<00:00:56.400> you<00:00:57.400> know<00:00:57.490> not<00:00:57.730> get

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
but at the same time you know not get

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.900 
but at the same time you know not get
too<00:00:58.030> conservative<00:00:58.570> with<00:00:58.720> it<00:00:58.840> because<00:00:59.910> you

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
too conservative with it because you

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.520 
too conservative with it because you
know<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.270> was<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.600> was<00:01:01.720> interesting<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.170> note

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
know it was it was interesting to note

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.459 
know it was it was interesting to note
that<00:01:02.560> as<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.550> were<00:01:03.670> doing<00:01:04.030> that<00:01:04.210> oftentimes<00:01:05.140> we

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
that as we were doing that oftentimes we

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:06.660 
that as we were doing that oftentimes we
found<00:01:05.679> ourselves<00:01:05.829> being<00:01:06.249> a<00:01:06.340> little<00:01:06.460> too

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
found ourselves being a little too

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.880 
found ourselves being a little too
conservative<00:01:06.880> at<00:01:07.359> times<00:01:07.569> it's<00:01:08.319> really<00:01:08.499> really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
conservative at times it's really really

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.819 
conservative at times it's really really
surprisingly<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.520> what<00:01:09.609> we<00:01:09.670> did<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.829> aside

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
surprisingly so what we did is aside

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.069 
surprisingly so what we did is aside

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
in helping us identify some of those

in helping us identify some of those
trends<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.139> and<00:01:44.529> how<00:01:44.740> that's<00:01:44.979> going<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
trends and and and how that's going to

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.340 
trends and and and how that's going to
be<00:01:45.340> used<00:01:45.579> in<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.600> battlefield<00:01:46.929> in<00:01:47.259> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
future he was also helpful and sort of

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.989 
future he was also helpful and sort of
guiding<00:01:50.770> us<00:01:50.889> and<00:01:51.100> because<00:01:51.670> there's<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.819> lot<00:01:51.850> of

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
guiding us and because there's a lot of

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.249 
guiding us and because there's a lot of
things<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.389> are<00:01:52.479> out<00:01:52.600> there<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.170> know

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
things that are out there that you know

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.569 
things that are out there that you know
one<00:01:53.439> of<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.590> things<00:01:53.619> that<00:01:53.889> might<00:01:54.159> be<00:01:54.310> more

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
one of the things that might be more

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.459 
one of the things that might be more
considered<00:01:55.179> you<00:01:55.479> know<00:01:55.509> vaporware<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.289> what's

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
considered you know vaporware and what's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.059 
considered you know vaporware and what's
maybe<00:01:56.679> more<00:01:56.999> practice<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.920> because

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
maybe more practice just because

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.620 
maybe more practice just because
something<00:02:00.249> exists<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:00.819> as<00:02:00.909> plausible<00:02:01.119> doesn't

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
something exists in as plausible doesn't

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.649 
something exists in as plausible doesn't
mean<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:01.869> might<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.770> same<00:02:02.950> time<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.569> had<00:02:04.569> to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
mean it might the same time we had to

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.300 
mean it might the same time we had to
make<00:02:04.749> decisions<00:02:05.170> about<00:02:05.259> game<00:02:05.829> play<00:02:06.069> and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
make decisions about game play and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.550 
make decisions about game play and
making<00:02:06.880> sure<00:02:07.179> that<00:02:07.209> that<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.869> fit<00:02:08.229> as<00:02:08.350> well

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
making sure that that that fit as well

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.590 
making sure that that that fit as well
but<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:09.400> know<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.759> was<00:02:09.880> important<00:02:10.300> for<00:02:10.330> us<00:02:10.570> to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
but you know it was important for us to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300 
but you know it was important for us to
make<00:02:10.900> sure<00:02:10.930> that<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.650> if<00:02:11.950> we're<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.250> to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
make sure that that if we're going to

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.000 
make sure that that if we're going to
you<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.700> create<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
setting in them in the future that it

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350

retained<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> characteristics<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.180> how<00:02:18.299> we

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
retained the characteristics of how we

retained the characteristics of how we
create<00:02:18.569> our<00:02:18.810> our<00:02:19.049> historical<00:02:19.950> pasts<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.329> our

create our our historical pasts and our
process<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:23.010> very<00:02:23.069> similar<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> way

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
process was very similar in that way

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.670 
process was very similar in that way
it's<00:02:24.299> like<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.659> know<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.780> fear<00:02:25.079> it's<00:02:25.530> well

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's like you know it's fear it's well

unfold in the future not just how is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.039 
unfold in the future not just how is
warfare<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.159> it's<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.579> how<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.780> house

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
warfare and it's like how was the house

warfare and it's like how was the house
the<00:02:46.200> world<00:02:46.409> can<00:02:46.560> unfold<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.159> were<00:02:47.250> looking

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the world can unfold so we were looking

that I showed you was a particular level

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.800 
that I showed you was a particular level
where<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:54.430> lot<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.460> things<00:05:55.760> have<00:05:55.940> converged<00:05:56.360> for

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
where a lot of things have converged for

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.510 
where a lot of things have converged for
sure<00:05:57.020> like<00:05:57.290> this<00:05:57.560> is<00:05:57.710> where<00:05:57.890> that<00:05:58.070> place<00:05:58.340> in

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
sure like this is where that place in

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.500 
sure like this is where that place in
the<00:05:58.610> fiction<00:05:58.970> we're<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.120> lot<00:05:59.240> of<00:05:59.330> things<00:05:59.390> that

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
the fiction we're a lot of things that

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.060 
the fiction we're a lot of things that
converge<00:05:59.840> there's<00:06:00.590> going<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.800> be<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:00.890> lot<00:06:01.040> of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
converge there's going to be a lot of

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.490 
converge there's going to be a lot of
events<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.850> you<00:06:02.570> know<00:06:02.690> total<00:06:03.110> deniable

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
events that you know total deniable

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.350 
events that you know total deniable
operations<00:06:04.040> that<00:06:04.160> nobody<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.910> nobody<00:06:05.210> knows

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
operations that nobody that nobody knows

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.420 
operations that nobody that nobody knows
about<00:06:05.930> or<00:06:06.350> knows<00:06:06.860> what's<00:06:07.040> going<00:06:07.280> on<00:06:07.370> and

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
about or knows what's going on and

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.950 
about or knows what's going on and
that's<00:06:07.580> part<00:06:07.940> of<00:06:08.030> I<00:06:08.150> think<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.480> excitement<00:06:08.720> of

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
that's part of I think the excitement of

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.390 
that's part of I think the excitement of
black<00:06:09.170> ops<00:06:09.350> is<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.770> we<00:06:09.920> can<00:06:10.040> put<00:06:10.220> you<00:06:10.340> in

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
black ops is that we can put you in

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.120 
black ops is that we can put you in
those<00:06:10.580> scenarios<00:06:11.390> and<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.380> those<00:06:12.950> are<00:06:13.070> the

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
those scenarios and and those are the

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.060 
those scenarios and and those are the
deniable<00:06:13.550> operations<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.630> that<00:06:15.260> you<00:06:15.950> know

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
deniable operations that that you know

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.130 
deniable operations that that you know
they're<00:06:16.400> off<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.670> radar<00:06:16.900> and<00:06:17.900> you're<00:06:18.020> going

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
they're off the radar and you're going

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.810

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
to have those situations too so it's a

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.970 
to have those situations too so it's a
it's<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.090> combination<00:06:20.390> of<00:06:20.870> both<00:06:21.320> of<00:06:21.590> those<00:06:21.650> will

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
it's a combination of both of those will

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.810 
it's a combination of both of those will
get<00:06:22.130> the<00:06:22.340> kind<00:06:22.550> of<00:06:22.990> violent<00:06:24.220> no<00:06:25.220> arrived<00:06:25.700> in

get the kind of violent no arrived in
the<00:06:25.910> darkness<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.390> they<00:06:26.450> will<00:06:26.570> get<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.750> big

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
the darkness and they will get the big

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.140 
the darkness and they will get the big
