it's<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.170> winding<00:00:58.649> something<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's like winding something up at the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
it's like winding something up at the
same<00:01:00.239> time<00:01:00.449> she<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:00.600> great<00:01:00.840> power<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.350> she<00:01:01.410> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
same time she has great power so she can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
same time she has great power so she can
release<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> torque<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:03.359> allows<00:01:03.660> her<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
release the torque which allows her to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
release the torque which allows her to
spin<00:01:04.170> quickly<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> air<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> her<00:01:05.700> body

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
spin quickly in the air and her body

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
spin quickly in the air and her body
awareness<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:06.750> precise<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.650> she<00:01:07.710> knows

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
awareness is very precise so she knows

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.320 
awareness is very precise so she knows
exactly<00:01:08.130> where<00:01:08.549> she<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.760> she<00:01:09.060> keeps<00:01:09.240> her

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
exactly where she is she keeps her

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.730 
exactly where she is she keeps her
shoulders<00:01:09.659> level<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.049> her<00:01:10.110> hips<00:01:10.320> level<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
shoulders level at her hips level and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
shoulders level at her hips level and
her<00:01:10.799> feet<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.010> nice<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> tight<00:01:11.549> together<00:01:11.750> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
her feet are nice and tight together so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
her feet are nice and tight together so
there's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> sense<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.500> defying<00:01:13.830> gravity

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there's a sense of just defying gravity

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.370 
there's a sense of just defying gravity
too<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.320> you

too that when you are up there that you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.190 
too that when you are up there that you
can<00:01:16.830> defy<00:01:17.670> gravity<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.600> linger<00:01:18.990> at

the whole jump she can execute a nice

I<00:02:25.130> don't<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> lot<00:02:25.760> during<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> jump

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
I don't think a lot during the jump

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.540 
I don't think a lot during the jump
because<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.810> happened<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.200> quickly<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.370> it's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
because it happened so quickly now it's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.280 
because it happened so quickly now it's
almost<00:02:28.730> instinctual<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:29.840> my<00:02:29.960> body's

almost instinctual like my body's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.810 
almost instinctual like my body's
