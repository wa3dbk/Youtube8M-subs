00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello guys this is another creation of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.439
 Minecraft 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.449
 is not really doing something great just 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.239
 It's like a tiny tower of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 surveillance this part for games of 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:34.470
 hungry ' game good games of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.090
 Survival maps of adventures in a 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.970
 sense 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 and it really is not much, it's just a 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.790
 arrangement with here to eliminate this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.590
 part of here the posts to hold or 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.040
 If I rise not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.890
 the stairs that lead here that 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.239
 I'm looking at you and I 'm exposing this 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.550
 It can also work like a house 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.240
 why 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.180
 It gives quite the truth 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.260
 may or may not be can be put 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.260
 stairs for here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.100
 Oh 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.479
 here it is simply put 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.350
 with a bed a the ovens the table of 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.560
 kraft eo 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 it's already a box and then you can see it 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.060
 example I have a house that was over 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.000
 of a tree and then I was expanding it 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.149
 according to what the state but this 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.399
 it's pretty good for when you start 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.680
 you need a lot of wood but you could 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.250
 solve it by simply putting poles 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.130
 of wood and already 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.810
 and this remove it through you this 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.560
 remove this and this and already with the other's 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.900
 wood and like that but really 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.570
 so using the truth looks pretty good 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.160
 it's not very big but it's a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.880
 construction that I like quite 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.330
 is that I like this to me 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.590
 like quite a favorite in fact and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.060
 watching from the lookout 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 I say goodbye to God
