00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
guess if I'd any third of a yard for the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.609 
guess if I'd any third of a yard for the
top<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.189> third<00:02:01.369> of<00:02:01.399> a<00:02:01.549> yard<00:02:01.789> for<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.209> lining

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.819 
top and a third of a yard for the lining
but<00:02:03.619> actually<00:02:04.579> that<00:02:05.509> amount<00:02:06.109> of<00:02:06.259> fabric<00:02:06.439> will

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
but actually that amount of fabric will

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.380 
but actually that amount of fabric will
make<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.130> two<00:02:07.340> tops<00:02:09.640> cut<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.970> neckline

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
will put these pieces right sides

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:06.660 
will put these pieces right sides
together<00:03:51.790> matching<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:01.569> seams<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.250> now<00:04:06.430> we're

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
together matching the seams so now we're

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.179
