00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pretty shimmery fabric and then it's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
pretty shimmery fabric and then it's
just<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> SAT<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.360> looking<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
just you know kind of SAT me looking and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
just you know kind of SAT me looking and
then<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> short<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> may<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:20.970> too

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
then it's short I think it may be too

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.560 
then it's short I think it may be too
short<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.229> only<00:01:22.560> 4<00:01:23.040> 11<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.030> even<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.390> me

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
short now I'm only 4 11 but even with me

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
short now I'm only 4 11 but even with me
being<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.229> short<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.799> still<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
being that's short I still think the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789 
being that's short I still think the
skirt<00:01:26.790> maybe<00:01:26.939> too<00:01:27.210> short<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.689> me<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
skirt maybe too short for me so if I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.060 
skirt maybe too short for me so if I
love<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:33.170> start<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> website<00:01:34.799> thought

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
love it start on the website thought

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.260
