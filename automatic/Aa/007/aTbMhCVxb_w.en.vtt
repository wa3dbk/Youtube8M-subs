now<00:01:11.189> there's<00:01:11.400> another<00:01:11.640> place<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> Leibniz

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
now there's another place in Leibniz

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
now there's another place in Leibniz
where<00:01:13.439> he<00:01:13.650> talks<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:13.979> principles<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
where he talks about principles of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.240 
where he talks about principles of
nature<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> grace<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> he<00:01:16.650> asks<00:01:16.950> why<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
nature and grace and he asks why is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.530 
nature and grace and he asks why is
there<00:01:17.610> something<00:01:17.880> rather<00:01:18.240> than<00:01:18.420> nothing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
there something rather than nothing

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410 
there something rather than nothing
which<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.640> has<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.880> connection<00:01:21.299> perhaps

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
which is has some connection perhaps

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
which is has some connection perhaps
with<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.689> question<00:01:22.110> why<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.650> there

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with your question why is there

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
with your question why is there
something<00:01:23.100> rather<00:01:23.369> than<00:01:23.549> nothing<00:01:23.810> because

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
something rather than nothing because

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440 
something rather than nothing because
nothing<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.830> simpler<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> easier<00:01:27.180> than

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
nothing is simpler and easier than

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
nothing is simpler and easier than
something<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:29.159> find<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.700> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
something and I find this to be very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
something and I find this to be very
interesting<00:01:31.880> because<00:01:34.070> because<00:01:35.070> Leibniz<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
interesting because because Leibniz is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.810 
interesting because because Leibniz is
talking<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:35.939> complexity<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.610> he

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
talking about complexity and in and he

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
talking about complexity and in and he
says<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> universe<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.869> something<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
says the universe with something in it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
says the universe with something in it
is<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.829> complicated<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.729> empty

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is more complicated than an empty

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.510 
is more complicated than an empty
universe<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.890> he's<00:01:44.040> asking<00:01:44.189> where

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
universe and I think he's asking where

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
universe and I think he's asking where
is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> complexity<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.329> from<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
is the complexity come from and this is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
is the complexity come from and this is
a<00:01:46.380> question<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.860> modern<00:01:47.579> physicists<00:01:48.030> are

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
a question that modern physicists are

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.289 
a question that modern physicists are
interested<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.710> Leibniz<00:01:50.430> his<00:01:50.579> answer<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
interested in and Leibniz his answer is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260 
interested in and Leibniz his answer is
a<00:01:51.329> funny<00:01:51.659> answer<00:01:51.840> he<00:01:52.079> says<00:01:52.290> God<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
a funny answer he says God is the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.289 
a funny answer he says God is the
complexity<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.040> now<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> way

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
complexity well so now actually in a way

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.580 
complexity well so now actually in a way
that's<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.630> saying<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> laws<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.409> physics

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that's like saying the laws of physics

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
that's like saying the laws of physics
and<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.759> initial<00:02:00.090> conditions<00:02:00.509> provide<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and the initial conditions provide the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.609 
and the initial conditions provide the
complexity<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> universe<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:04.290> initial

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
complexity of the universe the initial

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
complexity of the universe the initial
complexity<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> initial<00:02:05.939> conditions

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
complexity and if the initial conditions

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
complexity and if the initial conditions
are<00:02:06.540> simple<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.140> an<00:02:07.259> empty<00:02:07.500> universe<00:02:07.740> or

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
are simple like an empty universe or

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.369 
are simple like an empty universe or
singularity<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.450> all<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> complexity

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
singularity then all the complexity

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.570 
singularity then all the complexity
inject<00:02:10.770> into<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> universities<00:02:11.400> by<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
inject into the universities by the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.030 
inject into the universities by the
choice<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> laws<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> physics

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
choice of the laws of physics

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
choice of the laws of physics
so<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.360> question<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.690> where<00:02:15.840> does<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.050> come

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so so the question is where does it come

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.120 
so so the question is where does it come
from<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.400> guess<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:17.970> liveness<00:02:19.130> view

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
from and I guess in a way liveness view

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.820 
from and I guess in a way liveness view
of<00:02:20.250> God<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:20.880> abstract<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.720> he's<00:02:22.470> really

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
of God is very abstract and he's really

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.140 
of God is very abstract and he's really
saying<00:02:23.010> maybe<00:02:23.220> God<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> laws<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.030> nature

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
saying maybe God is the laws of nature

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.550 
saying maybe God is the laws of nature
or<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> initial<00:02:25.050> complexity<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.470> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
very interesting and that's why I think

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.740 
not a physics book but if quantum
mechanics<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.890> correct<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.940> he's<00:03:48.090> wrong<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
mechanics is correct then he's wrong and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.740 
mechanics is correct then he's wrong and
there<00:03:49.290> really<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.650> real<00:03:49.860> randomness<00:03:53.540> ok<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
there really is real randomness ok I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.090 
there really is real randomness ok I
don't<00:03:55.019> know<00:03:55.080> if<00:03:55.200> there<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.470> any<00:03:55.620> more<00:03:55.739> question

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
don't know if there is any more question

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.850 
don't know if there is any more question
because<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.390> question<00:03:57.720> right<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.350> think

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
because I have a question right I think

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.190 
because I have a question right I think
I<00:03:59.250> believe<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.580> wrote<00:03:59.850> somewhere<00:04:00.330> oh<00:04:00.720> my<00:04:01.019> god

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
I believe you wrote somewhere oh my god

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.890 
I believe you wrote somewhere oh my god
yeah<00:04:02.040> someone<00:04:02.430> called<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.940> Triton<00:04:03.390> number

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
yeah someone called it the Triton number

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.060 
yeah someone called it the Triton number
is<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.170> right<00:04:04.410> yes<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.760> question<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.150> do

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
is that right yes the question is do

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.490 
is that right yes the question is do
this<00:04:08.070> for<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:09.750> number<00:04:10.019> exists<00:04:12.380> yes<00:04:13.380> or

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
this for you that number exists yes or

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
this for you that number exists yes or
no<00:04:13.650> well<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> problem

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
no well that's the problem

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.210 
no well that's the problem
because<00:04:15.900> by<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.290> all<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> arguments<00:04:16.950> I've

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
because by the all the arguments I've

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.740 
because by the all the arguments I've
been<00:04:17.370> giving<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.700> up<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.940> now<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.450> just

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
been giving you up to now have just

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.849 
been giving you up to now have just
damned<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.320> not<00:04:19.500> exist

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
damned to not exist

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.420 
damned to not exist
since<00:04:20.069> you<00:04:20.759> know<00:04:20.849> my<00:04:21.299> my<00:04:22.109> best<00:04:22.409> theorem<00:04:22.919> which

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
since you know my my best theorem which

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.520 
since you know my my best theorem which
has<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.699> do<00:04:23.819> with<00:04:23.939> that<00:04:24.090> Omega<00:04:24.240> number<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.349> I've

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
has to do with that Omega number so I've

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.110 
has to do with that Omega number so I've
just<00:04:25.560> eliminated<00:04:26.310> all<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.819> work<00:04:26.969> in

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
just eliminated all of the work in

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.779 
just eliminated all of the work in
mathematics<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:27.719> did<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.469> it's<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.949> problem<00:04:29.400> but

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
mathematics I did so it's a problem but

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.700 
mathematics I did so it's a problem but
uh<00:04:29.849> now<00:04:30.689> I<00:04:30.719> think<00:04:31.139> what's<00:04:31.259> interesting<00:04:31.379> about

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
uh now I think what's interesting about

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.969 
uh now I think what's interesting about
Omega<00:04:32.219> is<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.849> almost<00:04:33.060> exists<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.830> has<00:04:34.889> a

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
Omega is that it almost exists it has a

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.920 
Omega is that it almost exists it has a
simple<00:04:35.400> definition<00:04:35.550> as<00:04:36.509> a<00:04:36.569> holding

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
simple definition as a holding

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.450 
simple definition as a holding
probability<00:04:37.969> but<00:04:38.969> it<00:04:39.330> escapes<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.919> power<00:04:41.129> of

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
probability but it escapes the power of

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.070 
probability but it escapes the power of
proof<00:04:41.759> in<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.180> bad<00:04:42.389> way<00:04:42.599> that<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.810> told<00:04:43.020> you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
proof in this bad way that I told you

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.749 
proof in this bad way that I told you
you<00:04:43.169> can't<00:04:43.379> prove<00:04:43.530> what<00:04:43.650> its<00:04:43.800> bits<00:04:43.979> are<00:04:44.159> in<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
you can't prove what its bits are in the

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.730 
you can't prove what its bits are in the
very<00:04:44.909> bad<00:04:45.210> way<00:04:45.389> but<00:04:45.990> let<00:04:46.139> me<00:04:46.229> tell<00:04:46.409> you<00:04:46.530> why

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
very bad way but let me tell you why

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.279 
very bad way but let me tell you why
Omega<00:04:47.159> is<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:48.000> more<00:04:48.360> real<00:04:48.689> than<00:04:49.080> maybe

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
Omega is a little more real than maybe

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.760 
Omega is a little more real than maybe
most<00:04:49.740> real<00:04:50.069> numbers<00:04:50.629> you<00:04:51.629> see<00:04:52.229> most<00:04:52.590> real

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
most real numbers you see most real

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.460 
most real numbers you see most real
numbers<00:04:53.069> I<00:04:53.159> can't<00:04:53.370> even
