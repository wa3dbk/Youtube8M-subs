 this Christmas 2014 that attracts more and more 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.260
 the malicious ones we will also talk about the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.809
 movie of michael mann 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.460
 himalaya 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.900
 we were talking to you there are some 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.120
 weeks of this size leak having 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.920
 targeted the group sony pictures the giant of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.750
 cinema had been hacked an important 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.400
 servers offer hackers something 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 get hold of the entirety the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.940
 secrets of the firm of these forward advisories 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.130
 for example on some stars like 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.239
 angelina pretty only this type of 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.980
 data leak is not a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.330
 epiphenomenon she even tends to 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.800
 become a bad story in the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 web is overflowing with these data leaks 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560
 undermining the privacy of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.110
 Internet users 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 an example of the two examples even of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560
 information she was not able to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.030
 discover and this to make correct 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.520
 beggar the last case to date after by 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.490
 example of peace the statements of a 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 dentist's office or even 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.770
 hippopotamus restaurants 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 in the first case cops and 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 restaurants and card 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.509
 banking fortunately unusable but 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.399
 also many customer mails 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.929
 dissatisfied identities postal addresses 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.580
 messages against bad 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.619
 service to institutions that do not have 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.000
 been appreciated all this was available at 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.740
 from a simple browser 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 imagine a little bit the problem 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.819
 the other problem was a website 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.590
 which displays and a third party https there 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.270
 explained to have secure hosting 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.250
 except that I had access to the identity 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.380
 the amount to the postal addresses of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.490
 many dentist surgeon who 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.190
 thought to make the telly statement 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.890
 everything secure brief everything has been fixed 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.300
 but no customer has been informed of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.849
 side of our digital devices is not going 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.560
 not much better either with 583 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.819
 millions of android devices sold 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.690
 in the first six months of the year 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.209
 2014 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.259
 the google system is a target of 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.950
 more and more interesting for the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.740
 cybercriminals 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.750
 so these pixels 151000 software 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.209
 malicious a few listed g data 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.140
 imagine 12% more compared to 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.569
 previous semester 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.489
 in short beware you update your 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.780
 software but unfortunately near 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.910
 70% of android devices 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.700
 in circulation are equipped with a system 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.550
 obsolete data from November 2014 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.959
 in short be careful we will talk to 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.819
 cinema now with the next 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.080
 production signed michael mann on him 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.480
 owes to the two cops in Miami 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.340
 or still collateral in March 2015 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.140
 universal will propose a story of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.000
 hackers baptized gentleman 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.950

 help the fbi yahia counter a mysterious 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.330
 hacker is attacking 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.550
 the world economy brief it looks like 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.959
 well leap to computer sauce the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.730
 weights the nasty dizziness die to 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.350
 first sight yes the scores tell you 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 no more do we worry about it and 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.160
 Clotilde is called Akers in France and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.360
 the stranger is called black hat 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.400
 with us it's two worlds galls 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.880
 different akers and black hat so 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.660
 pirates 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.410
 normally these are not the friends of the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.330
 shopping connect or no longer control anything 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.319
 I can hit who I want what I 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.280
 want where I want 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.280
 they transfer the money 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.390
 no imprint no trace no 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.390
 pity 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.840
 what do we know about this guy 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.520
 the cyber criminals damaged a 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.120
 reactor in Taiwan that's all we 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.860
 know to catch it we will need 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.980
 of a hacker a black hat of a wave 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.300
 hathaway is a genius programmer 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.180
 you want my help then you commuted 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.530
 pain without me and with an attack 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.800

 yeah bah me if that's the code this 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.430
 portion there seems incomplete he's getting 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.050
 to describe 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.430
 but for what purpose these types of doing 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.090
 to disappear a city and he will not hesitate 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.290
 not a second 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.290

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.770
 china is now chicago this is 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.720

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.550
 political act terrorist claim 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.180
 no claim no statement 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 is he wants 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.740
 it's not about money it's not about 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.860
 policy 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.510
 for you it's just a game 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.800
 a virtual world 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.800
 you've never been able to get into the game 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.940

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.700
 all that is what made me protect 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.030
 illac and the sites of the msa and the 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.290

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.940
 must flee I will put it out of order 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.360
 to harm 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.650
 this guy is dangerous 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.330
 all this is to get close enough 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.530
 night and quickly 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.530
 a control nothing 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.340

 of projo on the excellent far cry 4 of 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.400
 at ubisoft 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.900
 careful if you go dizzy 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.570
 your way you wander in 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.830
 the scale of the himalayas is just trying to 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.050

 dictatorship of admin pass then the 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.530
 scenario is concrete and atmosphere at 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.360
 cleat for this first-person shooter 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.670
 no one has anything for him to spend the winter 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.470
 with a huge cloak in this world 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.240
 open that you can discover solo 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.310
 or in cooperation mode 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.110
 it's just a little suri videogame 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.760
 I highly recommend - if 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.410
