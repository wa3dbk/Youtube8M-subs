and<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:11.130> suspect<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.220> there's<00:01:12.520> I'll<00:01:13.450> back<00:01:13.720> up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
and I suspect that there's I'll back up

and I suspect that there's I'll back up
a<00:01:13.990> little<00:01:14.079> bit<00:01:14.290> there's<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.860> think<00:01:15.310> similarity

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
a little bit there's I think similarity

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.539 
a little bit there's I think similarity
between<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.689> sassafras<00:01:17.110> notes<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:18.009> I<00:01:18.040> tend

between the sassafras notes that I tend

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.999 
between the sassafras notes that I tend
to<00:01:18.640> see<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.149> Sonoma<00:01:19.929> Coast<00:01:20.079> wines<00:01:20.409> more<00:01:20.679> often

to see in Sonoma Coast wines more often

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.149

Valley<00:01:25.710> wines<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:27.039> think<00:01:27.249> they're<00:01:27.429> they're

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
Valley wines I think they're they're

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.249 
Valley wines I think they're they're
coming<00:01:27.999> probably<00:01:28.450> from<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.719> similar<00:01:28.990> place

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259

there's<00:01:29.979> there<00:01:30.280> some<00:01:30.460> overlap<00:01:30.850> there<00:01:30.880> but<00:01:31.749> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
there's there some overlap there but the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.330 
there's there some overlap there but the
difference<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.319> you<00:01:32.469> have<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.920> do<00:01:33.039> more<00:01:33.219> with

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
difference is you have to do more with

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.219 
difference is you have to do more with
perhaps<00:01:33.729> nighttime<00:01:34.240> temperatures<00:01:34.749> so<00:01:35.200> that

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
perhaps nighttime temperatures so that

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.080 
perhaps nighttime temperatures so that
the<00:01:35.469> cooler<00:01:35.710> during<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.310> growing<00:01:36.490> season<00:01:36.609> and

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
ripening part of this season the cooler

the nighttime temperatures the more

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.539 
the nighttime temperatures the more
you'll<00:01:40.600> get<00:01:40.840> those<00:01:41.409> things<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.219> express

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
you'll get those things to to express

you'll get those things to to express

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.719 
River Valley because it tends to have
more<00:02:05.170> alluvial<00:02:05.770> soils<00:02:06.219> which<00:02:06.429> would<00:02:06.579> be<00:02:06.700> a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
more alluvial soils which would be a

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.120 
more alluvial soils which would be a
little<00:02:06.969> more<00:02:07.090> homogeneous<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:08.619> opposed<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
little more homogeneous as opposed to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.410 
little more homogeneous as opposed to
right<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.580> coast<00:02:09.789> where<00:02:10.000> we've<00:02:10.149> got<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
right on the coast where we've got the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.970 
right on the coast where we've got the
San<00:02:10.599> Andreas<00:02:10.750> Fault<00:02:10.959> stumbling<00:02:11.709> all<00:02:11.830> these

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
San Andreas Fault stumbling all these

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.530 
San Andreas Fault stumbling all these
different<00:02:12.250> soil<00:02:12.490> types<00:02:12.550> together<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.390> think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
different soil types together so I think

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.290 
different soil types together so I think
there's<00:02:13.810> more<00:02:13.990> radical<00:02:14.410> differences<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
there's more radical differences of the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.940 
there's more radical differences of the
closer<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> fault<00:02:17.080> at<00:02:17.290> least<00:02:17.470> which<00:02:17.740> would

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
closer to the fault at least which would

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.850 
closer to the fault at least which would
tend<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> be<00:02:18.459> more<00:02:18.490> toward<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.620> income

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
tend to be more toward the income

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.000 
tend to be more toward the income
the<00:02:21.180> cinema<00:02:22.180> coasts<00:02:22.360> Appalachian<00:02:22.990> wine<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:23.980> we

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the cinema coasts Appalachian wine so we

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.480 
the cinema coasts Appalachian wine so we
sender<00:02:24.370> my<00:02:24.850> effective<00:02:26.550> definition<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.670> so

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490

that's<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.940> good<00:02:31.720> question<00:02:31.990> because

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that's a really good question because

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.350 
that's a really good question because
the<00:02:32.680> appellation<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.460> rather<00:02:33.640> large<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.330> I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the appellation is rather large and I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.260 
the appellation is rather large and I
think<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.690> has<00:02:34.840> different<00:02:35.110> characteristics

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
think it has different characteristics

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.390 
think it has different characteristics
depending<00:02:37.270> on<00:02:37.390> which<00:02:37.740> corners<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:39.010> which<00:02:39.160> soil

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
depending on which corners in which soil

just say one thing I would say you know

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.630 
just say one thing I would say you know
look<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.880> black<00:02:45.880> cherry<00:02:46.180> cola<00:02:46.450> notes<00:02:47.110> and
