both punches being on top and both kicks
being<00:00:22.419> on<00:00:22.509> bottom<00:00:22.750> wasn't<00:00:23.710> an<00:00:23.770> issue<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.010 

first<00:00:38.250> way<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> gaining<00:00:38.760> meter<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> are

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
first way of gaining meter is if you are

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
first way of gaining meter is if you are
attacking<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.680> player<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.220> blocking<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
attacking a player that is blocking so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119

you gain meter by dealing chip damage

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
you gain meter by dealing chip damage
it's<00:00:44.699> a<00:00:44.850> way<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> punishing<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.989> overly

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's a way of punishing the overly

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
it's a way of punishing the overly
defensive<00:00:46.500> player<00:00:47.010> another<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.059> gain

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
defensive player another way you gain

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.509 
defensive player another way you gain
meter<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.739> blocking<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
meter is when you are not blocking and

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.970 
meter is when you are not blocking and
getting<00:00:50.790> attacked<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.720> by<00:00:51.870> taking<00:00:52.110> damage<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
getting attacked so by taking damage you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.640 
getting attacked so by taking damage you
gain<00:00:53.190> meter<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.449> same<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.989> however<00:00:55.230> the

in<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.480> final<00:06:45.810> build<00:06:46.020> however<00:06:46.860> there<00:06:47.580> was<00:06:47.670> one

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
in the final build however there was one

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.580 
in the final build however there was one
thing<00:06:48.150> with<00:06:48.360> sub-zero<00:06:48.600> that<00:06:49.050> I<00:06:49.080> didn't<00:06:49.380> like

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
pressure on his foe and traps them there

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.610 
pressure on his foe and traps them there
he<00:06:56.490> can<00:06:56.640> also<00:06:56.820> throw<00:06:57.390> his<00:06:57.600> fall<00:06:57.840> into<00:06:58.260> a<00:06:58.290> clone

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620
