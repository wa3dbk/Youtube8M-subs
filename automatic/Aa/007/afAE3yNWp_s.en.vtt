00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hi everybody, I'm a professional beginning 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.910
 About Us | 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 Let's remember three basic rules of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 power of integers 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.010
 here I have a nanny has number two and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.740
 led to occupy base2 of exponent 3 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.119
 means that the Spanish indicating the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.529
 amount of times I would multiply 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.390
 base we will then apply the base a two 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 3 times 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 so I 'm going to multiply that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 factor 2 times 2 or 4 4 times two are 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.540
 eight simple beauty rock 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.690
 now there is a little detail here in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.360
 than the negative basis there are two 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 rules of the negative basis which is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 negative lead and have one starting 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.620
 positive negative base 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.920
 high as ink in the result 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 negative, that is, if the base is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.799
 negative spain departure more if the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.140
 base for negative choice tim pana - se 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.619
 the base was positive people 's positive 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.659
 even ok then let's go there let's think 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 with me then let's go 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.970
 - 2 raised to exponent 4 to 4 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.740
 power such as -2 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.650
 once less 2 twice - 23 times 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 least 24 times I would do 2 times two are 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.590
 44 times 16 times 2 2188 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 I did not think I did not need to worry 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.750
 with the signal because high negative base 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.189
 sprint a tea of ​​more what if you are sane 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 Tomé you do - with less gives more and more 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:55.110
 with less gives less than less with less gives 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.119
 more beauty and here negative base of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.850
 Madrid spain ink how much the two I 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:12.200
 I go because at 5 a 2 3 4 and 5 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:16.280
 Let's go there 2 times 2 144 times 2 188 times 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.019
 2 16 sixteen 2 32 did the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 multiplication of shape factors 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.569
 cumulative fact that this characteristic of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.450
 power base negative lead sporting 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.849
 for less 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.090
 Okay, ah, I'm Sao Tome. 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:36.110
 So make an emotional game work on the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.290
 agency and client that is without 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.750
 less gives more more with less gives less - 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.319
 with less gives more and more with less gives 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.530
 less beauty there is one little detail 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.739
 rule that it is important that 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.670
 when the signal was negative here 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.579
 out 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.450
 no relatives here are inside the 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.569
 relative 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 this here is nothing other is a one 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.329
 gotcha right because it is the least who I 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.069
 I will multiply when I have not 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.680
 within the pair in means that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.630
 are multiplying the number by base and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 sign four times so I put 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.500
 at least 24 times 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 here is not asking here to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.750
 multiply as during cumulatively 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.090
 only 12 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.540
 so I put it on - profonics and stayed two 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 months two months two that is the same 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.319
 result from above is not going to give eight only 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.760
 that eight negative because the signal is 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.349
 keep different from this here 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.200
 difference because it is within the country 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.030
 here in personal beauty 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.239
 these are the rules is the rule the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.040
 the basic rules of power and people 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.609
 commenting on other videos will other 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.359
 rules 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.359
 A hug for everyone
