00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 yes, here today I show you how to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 Windows passwords are scarce because of the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.870
 forgot or from another 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.540
 reason on a windows basis too 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.730
 you had to grab for it you go up 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.600
 following website on meeting point 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 sourceforge.net and invite you here 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:32.130
 of track live cd round then you get 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 this file is an iso-file and if 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.129
 you need something to burn then 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 can you take the program here cd 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 burner can be found on the page cd 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 burner xp point se / you can too 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 download for free and then you do 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 Next you do the cd player 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 program on created iso-image goes 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.229
 on browse goes to the directory 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.500
 where crack on live-cd so deposited 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.619
 here we have 600 megabytes 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 take it makes medium burn and then 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.170
 do you have a bookable live cd and how 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.650
 the whole works then I show 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 right now I just know 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 that I created here in the test password 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.049
 we have and we make it our own 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 change Password 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:38.579
 current password protest and mine 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 new is test 1 repeats s1 none 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.740
 notes 1 know the change 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:55.159
 test 1 test 1 well know the children's village 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 test once and now I have to, of course 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.020
 unfortunately off screen go to normal 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.619
 outdoor camera because I have the device 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.149
 is practically of the good ones 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.739
 he sets the cd new calculator in principle 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.970
 a fat calculator high depending on the calculator 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.670
 come you need to boot asus 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.069
 I 'll come to the notebook that fits 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.709
 is retaining, depending on the type of calculation 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.329
 different if you do not know like you 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.849
 practically the boot order continues in the 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.459
 computer changed gets from the state 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:30.980
 from google just for example 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.780
 samsung good menu including mini move ever 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.250
 After what in the computer have google short 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 will probably be some hotkey 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 find that you bring in the boot mini 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 vividly classic about spears 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.019
 circumstances on order cd 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.970
 then it should work so up 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.150
 right back austria duo welcome 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.190
 calculator has been restarted you could 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.049
 you choose from which drives 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.840
 In this case it was wanted to start 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.940
 here live part blu ray drive 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 lay 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.570
 program instead of here comes a selection 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.150
 screen image program start more 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.210
 we wanted to have the automatic up 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.800
 mode we recommend an automatic 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.410
 screen resolution automatic 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.760
 keyboard American though that is 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.320
 not a big problem we can as well 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.080
 the switch to German when he 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.160
 each one comes with special signs and 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.200
 can also change the screen resolution 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.000
 to adjust 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.980
 Graphic monographic mode for computer 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.110
 with little memory and still in 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.450
 pure text bures but simplicity 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.630
 Half we just take that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.250
 Automatic mode of the standard too 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.080
 if he chooses nothing in the screen 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.430
 automatically after about ten seconds 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.990
 by shock 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.610
 then the whole thing goes first 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.970
 Hardware detection of the last one took a short time 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.970
 moment 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.659
 you can all the way on 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.969
 install a usb stick 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.920
 however, it is a simple one 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.870
 just a usb enabled 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.969
 bootable usb-stick to generate this 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.379
 buy games work at the 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.689
 program because not that with it now 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.579
 I've already tried a way 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.989
 Found how it works and will 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.329
 probably also a tutorial 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.329
 do 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.060
 but as long as could at least times with c 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.639
 d able computer new passwords 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.120
 reset or crack or something 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.270
 wanted to join stood the hardware 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.270
 recognition 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.599
 there you do not have to do anything just run 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.599
 to let 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.660
 so combined to the home screen you 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.320
 just have to enter now 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.400
 what is here in the ran colon 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.640
 now a picture difficult for me because 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.360
 So I have to pass the camera 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.160
 forgive me if I ever 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.710
 maybe I tried a mistake 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.270
 hinzubekommen 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.340
 so on crack now comes hyphen 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.140
 and at the wind have paid attention to it 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:39.130
 American keyboard that is in the 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:39.130
 case a sharp point sh dialog 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.120
 as for the short preaches but how 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.580
 somehow said past the camera 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.630
 Type and blind rhine was then double 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.350
 difficult because we enter something there 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.419
 is like me three times wrong and at 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.070
 the hyphen just a sharp s 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.460
 then press also gets a stroke 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.250
 have on the American keyboard so 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.160
 we have different choices in the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.930
 principle go to the link above normal 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:22.169
 that's enough for the normal windows 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:24.600
 Passwords and then we start here 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:29.910
 above already two empty passwords 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.889
 once found guest once and breathe 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.750
 Now the password is here 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.229
 specially created you know that 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.539
 was test 1b great extra yesterday because 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.449
 I participated the first night last night 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:47.430
 have taken and now this morning 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:49.620
 in the second part of video but it always 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.990
 still the password test 1 and that will 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.080
 probably all of them now 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:58.440
 find a chance 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.780
 a short moment when it takes too long 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.060
 I just blow up a bit like that 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.400
 I miss it after four minutes and 17 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.400
 seconds had the password test 1 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.210
 found and then it continues to spark 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.760
 apparently two others are watching 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.740
 no idea but in any case was 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.860
 the password for my account became 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.050
 found and I think it's easy 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.909
 turn on computer normally you go 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.430
 quarterly and looks little logged in 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:28.430
 It was good in that sense
