sponge it helps you get better results

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
sponge it helps you get better results
and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.979> start<00:01:20.189> painting<00:01:20.700> your

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and then you just start painting your

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
and then you just start painting your
colors<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.140> didn't

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
colors on and as you can see I didn't

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.640 
colors on and as you can see I didn't
clean<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.740> my<00:01:29.630> nail<00:01:30.630> polish<00:01:31.079> because<00:01:31.290> I'm

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
clean up my nail polish because I'm

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.300 
clean up my nail polish because I'm
gonna<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.189> making<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> huge<00:01:32.790> mess<00:01:33.000> anyway<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> he

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
gonna be making a huge mess anyway so he

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.370 
gonna be making a huge mess anyway so he
clean<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.909> end

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.310 

these<00:01:46.040> two<00:01:46.729> colors<00:01:47.149> are<00:01:47.180> almost<00:01:47.719> at<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> end

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
these two colors are almost at the end

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.469 
these two colors are almost at the end
so<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.219> a<00:01:49.310> little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.909> harder<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.210> get<00:01:50.420> them

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
so it's a little bit harder to get them

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:00.160 
so it's a little bit harder to get them
especially<00:01:53.479> my<00:01:53.780> alpine<00:01:54.259> snow

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.710 

you<00:02:00.830> kind<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.159> just<00:02:01.220> want<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.610> overlap<00:02:02.210> some<00:02:02.570> of

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
you kind of just want to overlap some of

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.140 
you kind of just want to overlap some of
it<00:02:02.900> as<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.290> can<00:02:03.320> see<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:03.950> did<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.909> know<00:02:05.030> it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
it as you can see that I did you know it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.580 
it as you can see that I did you know it
seems<00:02:05.330> kind<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.630> pointless<00:02:05.810> putting<00:02:06.380> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
seems kind of pointless putting the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.130 
seems kind of pointless putting the
white<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.130> sponge<00:02:07.340> too<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.840> helps

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
white on the sponge too but just helps

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.870 
white on the sponge too but just helps
blend<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> little<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.979> better<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.640> what

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
blend it a little bit better so what

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.130 
blend it a little bit better so what
you're<00:02:11.030> gonna<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.739> fuzz<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:12.920> my<00:02:13.040> nail<00:02:14.140> just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
you're gonna do fuzz on my nail just

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.780 
you're gonna do fuzz on my nail just
kind<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:16.300> start<00:02:17.300> sponging<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
kind of start sponging it on so I just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.340 
kind of start sponging it on so I just
kind<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.060> place<00:02:20.300> my<00:02:20.510> colors<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.170> that's

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
kind of place my colors see if that's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.900 
kind of place my colors see if that's
how<00:02:21.500> thick<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.890> want<00:02:22.100> them<00:02:22.959> mm<00:02:27.550> should<00:02:28.550> get<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
how thick I want them mm should get the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.479 
how thick I want them mm should get the
white<00:02:30.190> covered<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.209> sides<00:02:33.430> okay<00:02:34.430> so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's just kind of where I want it and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:47.980 
that's just kind of where I want it and
then<00:02:36.769> you're<00:02:37.100> gonna<00:02:37.250> do<00:02:37.900> step<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.049> over<00:02:39.260> again

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:03:12.030 

kind<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.830> overlap

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.510 

okay

okay

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.870 
okay
damn<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.990> again

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.390 

you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.870> start<00:03:23.170> kind<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.449 

moving<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.269> slightly<00:03:28.480> when<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.110> up<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.340> down

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
moving it slightly when you up and down

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.289 
moving it slightly when you up and down
so<00:03:30.879> that<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.620> starts<00:03:32.620> blending<00:03:36.000> get<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.090> few

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
so that it starts blending get a few

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.059 
so that it starts blending get a few
litres<00:03:37.599> now<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.470> first<00:03:38.680> time<00:03:38.890> I've

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
litres now this is the first time I've

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.809 
litres now this is the first time I've
done<00:03:39.280> each<00:03:39.580> nail<00:03:39.909> individually<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:42.370> every

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
layer done until I moved on and I found

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:59.670 
layer done until I moved on and I found
I<00:03:45.370> got<00:03:45.519> better<00:03:45.700> results

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
that while it's still wet you take a

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.909 
that while it's still wet you take a
good<00:05:28.840> amount<00:05:29.319> of<00:05:29.560> your<00:05:30.719> top<00:05:31.719> coat<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:32.319> that
