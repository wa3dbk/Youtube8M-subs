 previous context we could see one 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.650
 column that exceeds 200 meters of 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 height that could not be controlled and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.770

 pay some kind of special attention 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.130
 to this sinister that is not yet 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.840

 quilicura police station has stock of 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.530
 industrial material I was asking 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 him regarding some comment that we 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.769
 had made neighbors of this place in 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.380
 how much there had been a 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.510
 control of the health sector 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.459
 warning that the collection here was 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.480
 it was a situation that was 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.340
 investigating and that he was taking 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 forward on the part of the authorities in 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.810
 as to the lifting of these 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.379
 waste something that clearly did not happen 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 and that fumaric acid, as the 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.870
 Lieutenant is the cause of this column 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 what are you seeing through the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.159
 Take direct example that will host millo 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.879
 a column of black smoke that although it is 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.140
 quite quite a loan does not have 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.579
 less what we when we wanted 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.569
 cancel any type of effect 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.730
 secondary when breathing or at the moment 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.560
 to be able to talk we have not had any kind 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.060
 of problem in that sense but that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.220
 as well 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.739
 we are with normality 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.290
 doing our work two 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.959
 Volunteer firefighters have resulted 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.190
 with problems one with an intoxication 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.380
 are out of danger and others with a 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.890
 wound on one of his feet but 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.560
 important still can not be stifled 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.480
 this fire by mainly what 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.670
 I told you about problems with the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.380
 water supply to trucks 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.169
 aljibes you will know you are made 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.639
 insufficient in these situations is going 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.280
 very fast the water in ten minutes already 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.350
 they are absolutely empty that's why 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.000
 that the fireman's body that the priest 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 I was already managing the avenue until 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.760
 this place a height monitor that 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.990
 could freshen up the place what is it 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.250

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.880
 Carlos can not show there is the 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.889
 monitor which I am talking about 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.320

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.210
 can you see the image is that 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.910
 monitor who is doing the work 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.400
 to freshen the place so I could 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.740
 subsequently operate there and finally 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.249
 and extinguish the flames that so far 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.859
 continue to consume is

 was happening in this place now it's 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.229

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:31.829

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.249
 key work regarding what you can 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.379
