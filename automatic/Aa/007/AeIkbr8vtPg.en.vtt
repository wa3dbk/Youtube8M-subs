okay<00:00:00.960> here's<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.790> different<00:00:02.790> LED<00:00:03.389> mod<00:00:03.629> from<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay here's a different LED mod from the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay here's a different LED mod from the
top<00:00:04.170> loader<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:05.220> customer<00:00:06.180> scott<00:00:07.309> wanted<00:00:08.309> this

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
top loader a customer scott wanted this

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.089 
top loader a customer scott wanted this
and<00:00:08.790> i<00:00:09.570> think<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.200> looks<00:00:10.349> pretty<00:00:10.410> good<00:00:10.800> what

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and i think it looks pretty good what

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.150 
and i think it looks pretty good what
he's<00:00:11.630> asked<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> blue<00:00:13.320> LED<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.889> shine

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
he's asked for is a blue LED to shine

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.029 
he's asked for is a blue LED to shine
through<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.849> vents<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.830> bottom<00:00:16.830> side

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
through the vents on the bottom side

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.599 
through the vents on the bottom side
here<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:19.590> give<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.800> blue<00:00:20.189> glow<00:00:20.520> effect

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
here to give it that blue glow effect

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:30.859 
here to give it that blue glow effect
okay<00:00:26.900> basically<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:27.930> I've<00:00:28.230> done<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:29.869> rammed

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
okay basically all I've done is rammed

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.080 
okay basically all I've done is rammed
power<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.470> LED<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.079> then<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:35.190> resistor<00:00:36.649> from

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
power to LED and then the resistor from

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.500 
power to LED and then the resistor from
cathode<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.430> soldered<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
cathode and then it's soldered right to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.880 
cathode and then it's soldered right to
the<00:00:42.629> ground<00:00:42.780> plane<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.410> there<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:45.770> get<00:00:46.770> some

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the ground plane right there I get some

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.369 
the ground plane right there I get some
close-ups<00:00:47.100> later<00:00:47.539> I'm<00:00:48.539> trying<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> play

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
close-ups later I'm trying to play

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.430 
close-ups later I'm trying to play
around<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> positioning<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.520> LED

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
around with the positioning of the LED

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.500 
around with the positioning of the LED
and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.739> what<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.940> if

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and I think what I really like is if if

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
and I think what I really like is if if
I<00:00:54.660> could<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> some<00:00:56.239> kind<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.530> aluminum

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
I could have some kind of like aluminum

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
I could have some kind of like aluminum
tape<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.370> something<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> really

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
tape or something right here to really

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
tape or something right here to really
help<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> shine<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:02.760> shine<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
help it shine through and then shine it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.410 
help it shine through and then shine it
right<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> tape<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.390> looks

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
right at that tape but I think it looks

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.550 
right at that tape but I think it looks
pretty<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.780> since<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.930> not

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pretty good how it is and since I'm not

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.719 
pretty good how it is and since I'm not
going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.890> paid<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.340> money<00:01:11.430> for

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
going to get paid a lot of money for

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.950 
going to get paid a lot of money for
this<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.720> time

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this I'm not going to put a lot of time

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.039 
this I'm not going to put a lot of time
and<00:01:13.080> effort<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> either<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> can

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and effort into it either but you can

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.670 
and effort into it either but you can
definitely<00:01:17.659> see<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> blue<00:01:19.049> light<00:01:19.259> shining

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
definitely see the blue light shining

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
definitely see the blue light shining
through<00:01:19.710> their<00:01:21.500> only<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.590> concern<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:24.200> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
through their only other concern is you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
through their only other concern is you
know<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> vibrate<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.970> start

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
know is it going to vibrate and start

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.429 
know is it going to vibrate and start
breaking<00:01:27.990> legs<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:29.780> should<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> find<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> better

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
breaking legs and should I find a better

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.420 
breaking legs and should I find a better
way<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> mount<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:33.619> maybe<00:01:34.619> even<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.890> hot

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
way to mount it maybe even just hot

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
way to mount it maybe even just hot
glued<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.850> place<00:01:35.880> somehow<00:01:36.509> will<00:01:37.110> take<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> lot

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
glued in place somehow will take a lot

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.190 
glued in place somehow will take a lot
of<00:01:37.619> hot<00:01:37.890> glue<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:41.390> think<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.869> very

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of hot glue I think it's it's very

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710 
of hot glue I think it's it's very
stable<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> know

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
stable as it is but you know

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.450 
stable as it is but you know
happens<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> shipping<00:01:48.890> let's<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.009> close<00:01:50.280> up

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
happens and shipping let's get close up

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.780 
happens and shipping let's get close up
here<00:01:51.950> there<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> looks

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
here there you go that's what it looks

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.660 
here there you go that's what it looks
like<00:01:56.420> step-<00:01:57.740> leg<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> resistor<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
like step- leg of the resistor is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.310 
like step- leg of the resistor is
soldered<00:02:00.149> right<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> ground<00:02:00.719> plane<00:02:01.110> of
