00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.460
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.230
 cryptic one of you asked us a couple 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.760
 tips to betray how to get one 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.070
 Smartphone can save energy 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.930
 Everyone knows the problem the finger 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.220
 they use a lot of energy and energy 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.679
 You have to do the thing almost every day in the 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.910
 dose hang so now I'll show you 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.560
 I 'll give you a little something 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.240
 tell what you can do anything 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.130
 Can you do that first and foremost? 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.919
 you should do the following for a battery 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
 you should then charge it 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.429
 if it is really empty not always 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.079
 constantly plug in the socket otherwise 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.420
 such a battery quickly breaks that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.780
 means completely shut down the battery 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.450
 and then charge overnight and that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.170
 whole in the off state on 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.540
 best then what should you do if 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.360
 You do not necessarily need it in once 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.330
 the settings wlan off wlan 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.590
 It uses a lot of energy 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.120
 is a strong broadcasting power 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.560
 reception performance if you can not do it now 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.410
 you just need it 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.180
 turn off when you're on the road then 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.740
 you usually use the 3g anyway 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.109
 net and there you need that we say 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.420
 simply is not has turned 

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:09.189
 Also safety reasons just as easy 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.659
 wlan from that helps a lot 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.009
 when you're back home and wlan 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.039
 you can switch on here again 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.990
 the second point if such a mobile gps 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.850
 has synonymous gps off synonymous is quite 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.630
 importantly too, that consumes scary 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.479
 much energy 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 You can do that too if you are now 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.749
 not necessarily the whole time in the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.670
 You can also surf the internet 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.990
 Turn off mobile services if you can 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.609
 namely the turn off then it will become 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.469
 the mobile constantly not on the internet 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.899
 and then of course you also save a lot 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.030
 a lot of energy that would be so 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.859
 basic things with a handy what 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.289
 so you can make that can also be a 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.850
 seat rafael is bluetooth if you have it 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.929
 not necessarily that you are right 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.579
 so I have not made again 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.380
 Donated blood does not need it 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.299
 off is also a good thing it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.740
 Also a transmitter receiver consumes 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.959
 energy and not just things 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 Safety is because you can if it is 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.780
 bluetooth is switched on 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.299
 you can easily turn into a foreign 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.009
 device logs in, but so bluetooth 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.880
 if it is not needed necessarily 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.490
 turn off 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.490
 And there is something else in every mobile phone as well 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.720
 this energy saving what you do there 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.619
 For example, that can be a screen 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.239
 goes out faster 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.190
 such stories key lock 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.270
 faster on screen when screen 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.220
 Of course he needs to be faster 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.560
 no energy for lighting so 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.450
 saves energy battery lasts longer 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.239
 So you can loose the the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 battery duration extended by two days 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.390
 if you do not just do all the services 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.709
 I absolutely need it twice if you want to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.150
 she needs you can turn it on 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.310
 but turn off little profit 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.970
 that saves a lot of money 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.100
 we together bluetooth wlan out if 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.110
 you look at ps from gps out of the industry 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.400
 mobile services as I said when you 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.580
 All this just needs 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.400
 hilarious and important would be right now 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.150
 at the beginning with battery to maintain complete 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.209
 the device-shutdown complete 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 turn off and overnight 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.920
 after that, there are so 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.239
 Grundig energy-saving tips for every mobile phone 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 Of course, the attitude is a bit 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.470
 different but in every smartphone there is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.630
 these features like bluetooth gps wlan 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.910
 and mobile services that's all with 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.620
 in it in each cell phone provides so dear 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.200
 Subscribers do not forget us
