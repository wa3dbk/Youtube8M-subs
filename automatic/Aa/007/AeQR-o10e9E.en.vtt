thats<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> wouldn't<00:00:48.719> look<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.989> great

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
great originally just as it is and then

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.090 
great originally just as it is and then

we're actually going to go ahead and do
the<00:00:53.190> pearlescent<00:00:53.489> trick<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.270> way<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.539> can

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the pearlescent trick that way we can

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.090

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
get a little more color in it and we're

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
get a little more color in it and we're
actually<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.430> put<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> hot<00:00:57.120> pink<00:00:57.420> color

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
now you can do the ultra blue because

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
now you can do the ultra blue because
that<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> course<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.510> Tron<00:01:00.780> originally<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that of course what Tron originally is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it's like a blue color but I feel like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's like a blue color but I feel like
it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.660> doesn't<00:01:03.780> stand<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
it just doesn't stand out as much as the
hot<00:01:05.549> pink<00:01:05.820> does<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.479> again<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> paint

and the reason I call it flames is

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.960 
and the reason I call it flames is
because<00:01:29.560> there<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.890> dark<00:01:30.190> color<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.880> then

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
beautiful colors but the end result of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.469

tub<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.470> video<00:02:28.740> I'm<00:02:28.920> we're<00:02:29.160> gonna<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
tub of the video I'm we're gonna do the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.790 
tub of the video I'm we're gonna do the
paint<00:02:29.760> job<00:02:29.970> known<00:02:30.270> as<00:02:30.480> rainbow<00:02:31.080> Tron<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
paint job known as rainbow Tron the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.500 
paint job known as rainbow Tron the
reason<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.070> called<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.120> we're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
reason I called this is because we're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
reason I called this is because we're
mixing<00:02:33.690> one<00:02:34.110> paint<00:02:34.410> job<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:35.070> Tron

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
mixing one paint job that was Tron

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
mixing one paint job that was Tron
originally<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.240> other<00:02:36.720> Tron<00:02:37.200> paint<00:02:37.470> job

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
originally with the other Tron paint job

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.590 
originally with the other Tron paint job
and<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.310> course<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.670> guess<00:02:38.850> rainbows<00:02:39.420> have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
and of course I guess rainbows have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.370 
and of course I guess rainbows have
multiple<00:02:40.050> colors

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
multiple colors

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.260 
multiple colors
whereas<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:40.980> paint<00:02:41.190> tub<00:02:41.340> does<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.760> well<00:02:42.060> my

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
whereas this paint tub does as well my

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.790 
whereas this paint tub does as well my
opinion<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.050> we're<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.560> was<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
opinion so we're going to do was the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.490 
opinion so we're going to do was the
room<00:02:43.920> set<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> primary<00:02:44.490> color<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.780> metallic

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
room set the primary color as a metallic

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.320 
room set the primary color as a metallic
see<00:02:46.950> green<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.580> then<00:02:47.850> we're<00:02:47.940> gonna<00:02:48.030> go<00:02:48.180> ahead

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
see green and then we're gonna go ahead

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.880 
see green and then we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:48.480> put<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> plasma<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.260> top<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
and put the plasma on top of that as a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.730 
and put the plasma on top of that as a
hot<00:02:50.640> pink<00:02:51.060> which<00:02:51.240> makes<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.440> very
