00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
okay here you have it I guess after I

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.299 
okay here you have it I guess after I
had<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.160> two<00:00:05.819> cigarettes<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.629> beer<00:00:07.309> I

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
had about two cigarettes and a beer I

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.110 
had about two cigarettes and a beer I
got<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> motor<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:10.340> not<00:00:11.340> too<00:00:11.490> bad<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.030> went

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
got the motor in not too bad it went

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120 
got the motor in not too bad it went
right<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.500> last<00:00:13.679> time<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.950> did

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
right in this time the last time I did

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
right in this time the last time I did
this<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.519> took<00:00:14.670> me<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:14.940> while<00:00:15.109> because<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
this it took me a little while because I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.760 
this it took me a little while because I
was<00:00:16.350> worried<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.850> chipping<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> paint<00:00:18.770> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
was worried about chipping the paint and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
was worried about chipping the paint and
so<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.279> painted<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> frame<00:00:21.150> black<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.689> time

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
so I painted the frame black this time

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.670 
so I painted the frame black this time
and<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:23.300> got<00:00:24.300> myself<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:24.840> paint<00:00:25.170> marker

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and I got myself a little paint marker

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.089 
and I got myself a little paint marker
and<00:00:26.180> anywhere<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.240> chipped<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.099> actually

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and anywhere I chipped it actually

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
and anywhere I chipped it actually
surprisingly<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.029> only<00:00:30.599> chipped<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.080> about

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
surprisingly I only chipped it in about

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.030 
surprisingly I only chipped it in about
five<00:00:31.590> spots<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.500> doing<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.829> with

five spots you know I'm doing this with
spray<00:00:35.309> paint<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.840> it's<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.079> I'm

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
spray paint so it's not like I'm

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
spray paint so it's not like I'm
spraying<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.860> my<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.610> spray<00:00:38.850> gun<00:00:39.059> or

spraying it with my with my spray gun or
anything<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> not

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
anything like that you know so it's not

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
anything like that you know so it's not
like<00:00:42.149> real<00:00:42.809> good<00:00:42.960> paint<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.620> spray<00:00:44.040> paint

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
like real good paint it's a spray paint
but<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> touched<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> black<00:00:46.230> pen

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
but I touched it up with that black pen
once<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.890> dries<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> can't<00:00:47.430> even<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.120> can't

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
once it dries you can't even you can't

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.350 
once it dries you can't even you can't
even<00:00:48.360> tell<00:00:49.610> I'm<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.760> worried<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
even tell I'm not worried about that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.010 
even tell I'm not worried about that
right<00:00:51.570> now

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
right now

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.160 
right now
maybe<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> future<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.899> like<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> lot

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
maybe in the future if I do like a lot

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
maybe in the future if I do like a lot
of<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> nicer<00:00:56.129> job<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.910> buy<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.809> like

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of like a nicer job on it buy some like

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.529 
of like a nicer job on it buy some like
more<00:00:59.030> performance<00:01:00.030> parts<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> whatnot<00:01:00.960> then

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
more performance parts and whatnot then

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
more performance parts and whatnot then
I'll<00:01:03.539> sandblast<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> frame<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.210> maybe

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I'll sandblast the frame down and maybe

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
I'll sandblast the frame down and maybe
try<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> find<00:01:06.990> somewhere<00:01:07.350> around<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
try and find somewhere around here I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.060 
try and find somewhere around here I
live<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.150> eastern<00:01:09.780> Pennsylvania<00:01:10.070> Northeast

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
live in eastern Pennsylvania Northeast

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.320 
live in eastern Pennsylvania Northeast
Pennsylvania<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.390> hard<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
Pennsylvania so it's hard to find I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
Pennsylvania so it's hard to find I
don't<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.990> anybody<00:01:16.640> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
don't me think there is anybody that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
don't me think there is anybody that
does<00:01:17.820> powder<00:01:18.090> coating<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.830> place

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
does powder coating there is one place

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
does powder coating there is one place
that<00:01:20.100> does<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.060> industrial

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
that does it but they're like industrial

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
that does it but they're like industrial
so<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.930> only<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.200> big<00:01:22.439> stuff<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so they only do big stuff so I don't

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.210 
so they only do big stuff so I don't
think<00:01:24.090> they'll<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> frame<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.799> atv

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
think they'll do a frame you know an atv

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
think they'll do a frame you know an atv
frame<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> motorcycle<00:01:26.880> frame<00:01:27.470> put<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.530> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
frame or a motorcycle frame put it in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
frame or a motorcycle frame put it in
anyway<00:01:29.659> there<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> motors<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.150> only

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
anyway there it is the motors in I only

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
anyway there it is the motors in I only
have<00:01:33.530> two<00:01:34.530> bolts<00:01:35.270> going<00:01:36.270> through<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:38.549> can't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have two bolts going through you can't

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
have two bolts going through you can't
see<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.500> them<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.890> don't

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
see them and I don't have them I don't

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.109 
see them and I don't have them I don't
have<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:41.340> tight<00:01:41.520> yet<00:01:41.700> I'll<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

have them tight yet I'll get all the
other<00:01:42.299> brackets<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.220> I'll<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.490> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I bought a PEP or peps steering

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
I bought a PEP or peps steering
stabilizer<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> I'll<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> video<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.700> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
stabilizer so I'll make a video of how I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.540 
stabilizer so I'll make a video of how I
mount<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:59.780> okay<00:02:01.310> till<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> next<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.670> later
