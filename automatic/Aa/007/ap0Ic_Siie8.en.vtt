00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.980

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 remembering to simply go 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189
 ninja

 so you can change the points for 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.680
 the points you got that level 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.090
 is pure r or the most expensive experience 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 at this moment it's very important you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 always exceeding the frame limit of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 some credits for you 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 put the advantage of having a limit 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 bigger 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 It's very important this in brazland 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 It is always good if Israel leaves one or 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.810
 two skills took 23 we are going to have 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.909
 a much more exciting battle where 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.850
 a much more chance of victory 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.979
 many more layoffs with a wave of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.829
 layoffs at the highest possible level 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.799
 two hour f's album is a good time 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.520
