00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
fresh tailored looks and I think that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510

worked well with tweeze collection and I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
worked well with tweeze collection and I
think<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.909> us<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.390> nice<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
think for us it was really nice to do a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
think for us it was really nice to do a
choice<00:01:25.290> there's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> lot<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> ponytails<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.520> lot

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

choice there's a lot of ponytails a lot
of<00:01:26.759> shin<00:01:26.939> yawns<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.900> just

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of shin yawns and I think it's just

of shin yawns and I think it's just
mixing<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.740> bit<00:01:28.979> playing<00:01:29.490> around

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
mixing up a little bit playing around

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
mixing up a little bit playing around
and<00:01:29.939> having<00:01:30.000> fun<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> loved

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and having fun and that's what I loved

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
and having fun and that's what I loved
about<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.310> concept<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> rather<00:01:33.479> than

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
about this concept is that rather than

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
about this concept is that rather than
just<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> tight<00:01:34.320> shimmy<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.860> didn't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
just in a tight shimmy on we didn't

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.520 
just in a tight shimmy on we didn't
slightly<00:01:35.430> asymmetric<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> like

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
slightly asymmetric so they kind of like

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.319 
slightly asymmetric so they kind of like
you<00:01:38.100> could<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.579> explores<00:01:39.090> from

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you could see them just explores from

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.940 
you could see them just explores from
the<00:01:39.420> side<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> neck<00:01:40.020> which<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> fun<00:01:40.770> way

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the side of the neck which is a fun way

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.420 
the side of the neck which is a fun way
to<00:01:40.979> approach<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> also<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.740> RIT<00:01:44.159> sounds

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
to approach that also it's RIT sounds

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
to approach that also it's RIT sounds
really<00:01:44.729> complicated<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.380> there

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
really complicated to do is there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
really complicated to do is there
anything<00:01:46.799> people<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.280> home<00:01:47.399> could<00:01:47.729> make

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
anything people at home could make

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
anything people at home could make
themselves<00:01:48.899> together<00:01:49.409> look<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.100> mean<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
themselves together look I mean you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
themselves together look I mean you
could<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.329> tricky<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> very

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
could do it it's pretty tricky it's very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
could do it it's pretty tricky it's very
time-consuming<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.060> been<00:01:54.240> working

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
time-consuming and we have been working

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.899 
time-consuming and we have been working
on<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.960> couple<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.500> weeks<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.219> all

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
on it for a couple of weeks now so all

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.370 
on it for a couple of weeks now so all
the<00:01:57.060> staff<00:01:57.270> relate<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> finally<00:01:58.110> coming

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the staff relate is finally coming

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
the staff relate is finally coming
together<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.920> think<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.640> something<00:02:00.090> like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
together I think to do something like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
together I think to do something like
this<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.630> home<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:01.110> work<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.680> nicely<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this at home would work really nicely to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700 
this at home would work really nicely to
maybe<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.479> wouldn't<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> S&amp;M<00:02:04.530> edge

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
maybe you wouldn't have the S&amp;M edge

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.360 
maybe you wouldn't have the S&amp;M edge
quite<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.250> strong<00:02:05.520> me

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
quite so strong me

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.920 
quite so strong me
you<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:06.640> use<00:02:06.880> some<00:02:07.120> hairspray<00:02:07.390> rather<00:02:07.690> than

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you just use some hairspray rather than

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.050 
you just use some hairspray rather than
the<00:02:08.020> shiny<00:02:08.290> lacquered<00:02:08.830> look<00:02:09.010> and<00:02:09.340> they

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the shiny lacquered look and they

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.670 
the shiny lacquered look and they
definitely<00:02:10.270> think<00:02:10.930> clean<00:02:11.260> up<00:02:11.410> with<00:02:11.560> little

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
definitely think clean up with little

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
definitely think clean up with little
twists<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> bottom<00:02:12.790> even<00:02:13.120> rather<00:02:13.570> than

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
twists on the bottom even rather than

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.450 
twists on the bottom even rather than
doing<00:02:14.050> three<00:02:14.470> sections<00:02:14.950> maybe<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.220> could<00:02:15.310> dry

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
doing three sections maybe you could dry

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.300 
doing three sections maybe you could dry
one<00:02:16.270> section<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.870> split<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.230> into<00:02:17.350> two<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.860> do

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
one section and split it into two and do

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.370 
one section and split it into two and do
a<00:02:18.340> very<00:02:18.640> slushy<00:02:19.000> neon<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.600> bottom<00:02:19.990> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
a very slushy neon in the bottom and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.260 
a very slushy neon in the bottom and
that'd<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.710> easy<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.070> do<00:02:21.160> by<00:02:21.340> yourself<00:02:21.460> that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
that'd be easy to do by yourself that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.420 
that'd be easy to do by yourself that
sounds<00:02:22.540> fabulous<00:02:22.750> thank<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.650> much<00:02:23.860> thank
