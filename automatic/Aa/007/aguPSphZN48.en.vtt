now<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> determine<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.659> trig<00:01:09.720> function

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
now to determine these trig function

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
now to determine these trig function
values<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.549> ahead<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> unit

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
values let's go ahead and use a unit

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.359

circle<00:01:16.040> here's<00:01:17.040> 5<00:01:17.340> PI<00:01:17.610> over<00:01:17.640> 6<00:01:17.850> radians<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
circle here's 5 PI over 6 radians so the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.429 
circle here's 5 PI over 6 radians so the
cosine<00:01:20.850> function<00:01:21.330> value<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.900> negative<00:01:22.170> square

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cosine function value is negative square

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
cosine function value is negative square
root<00:01:22.680> 3<00:01:22.890> divided<00:01:23.220> by<00:01:23.310> 2<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.689> sine

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
root 3 divided by 2 and the sine

root 3 divided by 2 and the sine
function<00:01:25.320> value<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.830> 1/2<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.869> have

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
function value is 1/2 so we have

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.520 
function value is 1/2 so we have
negative<00:01:31.380> square<00:01:31.740> root<00:01:31.890> 3/2<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:33.329> plus<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
times 1/2 or 1/2 I now we'll distribute

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.700 
times 1/2 or 1/2 I now we'll distribute
3/2<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> divisible<00:01:41.009> by<00:01:41.159> 2<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.590> will

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
3/2 is divisible by 2 so this will

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.740 
3/2 is divisible by 2 so this will
simplify<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.159> negative<00:01:44.659> 16<00:01:46.159> square<00:01:47.159> root<00:01:47.280> 3

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
simplify to negative 16 square root 3

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
simplify to negative 16 square root 3
plus<00:01:48.950> 16<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.640> would<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.060> complex

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
plus 16 I so this would be our complex

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.469 
plus 16 I so this would be our complex
