00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
every time I look at this thing I'm

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.280 
every time I look at this thing I'm
thinking<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.330> old<00:04:30.480> kung<00:04:30.660> fu<00:04:30.780> movies<00:04:31.139> where

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.720 
thinking the old kung fu movies where
this<00:04:31.380> dude's<00:04:31.590> chasing<00:04:31.920> somebody<00:04:32.220> around<00:04:32.430> with

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730

a meat cleaver

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.409 
a meat cleaver
because<00:04:35.790> that's<00:04:35.970> kind<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.389> looks

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
because that's kind of what it looks

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.879 
because that's kind of what it looks
like<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.900> blade<00:04:37.110> shape<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.530> me<00:04:39.889> the

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
like in the blade shape to me the

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:57.609 
and the blade is perfectly cut there's

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:58.889 
and the blade is perfectly cut there's
not<00:04:57.819> a<00:04:57.849> lot<00:04:58.029> of<00:04:58.059> grinds<00:04:58.359> on<00:04:58.569> here<00:04:58.689> to<00:04:58.779> get

messed up but the edge is perfectly
matching<00:05:03.599> and<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.659> see<00:05:04.839> it's<00:05:04.959> cut<00:05:05.169> even<00:05:05.499> back

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:05.679 
matching and you see it's cut even back

matching and you see it's cut even back
here<00:05:06.539> you'll<00:05:07.539> notice<00:05:07.719> how<00:05:07.959> thick<00:05:08.259> the<00:05:08.409> spine

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:08.679 
here you'll notice how thick the spine

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:14.369 
here you'll notice how thick the spine
is<00:05:10.199> that's<00:05:11.849> it's<00:05:12.849> probably<00:05:13.449> twice<00:05:13.809> a<00:05:13.869> normal

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
is that's it's probably twice a normal

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
edge he is a hollow ground so deep that

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.289 
edge he is a hollow ground so deep that
it<00:05:22.029> comes<00:05:22.179> to<00:05:22.299> a<00:05:22.499> superfine<00:05:23.499> scary<00:05:24.099> edge<00:05:24.339> like

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:25.299 
it comes to a superfine scary edge like

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:26.039 
it comes to a superfine scary edge like
a<00:05:25.329> scalpel

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:26.049 
a scalpel

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:27.419

I<00:05:26.079> could<00:05:26.319> probably<00:05:26.439> shave<00:05:26.889> with<00:05:27.099> this<00:05:27.219> thing

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:27.429 
I could probably shave with this thing

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:32.489 
I could probably shave with this thing
and<00:05:28.079> wouldn't<00:05:29.079> be<00:05:29.169> too<00:05:29.379> irritated<00:05:29.919> by<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:31.499> when

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:32.499 
and wouldn't be too irritated by it when

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.709 
and wouldn't be too irritated by it when
it's<00:05:32.649> open<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.309> ergonomics<00:05:33.969> are<00:05:34.419> really

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
it's open the ergonomics are really

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:35.969 
it's open the ergonomics are really
quite<00:05:34.899> nice<00:05:35.049> it<00:05:35.289> doesn't<00:05:35.439> look<00:05:35.679> like<00:05:35.829> it's

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
quite nice it doesn't look like it's

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.189 
quite nice it doesn't look like it's
anything<00:05:36.159> special<00:05:36.669> on<00:05:36.729> this<00:05:36.939> way<00:05:37.089> but<00:05:38.019> that's

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
anything special on this way but that's

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.689 
anything special on this way but that's
just<00:05:38.409> enough<00:05:38.679> of<00:05:38.769> a<00:05:38.889> child<00:05:39.159> to<00:05:39.309> get<00:05:39.429> you<00:05:39.549> to

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
just enough of a child to get you to

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.850 
just enough of a child to get you to
stop<00:05:40.360> on<00:05:40.629> it<00:05:40.779> and<00:05:40.929> the<00:05:41.079> way<00:05:41.199> that<00:05:41.379> the<00:05:41.469> handles
