a<00:00:05.009> computer<00:00:05.520> on<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.790> inside<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
a computer on the inside not just the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.110 
a computer on the inside not just the
outside<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.250> an<00:00:08.340> air<00:00:08.460> compressor<00:00:08.610> you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
outside this is an air compressor you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.009 
outside this is an air compressor you
can<00:00:09.330> see<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:09.960> pressurized<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:11.300> 100<00:00:12.300> psi<00:00:12.480> or

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
can see if use pressurized to 100 psi or

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.849 
can see if use pressurized to 100 psi or
seven<00:00:13.620> bar<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.719> well<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
seven bar I think that is and well it

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.550 
seven bar I think that is and well it
holds<00:00:17.039> there<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> tubes<00:00:18.600> use<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
holds there this is the tubes use this

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
holds there this is the tubes use this
part<00:00:19.859> goes<00:00:20.070> into<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> air<00:00:20.580> compressor<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
part goes into the air compressor the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
part goes into the air compressor the
actual<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:21.990> does<00:00:22.560> no<00:00:22.740> valve<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.369> just

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
actual thing does no valve so it just

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.519 
actual thing does no valve so it just
blows<00:00:23.670> straight<00:00:24.060> through<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> tube<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
blows straight through the tube on the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.849 
blows straight through the tube on the
other<00:00:25.650> end<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> valve<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.859> well

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
other end there is a valve and a well

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.310 
other end there is a valve and a well
another<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> those<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.000> backwards<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
another one of those but backwards so it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
another one of those but backwards so it
ready<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.769> an<00:00:32.040> extension<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.210> side<00:00:33.420> I've

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
ready for an extension on this side I've

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080 
ready for an extension on this side I've
put<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> gun<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.070> brush<00:00:35.399> fires<00:00:35.820> air

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
put the gun which is brush fires air

happens when you plug it in this is what
happens<00:00:42.860> take<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.070> end<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:45.059> valve

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
happens take the one end with no valve

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
happens take the one end with no valve
and<00:00:47.899> pressurizes<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> tube<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.610> special

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and pressurizes the tube as well special

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549 
and pressurizes the tube as well special
tube<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> takes<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> pressure<00:00:51.469> but<00:00:52.469> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
tube that takes the pressure but of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
tube that takes the pressure but of
course<00:00:52.770> should<00:00:52.949> eat<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> OPD<00:00:53.460> computer<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.989> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
course should eat a OPD computer up so
