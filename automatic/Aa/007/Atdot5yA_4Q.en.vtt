clips in each end of the wire as you can
see<00:00:26.330> here<00:00:28.340> same<00:00:29.340> wire<00:00:29.900> two<00:00:30.900> ends<00:00:31.460> two<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.640> them

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
see here same wire two ends two of them

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
see here same wire two ends two of them
nine<00:00:35.160> volt<00:00:35.489> battery<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:38.840> yeah<00:00:39.950> you<00:00:40.950> hook<00:00:41.190> one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
nine volt battery and yeah you hook one

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200 
nine volt battery and yeah you hook one
wire<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:43.969> negative

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
wire up to negative

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
wire up to negative
while<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> pot<00:00:46.050> yeah<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.950> positive

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
while the pot yeah that's the positive

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.750 
while the pot yeah that's the positive
one<00:00:48.329> wire<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> negative<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
one wire up to the negative I like to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.420 
one wire up to the negative I like to
cut<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.840> why<00:00:52.020> but

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
cut them like that I don't know why but

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.180 
cut them like that I don't know why but
take<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.610> light<00:00:53.730> bulb<00:00:55.250> 12<00:00:56.250> volt<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.969> again

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
take your light bulb 12 volt and again

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
take your light bulb 12 volt and again
touch<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> bottom<00:00:59.969> well<00:01:00.359> alright<00:01:00.809> touch<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
touch the bottom well alright touch the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.110

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
clip touch it to the side and that will

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
clip touch it to the side and that will
shoot<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> battery<00:01:24.450> high<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
shoot at the battery high if you do it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.359 
shoot at the battery high if you do it
formally<00:01:26.430> pull<00:01:26.880> enough<00:01:27.560> if<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.220> to

I'm<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> take<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.630> other<00:01:37.939> 9-volt

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I'm going to take this other 9-volt

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm going to take this other 9-volt
butter<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.750> is

butter that I have that this one is
going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> interview<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.930> one

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
going to interview here I have that one

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.840 
going to interview here I have that one
right<00:01:47.340> there<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:49.399> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> thing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
right there this one this is the thing

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
right there this one this is the thing
you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.450> 15<00:01:51.960> volts<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you can do to get 15 volts of this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
you can do to get 15 volts of this
battery<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.899> take<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.719> if

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
battery so you take them and you know if

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.580 
battery so you take them and you know if
you<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.960> you'll<00:02:00.960> burn<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.469> but

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
you do it like this you'll burn it but

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
you do it like this you'll burn it but
if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> hook<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> negative<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
if you hook up the negative and the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.190 
if you hook up the negative and the
positive<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.869> each<00:02:07.079> battery<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
positive on each battery see that's a

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.990 
positive on each battery see that's a
negative

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
negative

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.050 
negative
that's<00:02:11.600> positive<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.850> then<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.150> do<00:02:14.330> it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that's positive and then you do it

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.910 
that's positive and then you do it
except<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.210> hook<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.660> up<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.710> ones

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
except you just hook it up to the ones

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.610 
except you just hook it up to the ones
that<00:02:19.160> are<00:02:19.250> showing<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.900> will<00:02:21.050> look<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.320> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that are showing it will look like it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.830 
that are showing it will look like it
should<00:02:21.680> look<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.040> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
should look like this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.640 
should look like this
you<00:02:23.840> take<00:02:24.080> your<00:02:24.410> bat<00:02:24.740> your<00:02:25.040> light<00:02:25.700> bulb<00:02:25.970> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
you take your bat your light bulb I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.020 
you take your bat your light bulb I
might<00:02:27.650> only<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:28.010> able<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.460> this<00:02:28.520> for<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> few

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
might only be able to this for a few

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.730 
might only be able to this for a few
seconds<00:02:29.390> because<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.720> will<00:02:30.050> burn<00:02:30.320> out<00:02:30.560> this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
seconds because it will burn out this

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.760 
seconds because it will burn out this
ball<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.520> ball<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.910> only<00:02:32.000> 12<00:02:32.360> volts<00:02:32.780> there

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
ball this ball is only 12 volts there

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.570 
ball this ball is only 12 volts there
you<00:02:33.890> go

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.950 

it<00:02:37.580> looks<00:02:37.880> better<00:02:38.560> here<00:02:39.560> but<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.580> even

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
it looks better here but this one even

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.230 
it looks better here but this one even
getting<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:42.170> heat<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.920> light<00:02:43.100> bulbs<00:02:43.280> I'm

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
getting to heat up and light bulbs I'm

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.370 
getting to heat up and light bulbs I'm
gonna<00:02:44.540> give<00:02:44.720> them<00:02:45.790> battery<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.510> will<00:02:47.720> heat

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
gonna give them battery but it will heat
