00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.060
 a pasta 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.400
 Delicious delicious ghana and the best of 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.980
 everything is that you do not use that little machine to 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.820
 make the pasta this pasta has two 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.580
 first steps is to make our videos and 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.070
 second is to make the dressing then 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.120
 let's start with the noodles what we're going to 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.540
 do is we 're going to grab a cucumber and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.660
 a green pumpkin and we are going to peel them 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 so they are like that of companies and they're going 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.509
 to be all cucumber and zucchini a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.119
 once fixed we are going to use a peeler 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.650
 of fruits and vegetables and what we're going to 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.430
 to do is that we're going to start doing 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.520
 some thin strips and like that they are going to be 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.570
 our videos from top to bottom 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.980
 you start making thin strips 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.880
 try not fit much 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.730
 the peeler to your cucumber cucumber and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.729
 just start making these strips 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.680
 and see how nice it looks and they're ready 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:59.100
 delicious 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.230
 we met him two and two faces ago and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.490
 good that we are going to need for our 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.860
 delicious to that we're going to use two or 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.500
 three cups of tomato and remember that the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.040
 tomato is a very good source of 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 vitamin C 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.439
 let's use three to four dates that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.420
 now we are going to use to sweeten our 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.810
 dressing and also remember that it is a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.870
 very good source of natural fiber 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.660
 and half cup dehydrated tomato 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.390
 a cup will be to the bench and for the anus 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.209
 cool and if you do not have 33 you can also 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.849
 use dehydrated and finally let's 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.569
 use 2 teaspoons of hemp seed 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.150
 which is very rich in omega 3 6 and 9 is the 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.220
 perfect balance of them and what to me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.319
 I like to do for the dressing is that what 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.989
 eat a strainer to drain 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.720
 the juice and you see as more expeditious 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.209
 well rich and that juice saved because 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.090
 You can use it for other dressings or 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.160
 for your salads is ready but 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.160
 well now if we do not say 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.910
 and they are ready and you can put a 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.530
 little basil or whatever so 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.240
 To decorate it smells delicious friends 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.120
