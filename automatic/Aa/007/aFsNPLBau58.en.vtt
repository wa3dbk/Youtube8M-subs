00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
hi I'm going to show you how to create a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.890 
hi I'm going to show you how to create a
simple<00:00:05.940> wall<00:00:06.410> of<00:00:07.410> rocks<00:00:07.740> using<00:00:08.700> v-ray<00:00:09.120> using

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
simple wall of rocks using v-ray using

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.339 
simple wall of rocks using v-ray using
3ds<00:00:10.530> max<00:00:10.890> a<00:00:11.280> multi<00:00:11.910> scatter<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.930> simple

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
3ds max a multi scatter and a simple

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.770 
3ds max a multi scatter and a simple
script<00:00:13.880> so<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.630> start<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.670> we<00:00:17.670> got<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> go<00:00:18.180> into

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
script so to start with we got a go into

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.620 
script so to start with we got a go into
our<00:00:19.080> script<00:00:19.440> I<00:00:19.860> will<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> link<00:00:21.330> for

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
our script I will get you the link for

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
our script I will get you the link for
the<00:00:22.320> script<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.520> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the script and we're going to do a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.510 
the script and we're going to do a
simple<00:00:24.510> Rob<00:00:24.869> generator<00:00:25.310> we're<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
simple Rob generator we're going to

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.540 
simple Rob generator we're going to
create<00:00:26.760> five<00:00:27.529> rocks<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:31.279> we're<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
create five rocks and we're going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.799 
create five rocks and we're going to
spread<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:37.010> all<00:00:38.010> right<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:39.600> need

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
spread them out all right we don't need

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.799 
spread them out all right we don't need
the<00:00:39.960> script<00:00:40.170> anymore<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the script anymore now we are going to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
the script anymore now we are going to
collapse<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:44.100> those<00:00:44.460> high<00:00:44.820> poly<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.450> rocks

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
collapse this those high poly a rocks

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.180 
collapse this those high poly a rocks
into<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.890> table<00:00:47.280> polish<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.980> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
into a table polish and we're going to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
into a table polish and we're going to
rescale<00:00:50.579> them<00:00:50.790> because<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.450> are<00:00:51.539> too<00:00:52.039> small

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
rescale them because they are too small

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
rescale them because they are too small
for<00:00:53.329> example<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> show<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> box<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:57.530> box

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
for example then I show you a box a box

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.389 
for example then I show you a box a box
which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.520> meter<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> size<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.010> they

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
which is a meter on size you see they

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.919 
which is a meter on size you see they
are<00:01:02.460> small<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.589> let's<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.039> all<00:01:05.929> let's

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
are small so let's take them all let's

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.580 
are small so let's take them all let's
go<00:01:07.109> into<00:01:07.439> rescaling<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.329> selection<00:01:09.630> let's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
go into rescaling just a selection let's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.169 
go into rescaling just a selection let's
scale<00:01:10.889> them<00:01:11.130> six<00:01:12.060> time<00:01:13.399> okay<00:01:14.399> that's<00:01:14.819> better

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
scale them six time okay that's better

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.539 
scale them six time okay that's better
now<00:01:15.749> let's<00:01:16.380> create<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.490> wall<00:01:19.249> let's<00:01:20.249> create

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
now let's create the wall let's create

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.959 
now let's create the wall let's create
our<00:01:20.609> wall<00:01:23.179> just<00:01:24.179> a<00:01:24.420> simple<00:01:24.810> shape<00:01:26.299> like<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
our wall just a simple shape like this

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.010 
our wall just a simple shape like this
right<00:01:29.969> we're<00:01:30.359> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.539> add<00:01:30.689> some

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
right we're going to add some

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.149 
right we're going to add some
subdivisions

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:53.200 

and<00:01:41.369> remove<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:43.079> bottom<00:01:43.850> police

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.870 

okay<00:01:53.870> now<00:01:54.730> let's<00:01:55.730> smooth<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.830> bit<00:01:57.880> maybe

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
okay now let's smooth this a bit maybe

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.430 
okay now let's smooth this a bit maybe
let's<00:01:59.090> make<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.450> wall<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> bit<00:02:00.670> tighter

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
let's make this wall a bit tighter

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.790 
let's make this wall a bit tighter
all<00:02:03.440> right<00:02:04.600> let's<00:02:05.600> smooth<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.200> once<00:02:06.500> and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
all right let's smooth this once and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.390 
all right let's smooth this once and
then<00:02:07.220> make<00:02:07.760> some<00:02:08.229> noise<00:02:09.229> on<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:12.860> this

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
then make some noise on it this is this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.140 
then make some noise on it this is this
is<00:02:13.550> nice

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
is nice

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.270 
is nice
then<00:02:14.870> smooth<00:02:15.260> again<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:17.709> maybe<00:02:18.709> one<00:02:19.100> more

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
then smooth again and maybe one more

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.760 
then smooth again and maybe one more
noise<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:21.070> more<00:02:22.070> natural<00:02:22.250> shape

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
noise just to have a more natural shape

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.400 
noise just to have a more natural shape
okay<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.130> should<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.430> enough<00:02:25.520> now<00:02:26.330> let's<00:02:26.660> put

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
okay this should be enough now let's put

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.600 
okay this should be enough now let's put
these<00:02:27.650> those<00:02:27.980> rocks<00:02:28.720> somewhere<00:02:29.720> else<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
these those rocks somewhere else and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:40.840 
these those rocks somewhere else and
create<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:33.160> scatter<00:02:37.270> take<00:02:38.270> your<00:02:38.590> racks<00:02:39.850> into

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
create the scatter take your racks into

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.940 
create the scatter take your racks into
multivator<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:44.170> scatter<00:02:45.170> them<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.790> wall

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
multivator and scatter them on the wall

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.090 
multivator and scatter them on the wall
all<00:02:48.950> right<00:02:49.160> what<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.860> a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
all right what I like to do is to have a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.710 
all right what I like to do is to have a
preview<00:02:52.820> made<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.510> points<00:02:53.900> not<00:02:54.560> boxes<00:02:55.720> let's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
preview made of points not boxes let's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.830 
preview made of points not boxes let's
increase<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.769> number<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.370> rocks<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.420> 25,000

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
increase the number of rocks to 25,000

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.949 
increase the number of rocks to 25,000
then<00:03:02.840> let's<00:03:03.650> make<00:03:04.489> them<00:03:04.760> some<00:03:05.239> random<00:03:05.660> scale

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
then let's make them some random scale

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.160 
then let's make them some random scale
like<00:03:06.320> from<00:03:06.799> seventy<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.330> hundred<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
like from seventy to a hundred and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.580 
like from seventy to a hundred and
seventy<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.760> should<00:03:11.030> be<00:03:11.120> nice<00:03:11.350> let's<00:03:12.350> make

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
seventy that should be nice let's make

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.750 
seventy that should be nice let's make
them<00:03:12.799> rotate<00:03:13.489> randomly<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.780> all<00:03:15.530> axis<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.220> one

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
them rotate randomly on all axis and one

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.900 
them rotate randomly on all axis and one
more<00:03:16.940> thing<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.420> make<00:03:17.600> sure<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:19.220> pivots<00:03:19.670> is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
more thing is to make sure the pivots is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.160 
more thing is to make sure the pivots is
in<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.450> center<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.140> shape<00:03:21.320> like<00:03:22.280> this

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
in the center of the shape like this

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.060 
in the center of the shape like this
okay<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.739> now<00:03:25.900> one<00:03:26.900> more<00:03:27.049> thing<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.380> do<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
okay so now one more thing to do is to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.860 
okay so now one more thing to do is to
activate<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.459> collision<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:33.459> choose<00:03:34.459> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
activate the collision and choose a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.789 
activate the collision and choose a
radius<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.860> order<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.519> not<00:03:37.700> have<00:03:37.840> holes<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.530> the

radius in order to not have holes in the

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.300 
radius in order to not have holes in the
wall<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.250> will<00:03:41.060> show<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:41.500> if<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.860> now<00:03:43.040> and

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
wall I will show you if right now and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.880 
wall I will show you if right now and
yes<00:03:44.269> make<00:03:44.600> sure<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:46.220> wall<00:03:46.989> shape<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.650> not

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
yes make sure the the wall shape is not

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.310 
yes make sure the the wall shape is not
renderable<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.690> don't<00:03:50.840> want<00:03:51.049> to<00:03:51.140> see

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
renderable because we don't want to see

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.949 
renderable because we don't want to see
this<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.579> we're<00:03:52.760> going<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.970> just<00:03:53.390> throw<00:03:53.510> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
this so we're going to just throw a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.430 
this so we're going to just throw a
basic<00:03:54.410> vehicle<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.390> scene

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.550 

we<00:04:00.440> change<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.600> focal<00:04:04.060> let's<00:04:05.060> put<00:04:05.480> our<00:04:05.750> just

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
we change a bit focal let's put our just

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.930 
we change a bit focal let's put our just
a<00:04:06.710> simple<00:04:08.170> dome<00:04:10.000> we<00:04:11.000> need<00:04:11.120> some<00:04:11.360> ground<00:04:12.940> let's

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
a simple dome we need some ground let's

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.130 
a simple dome we need some ground let's
make<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.210> plane

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.550 

let's<00:04:21.140> scan<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.620> plane<00:04:21.890> 50<00:04:22.820> times<00:04:23.560> let's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
let's scan this plane 50 times let's

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.560 
let's scan this plane 50 times let's
just<00:04:25.400> throw<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.630> simple<00:04:27.050> v-ray<00:04:27.740> material<00:04:28.570> on

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
just throw a simple v-ray material on

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.350 
just throw a simple v-ray material on
the<00:04:29.840> whole<00:04:30.050> thing<00:04:32.260> like<00:04:33.260> this<00:04:33.970> just<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.120> quick

and the basic irradiance map that's all

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.490 
and the basic irradiance map that's all
we<00:04:43.610> need

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
we need

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.860 
we need
it<00:04:45.500> changed<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.010> resolution<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.390> you<00:04:47.420> can<00:04:47.660> see

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
it changed the resolution so you can see

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.690 
it changed the resolution so you can see
some<00:04:48.020> details<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.800> let's<00:04:51.800> make<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.340> test

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
some details this and let's make a test

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
render as you can see this starts to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.030 
render as you can see this starts to
look<00:05:04.700> pretty<00:05:05.090> nice<00:05:05.300> but<00:05:05.840> we<00:05:05.990> have<00:05:06.140> still<00:05:06.620> holes

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
look pretty nice but we have still holes

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.720 
look pretty nice but we have still holes
in<00:05:07.669> this<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.480> this<00:05:08.630> wall<00:05:08.950> to<00:05:09.950> avoid<00:05:10.100> having

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
in this in this wall to avoid having

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.400 
in this in this wall to avoid having
those<00:05:11.570> kind<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.930> walls

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410

I<00:05:12.550> mean<00:05:13.550> hoes<00:05:14.180> we're<00:05:15.020> going<00:05:15.230> to<00:05:15.320> just<00:05:15.500> decrease

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
I mean hoes we're going to just decrease

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.640 
I mean hoes we're going to just decrease
the<00:05:16.730> radius<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.290> rocks

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
the radius of the rocks

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.200 
the radius of the rocks
let's<00:05:18.980> try<00:05:19.280> 55<00:05:20.590> this<00:05:21.590> sholde<00:05:21.919> throw<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.729> more

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
let's try 55 this sholde throw on more

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.620 
let's try 55 this sholde throw on more
rocks

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
rocks

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.100

let's<00:05:23.930> try<00:05:24.169> render

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.190 

and<00:05:30.200> now<00:05:30.950> we<00:05:31.010> have<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.640> wall<00:05:31.910> without<00:05:32.570> drugs

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
and now we have a wall without drugs

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.870 
and now we have a wall without drugs
without<00:05:33.740> whole<00:05:34.430> sorry<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.860> can<00:05:37.070> use<00:05:37.670> this

like<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.650> medieval<00:05:51.650> one<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:53.260> which

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
like you know medieval one and which

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.050 
like you know medieval one and which
what<00:05:54.590> is<00:05:54.620> nice<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.640> don't<00:05:55.910> need

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
what is nice that you don't need

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.050 
what is nice that you don't need
displacement<00:05:56.720> for<00:05:56.900> this<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.860> can<00:05:58.130> randomize

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
displacement for this you can randomize

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.010 
displacement for this you can randomize
the<00:05:59.240> textures<00:05:59.630> on<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.990> rocks<00:06:00.200> you<00:06:01.420> can<00:06:02.420> have

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
the textures on the rocks you can have

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.740 
the textures on the rocks you can have
really<00:06:03.380> some<00:06:03.620> different<00:06:04.310> patterns<00:06:04.700> and<00:06:04.940> most

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
really some different patterns and most

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.030 
really some different patterns and most
of<00:06:05.870> all<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.770> fast<00:06:07.190> for<00:06:07.430> rendering<00:06:09.040> so

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
of all it is fast for rendering so

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.870 
of all it is fast for rendering so
that's<00:06:11.030> pretty<00:06:11.360> much<00:06:12.250> all<00:06:13.250> they<00:06:13.460> wanted<00:06:13.760> to

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
that's pretty much all they wanted to

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.660 
that's pretty much all they wanted to
show<00:06:14.060> I<00:06:14.920> hope<00:06:15.920> you<00:06:16.100> find<00:06:16.310> this<00:06:16.490> tutorial
