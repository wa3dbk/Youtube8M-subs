00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
down into the water and they'll just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.469 
down into the water and they'll just
keep<00:01:30.689> doing<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:32.270> throughout<00:01:33.270> their<00:01:33.450> entire

keep doing that throughout their entire
life<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> plant<00:01:34.470> they'll<00:01:34.829> never<00:01:34.860> need

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
life of the plant they'll never need

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.410 
life of the plant they'll never need
dirt<00:01:35.430> they'll<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.150> into<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
dirt they'll just go right into the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
dirt they'll just go right into the
water<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.770> they're<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
water these look like they're going to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.950 
water these look like they're going to
be<00:01:38.280> pole<00:01:38.520> beans<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.570> we're<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> do

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
be pole beans so what we're going to do

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
be pole beans so what we're going to do
is<00:01:40.259> we're<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> figure<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is we're going to figure out some way to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
is we're going to figure out some way to
give<00:01:41.909> them<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> grow<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.860> maybe

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
give them a way to grow I think maybe

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
give them a way to grow I think maybe
we're<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.759> some<00:01:44.820> wire<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
we're just going to get some wire and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.859 
we're just going to get some wire and
make<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.100> spin<00:01:48.000> dole<00:01:48.299> thing<00:01:48.659> where

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
make them a little spin dole thing where

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
make them a little spin dole thing where
they<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> grow<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.070> still<00:01:50.549> get

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they can grow up around and still get

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.760 
they can grow up around and still get
into<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> light<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.350> we'll<00:01:52.649> be

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
into the light there and we'll be

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
into the light there and we'll be
raising<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.220> light<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.060> plants<00:01:54.390> get

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
raising the light up as the plants get

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
taller I like to keep the light somebody

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
taller I like to keep the light somebody
asked<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:56.880> how<00:01:57.600> high<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> keep<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> light

just<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> few<00:01:59.430> inches<00:01:59.490> above<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> plant<00:02:00.829> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
just a few inches above the plant so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.480 
just a few inches above the plant so
that<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.549> some<00:02:02.700> continuous<00:02:03.180> line

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
that they can get some continuous line

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
that they can get some continuous line

y'all made a suggestion of putting fish
in<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.690> made<00:02:39.870> sense<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> me<00:02:40.470> e

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
in here so and that made sense to me e

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.570 
in here so and that made sense to me e
so<00:02:41.340> we've<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:42.530> 75<00:02:43.530> cents<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> goldfish

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
so we've got 75 cents where the goldfish

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.840 
so we've got 75 cents where the goldfish
three<00:02:45.120> little<00:02:45.420> goldfish<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.519> i'm<00:02:47.519> going<00:02:47.730> to

what's<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.390> i<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:18.780> i<00:03:19.140> already<00:03:19.380> said

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
what's going on i think i already said

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.199 
what's going on i think i already said
that<00:03:19.829> it's<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.010> good<00:03:20.130> thing<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:21.000> fish

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
that it's a good thing because the fish

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.300 
that it's a good thing because the fish
while<00:03:22.049> whatever<00:03:22.320> little<00:03:22.440> fish<00:03:22.680> food<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:22.950> fish

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
while whatever little fish food and fish

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.180 
while whatever little fish food and fish
food<00:03:23.549> will<00:03:23.790> help<00:03:23.900> fertilize<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.500> help

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
food will help fertilize the help

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.849 
food will help fertilize the help
fertilize<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.730> plants<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:28.170> fish<00:03:28.680> in

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
fertilize the plants and the fish in

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.259 
fertilize the plants and the fish in
turn<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.160> help<00:03:29.220> keep<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.609> plants<00:03:29.970> roots

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
turn will help keep the plants roots

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.890 
turn will help keep the plants roots
clean<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.829> healthy<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.880> we'll<00:03:33.630> see<00:03:33.750> what's

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
clean and healthy so we'll see what's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.830 
clean and healthy so we'll see what's
going<00:03:34.079> along<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> that's<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:35.970> update<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.750> now

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
going along so that's the update for now

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.930 
going along so that's the update for now
on<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.380> hydroponic<00:03:37.980> setup<00:03:38.130> eventually<00:03:38.760> we

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
on the hydroponic setup eventually we

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.610 
on the hydroponic setup eventually we
may<00:03:39.060> build<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.390> little<00:03:39.540> room<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.140> do<00:03:40.410> something

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
may build a little room or do something
