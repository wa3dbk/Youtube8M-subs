 offering a radical aspect change very similar to the one we found 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.380
 the two devices either 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 the carpet go up the pair as no interface has improved mails has improved 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.450
 and if some degree of compatibility goes against the sector 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.569
 in agreement 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.909
 one of the web applications and that need that compatibility was the 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.240

 in the place where you are to block the password 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.100
 percent and as mobile updated this service and is already compatible with 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.170
 our device 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.490
 to see the new function 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.850
 see how it works 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.850
 we make our account 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.860
 to lose 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.719
 and when we access the mobile directly or 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.090
 we go 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 default 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.250
 our mail 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.560
 if we click on the cloud 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 ischia superior 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.480
 all applications appear on the left 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.590
 or the courses we can also manage 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.840
 we already know that the search application 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 millions 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 we click 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.190
 I was again asked for full verification by then the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 congressman 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 we have to continue 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 and here we have the new interface 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 to look for my acz 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.800
 here we will have devices like phoenix 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.450
 observe 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 we have the ipad we have one of fontioso iphone that we do not have 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.799
 as you can see it is not locating now we have 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.159
 a 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:14.999
 thalia 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:21.760
 much greater no one map much greater occupies currently studies almost the entire window 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.699
 dt 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.009
 from mobileme 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.789
 i have here the devices with their icon inclusive said 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.860
 we can unfold 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.920
 to concretely kill a message 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:37.929
 blocks 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.509
 the device occurs remotely 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.949
 remember that formerly two periods a small part of the screen 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.459
 showed the map now the frame a shepherd gives the area of ​​the screen in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.459
 this section of movilnet 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.859
 but only the space for its different the different options we have the 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.389
 option 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.849
 send the message 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.199
 the option to remotely lock 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:09.649
 and the option to delete all voter content the device does not 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:14.319
 have no content the case is that we have once lost that nobody is going 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.689
 to believe that information 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.929
 If we want to change the device, we click 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.279
 we quickly have to which device and what is 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.859
 and exp 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.309
 we also say 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.459
 dispositives 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.679
 That this 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.780
 for example they are not located until available ine 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.780
 then it has given us time is still not available the possibility d by 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.709
 rapture 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.959
 agreement 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.909
 in this case, the interested parties receive a positive that was activated and it is not enough 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.159
 available 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.229
 we click on the button 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 we were the question if we are sure agreement 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.149
 we proceed eliminates 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.359
 so she automatically updates the devices 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.479
 that we have 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.669
 configured with bush lotion change acz 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.409
 d as you can see the service has improved both in speed and lieutenant earthenware 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.760
 I felt much better much better screen average with much larger maps 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.260
 that allows us not to have to walk with the dozens of screens to see 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.789
 in the street a specific place 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.259
 we have the possibility to see the map 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.020
 normal format 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 we have the possibility to see it 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.029
 satelite 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.099
 we put enlarged with the cursors agreement 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.429
 it works much more smoothly than the previous version and we also have the 

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:42.680
 possibility of using millennium between streets 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.969
 and it's going to happen 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.360
 if we want to update the status 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.699
 you can see 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.249
 what at the bottom of the devices appears as it has been 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.189
 sing your minute two 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.520
 we can updated 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.680
 for an update to take place and start the view 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.289
 a device 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.819
 and the other device 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.259
 then as you see this function 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.540
 Now 3 is complemented with this mobile review 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:15.790
 much more explains 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.580
 and that can be very useful at a given moment if we lose brings us fontilles 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.770
 makeup 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.759
 something like this happens 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.759
 well, well, let's all give us a next one
