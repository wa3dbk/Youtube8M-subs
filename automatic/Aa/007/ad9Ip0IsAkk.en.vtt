00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.370 
what we're using is the Profoto small
strip<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.299> thing<00:01:31.509> is<00:01:31.630> plugged<00:01:31.930> into<00:01:32.200> the

strip and this thing is plugged into the
Profoto<00:01:32.950> 8a<00:01:33.940> by<00:01:34.869> using<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.320> barn<00:01:35.560> doors<00:01:36.070> we

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
Profoto 8a by using the barn doors we

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.639 
Profoto 8a by using the barn doors we
can<00:01:36.399> really<00:01:36.640> control<00:01:37.060> our<00:01:37.299> light<00:01:37.539> so<00:01:38.200> we<00:01:38.409> don't

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
can really control our light so we don't

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.499 
can really control our light so we don't
blow<00:01:39.039> out<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.520> colors<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:39.970> are<00:01:40.210> going<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.360> be

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
blow out the colors that are going to be

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.270 
blow out the colors that are going to be
coming<00:01:40.750> out<00:01:40.960> into<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.409> back<00:01:41.649> if<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.100> were<00:01:42.159> to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
coming out into the back if we were to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.279 
coming out into the back if we were to
use<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.460> big<00:01:42.759> softbox<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.720> light<00:01:43.929> that<00:01:44.170> would

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
use a big softbox the light that would

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.559 
use a big softbox the light that would
travel<00:01:44.800> across<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.399> room<00:01:45.610> would<00:01:46.270> hit<00:01:46.539> that

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
travel across the room would hit that

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.960 
travel across the room would hit that
and<00:01:47.080> would<00:01:47.289> blow<00:01:47.530> out<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.920> color<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:48.640> we're

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
and would blow out the color so we're

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.490 
and would blow out the color so we're
gonna<00:01:49.090> bring<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.420> barn<00:01:49.630> doors<00:01:49.929> in<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.229> little

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
bit so we can control the light what

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.300
