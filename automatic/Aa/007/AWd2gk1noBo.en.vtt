00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
want to show us the opening mechanisms d

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.799 
want to show us the opening mechanisms d
4000<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.440> here<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> left<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.340> D<00:00:11.700> 50<00:00:12.300> 100<00:00:12.690> on

4000 is here on the left and D 50 100 on

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
4000 is here on the left and D 50 100 on
the<00:00:12.900> right<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> you're<00:00:14.670> gonna<00:00:14.820> show<00:00:15.000> us<00:00:15.120> how

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the right so you're gonna show us how

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.040 
the right so you're gonna show us how
pop<00:00:15.450> open<00:00:15.660> okay<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.100> 5000<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.869> this

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
pop open okay so on a 5000 we have this

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230 
pop open okay so on a 5000 we have this
mechanism<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.920> whether<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.760> actually<00:00:20.880> come

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
mechanism here whether it actually come

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.210 
mechanism here whether it actually come
out<00:00:21.390> or<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.930> down<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:23.029> on<00:00:24.199> DD<00:00:25.199> 5100

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
out or a take down and around on DD 5100

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
out or a take down and around on DD 5100
it<00:00:26.760> comes<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> side<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.500> main

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it comes out to the side and the main

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.830 
it comes out to the side and the main
reason<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.099> doing<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.150> lot<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
reason for doing that is a lot of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.120 
reason for doing that is a lot of the
development<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.439> driven<00:00:31.650> by<00:00:31.890> customer

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
development is driven by customer

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
development is driven by customer
feedback<00:00:33.140> some<00:00:34.140> customers<00:00:34.530> were<00:00:34.680> saying<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
feedback some customers were saying that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.020 
feedback some customers were saying that
the<00:00:36.180> tripod<00:00:36.600> mount<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> location<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the tripod mount and in that location it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810 
the tripod mount and in that location it
was<00:00:39.239> getting<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.399> in<00:00:41.399> response<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
was getting in the way so in response to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.510 
was getting in the way so in response to
that<00:00:41.969> we've<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.390> moved<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> side

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
that we've now moved it to the side

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.690 
that we've now moved it to the side
which<00:00:44.520> effectively<00:00:45.149> puts<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
which effectively puts it there and and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
which effectively puts it there and and
understandeth<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> screen<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> quite<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
understandeth of the screen is quite a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
understandeth of the screen is quite a
bit<00:00:49.440> thinner<00:00:49.829> coming<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:50.489> yessir<00:00:51.180> with

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bit thinner coming for them yessir with

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
bit thinner coming for them yessir with
that<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.600> well<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that as well so it so you can see it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
that as well so it so you can see it
even<00:00:53.699> though<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> screen<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> bigger<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
even though the screen is bigger it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
even though the screen is bigger it's
actually<00:00:55.469> thinner<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> design<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.940> it's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
actually thinner and design right it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
actually thinner and design right it's
2.7<00:00:57.690> inches<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> older<00:00:58.379> model<00:00:58.680> three

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
2.7 inches in the older model three

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.529 
2.7 inches in the older model three
inches<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> new<00:00:59.550> orlean<00:00:59.789> yeah

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
inches in the new orlean yeah

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
inches in the new orlean yeah
so<00:01:01.140> much<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:02.070> slimmer<00:01:02.699> similar<00:01:03.210> design

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
so much much slimmer similar design

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
so much much slimmer similar design
bigger<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.530> well<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> screen<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> also

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
bigger as well so on the screen and also

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730 
bigger as well so on the screen and also
from<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> point<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> view<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
from this point of view when you
consider<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> disc<00:01:08.610> endorsed<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> 1080p

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
consider that the disc endorsed a 1080p

yes<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.100> from<00:02:18.730> from<00:02:19.000> our<00:02:19.210> point<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.570> view<00:02:19.630> often

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
yes so from from our point of view often

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
yes so from from our point of view often
as<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> photographer<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> most

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
as a photographer one of the most

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.510 
as a photographer one of the most
important<00:02:22.930> things<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.770> being<00:02:24.220> able<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
important things is being able to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.210 
important things is being able to
control<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.630> camera<00:02:25.870> most<00:02:26.500> easily<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
control the camera most easily and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370 
control the camera most easily and
efficiently<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:28.210> those<00:02:28.330> situations<00:02:28.990> because

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
efficiently in those situations because

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.510 
efficiently in those situations because
the<00:02:29.500> last<00:02:29.680> thing<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.400> be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
the last thing you want to do is be

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.770 
the last thing you want to do is be
stepping<00:02:30.850> away<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.240> constant<00:02:31.540> having<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
stepping away and constant having to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.680 
stepping away and constant having to
review<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.170> back<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:34.240> see<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.540> lot

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
review the back so you see this a lot

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
review the back so you see this a lot
not<00:02:34.900> certainly<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.350> kind<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.770> pro<00:02:36.010> cameras<00:02:36.460> well

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
not certainly I kind of pro cameras well

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.330 
not certainly I kind of pro cameras well
gain<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.750> moment<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.530> obviously<00:02:39.100> very

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
gain the moment is obviously very

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.030 
gain the moment is obviously very
important<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.290> anyone<00:02:41.830> taking

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
important as it is for anyone taking

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.970 
important as it is for anyone taking
pictures<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.300> ability<00:02:43.480> now<00:02:43.900> within<00:02:44.440> one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
pictures so the ability now within one

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.430 
pictures so the ability now within one
hand<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.550> control<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.600> vast<00:02:47.050> number<00:02:47.290> of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
hand to control a vast number of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.130 
hand to control a vast number of
features<00:02:47.890> very<00:02:48.130> easily<00:02:48.370> efficiently<00:02:49.140> about

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
features very easily efficiently about

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.140 
features very easily efficiently about
having<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.590> take<00:02:50.740> yet<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.220> second<00:02:51.760> handle<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
having to take yet the second handle to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.390 
having to take yet the second handle to
supporting<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.690> lens<00:02:52.870> away<00:02:53.110> makes<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> much

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
supporting the lens away makes it a much

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.540 
supporting the lens away makes it a much
easier<00:02:54.750> way<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:56.140> actually<00:02:56.440> efficiently<00:02:57.400> work

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
easier way to actually efficiently work

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.130 
easier way to actually efficiently work
that<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> way<00:02:57.970> for<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.210> camera<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
that the way for the camera and the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.900 
that the way for the camera and the
lives<00:02:59.320> we've<00:02:59.560> switched<00:02:59.770> for<00:02:59.980> instance<00:03:00.310> it's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
lives we've switched for instance it's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.390 
lives we've switched for instance it's
just<00:03:01.150> there<00:03:01.360> whereas<00:03:02.260> before<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.950> would

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
just there whereas before you would

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.770 
just there whereas before you would
often<00:03:03.520> have<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.910> actually<00:03:04.150> release<00:03:04.390> your<00:03:04.660> grip

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
often have to actually release your grip

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.750 
often have to actually release your grip
of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.020> camera<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.920> actually<00:03:06.190> initiate<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
of the camera to actually initiate the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.670 
of the camera to actually initiate the
live<00:03:06.940> view<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.690> as<00:03:07.750> soon<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.110> release<00:03:08.260> your

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
live view so as soon as you release your

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280 
live view so as soon as you release your
grip<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.820> meant<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.480> other<00:03:10.510> hand<00:03:10.990> had

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
grip that meant that the other hand had

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.470 
grip that meant that the other hand had
to<00:03:11.320> be<00:03:11.560> supporting<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.220> whereas<00:03:12.489> here<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.030> can

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
to be supporting it whereas here I can

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.449 
to be supporting it whereas here I can
turn<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:14.080> very<00:03:14.350> quickly<00:03:14.920> that

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
turn that on and off very quickly that

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.130 
turn that on and off very quickly that
it<00:03:15.610> starts<00:03:15.880> record<00:03:16.330> if<00:03:16.510> we<00:03:16.630> have<00:03:16.750> an<00:03:16.840> SD<00:03:17.110> card

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
it starts record if we have an SD card

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.690 
it starts record if we have an SD card
in<00:03:17.470> there<00:03:17.650> would<00:03:17.800> be<00:03:17.830> recording<00:03:18.400> right<00:03:18.550> now

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
in there would be recording right now

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.130
