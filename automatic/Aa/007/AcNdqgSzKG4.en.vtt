00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
have my friend has a sunnier today and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.470 
have my friend has a sunnier today and
as<00:00:17.160> many<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.420> children<00:00:19.970> hurt<00:00:20.970> very

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
as many of you know children hurt very

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
as many of you know children hurt very
easily<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> therefore<00:00:23.910> they<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.920> not

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
easily so therefore they really do not

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.839 
easily so therefore they really do not
want<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> hair<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.050> often<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
want to do the hair as often as the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.120 
want to do the hair as often as the
adults<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.470> hence<00:00:32.329> many<00:00:33.329> parents<00:00:34.020> would<00:00:34.350> just

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
adults so hence many parents would just

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.479 
adults so hence many parents would just
let<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.899> but<00:00:36.899> today<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.739> want<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> let<00:00:38.430> you

know<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> children's<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
know that the children's here has to be

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.750 
know that the children's here has to be
neat<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.079> has<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:43.950> maintained<00:00:44.670> because

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
neat it has to be maintained because

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.720 
neat it has to be maintained because
everyone<00:00:47.760> looks<00:00:48.120> down<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:49.350> children<00:00:49.890> when

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
everyone looks down on our children when

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.500 
everyone looks down on our children when
they<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.539> locks<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.980> therefore<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.090> do

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
they have locks so therefore if you do

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.410 
they have locks so therefore if you do
put<00:00:55.050> locks<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:56.219> children's<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.059> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
of the hair I want you to make sure that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.359 
of the hair I want you to make sure that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the hair is maintained and it is not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.660 
the hair is maintained and it is not
like<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.110> because<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like this because you have to go in and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810 
like this because you have to go in and
you<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> rip<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> apart<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you have to rip them apart because you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
you have to rip them apart because you
know<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.210> happens<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.590> hair<00:01:19.979> stays

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
know what happens when the hair stays

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
know what happens when the hair stays
together<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.770> gravitate<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.070> each<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.659> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
together it's gravitate to each other so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.870 
together it's gravitate to each other so
the<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.310> become<00:01:27.080> 13<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.439> become

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
the two here will become 13 will become

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
the two here will become 13 will become
would<00:01:29.880> join<00:01:30.210> together<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.040> would

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
would join together and then you would

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.800 
would join together and then you would
end<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.549> having<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.299> big<00:01:33.780> bulky<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> this
