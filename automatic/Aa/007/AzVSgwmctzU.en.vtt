lot<00:01:07.230> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> cars<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.980> seems<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> version

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
but the we saw the new IndyCar revealed
last<00:01:47.430> night<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> several<00:01:48.780> open<00:01:49.530> wheel

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
last night one of several open wheel

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.860 
last night one of several open wheel
cars<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> come<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.790> some<00:01:51.180> classic<00:01:51.510> Grand<00:01:51.690> Prix

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
cars to come and some classic Grand Prix

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.210 
cars to come and some classic Grand Prix
cars<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.620> well<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.159> be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
cars on the way as well that would be

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
cars on the way as well that would be
fantastic<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.760> see<00:01:53.909> hopefully<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
fantastic to see hopefully some of the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
fantastic to see hopefully some of the
old<00:01:55.260> McLaren's<00:01:55.830> perhaps<00:01:56.550> one<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.060> coincide

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
old McLaren's perhaps one to coincide

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.570 
old McLaren's perhaps one to coincide
with<00:01:57.479> James<00:01:58.350> Hunt<00:01:58.560> movie<00:01:58.890> rush<00:01:59.130> coming<00:01:59.430> out

with James Hunt movie rush coming out
later<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.880> year<00:02:00.260> that'll<00:02:01.260> be<00:02:01.320> nice<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.680> see

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
later this year that'll be nice to see

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
later this year that'll be nice to see
and<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.330> it'd<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.450> nice<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.720> see<00:02:04.020> how

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and it you know it'd be nice to see how

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
and it you know it'd be nice to see how
the<00:02:04.229> physics<00:02:05.159> engine<00:02:05.250> handles<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.940> as<00:02:06.090> well

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the physics engine handles that as well

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.839 
the physics engine handles that as well
you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> power<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.280> talk<00:02:08.519> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you know that power all that talk and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.480 
you know that power all that talk and
everything<00:02:08.909> else<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.509> fantastic<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> see

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
everything else it's fantastic to see

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.490 
everything else it's fantastic to see
what<00:02:11.490> they<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.670> do<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:11.970> some<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.390> these

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
what they can do with some of these

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
what they can do with some of these
physics<00:02:13.500> engines<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.010> they're<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> be

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
physics engines that they're going to be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.650 
physics engines that they're going to be

as<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.050> understand<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.650> isn't<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.070> final

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
as I understand it this isn't the final

as I understand it this isn't the final
physics<00:02:17.670> engine<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.150> thought<00:02:18.300> sir<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.050> away

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
physics engine for thought sir so away

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.560 
physics engine for thought sir so away
from<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.100> line<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> first<00:02:21.330> thing<00:02:21.480> we

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
from the line then and first thing we

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.170 
from the line then and first thing we
notice<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.140> accrues<00:02:22.650> proper<00:02:23.430> wind<00:02:23.640> screen<00:02:23.970> now

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
notice is accrues proper wind screen now

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.730 
notice is accrues proper wind screen now
we've<00:02:24.420> actually<00:02:24.570> got<00:02:24.900> glass<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
we've actually got glass with the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.970 
we've actually got glass with the
interior<00:02:26.220> reflected<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.710> windscreen<00:02:28.710> I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
interior reflected on the windscreen I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
interior reflected on the windscreen I
think<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.340> area<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.670> analysis<00:02:30.240> for<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> lot<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
think one area of analysis for a lot of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.230 
think one area of analysis for a lot of
racing<00:02:31.560> fans<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.220> neogaf<00:02:32.760> will<00:02:33.000> no<00:02:33.090> doubt

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
racing fans and neogaf will no doubt

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.810 
racing fans and neogaf will no doubt
look<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.320> light<00:02:34.820> bounces<00:02:35.820> off

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
look at it is how the light bounces off

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.670 
look at it is how the light bounces off
the<00:02:35.970> dashboard<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:36.870> bounces<00:02:37.350> onto<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the dashboard and then bounces onto the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.740 
the dashboard and then bounces onto the
windscreen<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.730> changes<00:02:39.210> when

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
windscreen and how that changes when

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.450 
windscreen and how that changes when
you're<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.050> shadows<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> not<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.040> shadows

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
you're in shadows and not in shadows

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.190 
you're in shadows and not in shadows
that's<00:02:42.090> your<00:02:42.270> element<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> look<00:02:42.840> out<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.080> this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that's your element to look out on this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.290 
that's your element to look out on this
one<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.440> find<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.100> shadows<00:02:44.520> there's<00:02:45.120> still

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
one I find that in shadows there's still

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.610 
one I find that in shadows there's still
quite<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.600> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.960> reflection<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
quite a lot of reflection on the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
quite a lot of reflection on the
windscreen<00:02:46.950> either<00:02:47.640> way<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.240> think<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.020> a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
windscreen either way I think it's a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.480 
windscreen either way I think it's a
really<00:02:49.140> nice<00:02:49.500> effect<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.130> gives<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.370> that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
really nice effect it gives you that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.730 
really nice effect it gives you that
cocoon<00:02:50.910> defect<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> car<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.290> simply<00:02:52.710> means

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
cocoon defect in a car that simply means

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.380 
cocoon defect in a car that simply means
we're<00:02:53.130> going<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.430> more<00:02:53.580> road<00:02:53.850> rage<00:02:54.090> from

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
we're going to get more road rage from

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.170 
we're going to get more road rage from
people<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.320> round<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.800> long<00:02:56.550> corner<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
people so round that long corner up the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.240 
people so round that long corner up the
hill<00:02:57.360> through<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.350> trees<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
hill through the trees I like the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.350 
hill through the trees I like the
section<00:02:59.550> through<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.850> change<00:03:00.120> there's<00:03:00.300> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
section through the change there's a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.640 
section through the change there's a
great<00:03:00.540> feeling<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.930> speed<00:03:01.230> through<00:03:01.440> there

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
great feeling of speed through there

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.630 
great feeling of speed through there

dynamic we'll just wait and see on that
one<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.490> through<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.390> shadows<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
one so through the shadows of the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.640 
one so through the shadows of the
streets<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.750> section<00:03:42.959> again<00:03:43.440> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
streets I like this section again I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.350 
streets I like this section again I
think<00:03:43.860> if<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.040> were<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.550> limit<00:03:44.850> racing

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
think if you were on the limit racing

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.610 
think if you were on the limit racing
lots<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.720> cars<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.200> would<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> great

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
lots of cars this would be a great

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.890 
lots of cars this would be a great
feeling<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.130> speed<00:03:47.489> running<00:03:48.420> at<00:03:48.570> 60<00:03:48.870> frames

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
feeling of speed running at 60 frames

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.330 
feeling of speed running at 60 frames
per<00:03:49.110> second<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:49.739> absolutely<00:03:50.220> fantastic<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
per second it's absolutely fantastic and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.520 
per second it's absolutely fantastic and
again<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.940> going<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> bit<00:03:54.570> wide<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:55.290> player

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
again here going a bit wide this player

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.080 
again here going a bit wide this player
doesn't<00:03:55.830> know<00:03:55.920> their<00:03:56.130> way<00:03:56.280> at<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.520> moment<00:03:56.550> who

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
doesn't know their way at the moment who

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.430 
doesn't know their way at the moment who
can<00:03:57.239> blame<00:03:57.330> them<00:03:57.450> its<00:03:57.750> first<00:03:57.989> time<00:03:58.170> playing

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
can blame them its first time playing

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.400 
can blame them its first time playing
probably<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.700> wheel<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.200> other<00:04:01.200> players

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
probably on the wheel the other players

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.930 
probably on the wheel the other players
aren't<00:04:01.620> used<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.950> using<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.400> wheel<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.730> look

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
aren't used to using the wheel I look

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.729 
aren't used to using the wheel I look
forward<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.270> testing<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.810> wheel<00:04:04.050> out<00:04:04.230> really

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
forward to testing this wheel out really
