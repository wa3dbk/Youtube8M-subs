 Hello you want to finally honter 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.840
 I want to share my build with you 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 remind that I am not the author of these mods I 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.990
 just gathered them together and let's 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.380
 just get to the point and see 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 what is in this minimalist 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.770
 modpak here has everything you need and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.440
 so the first thing that caught our eye 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.489
 it was here the message is not broken 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.090
 This is a new log of received damage which 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.309
 shows the type of projectile and ally 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.449
 feet of an ally whose enemy you are 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.269
 shoots also we have updated log 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.199
 damage done returned this old log 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.410
 detailed damage that shows all 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.120
 inflicted homes specifically for tanks 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.890
 next we have enter the removed shadow 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.310
 blackout 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.570
 no sniper mode and all too 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.510
 commander's camera you can 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.420
 look behind the building and that's what I mean 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.980
 spoke see 65 damage received it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.220
 shows here in loke shows that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.340
 it was artillery and high-explosive 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.650
 projectile which stands for silver that is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.750
 gold will be yellow 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 highlight also if you press alt 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.500
 you will see the nickname shooting it was 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.050
 some 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.930
 european so on we have a minimap 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.480
 xvm minimap configured all she also 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.510
 here I had difficulties for some reason 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.710
 I wanted my config to return exactly 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.990
 all these subtleties are a circle a ray 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.010
 1000 could not remove for some reason was 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.340
 I have a problem 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.320
 she is full screen when you click on 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 caps lock and you can see the map on 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 full screen and I returned the old sight from 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.460
 Jimbo Russified with Russian 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.660
 instead of sake also if we press alt 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.890
 we see hp opponents who were in 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.060
 in the light and here still see take our base 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.720
 and we see how much range of capture and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.470
 how much is left to capture something 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.330
 go to the hangar in the hangar significantly 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.090

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.340
