a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:29.039> program<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.090> she's<00:00:30.270> going<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a little program now so she's going to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
a little program now so she's going to
come<00:00:30.720> down<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.500> center<00:00:31.890> line<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.250> she's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
come down the center line and she's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
come down the center line and she's
setting<00:00:32.910> him<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.180> by<00:00:33.750> flexing<00:00:34.739> him<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.340> the

setting him up by flexing him to the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.650 
setting him up by flexing him to the
left<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:37.070> that's<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.250> energetic<00:00:38.879> entry

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
left and that's a very energetic entry

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
left and that's a very energetic entry
she's<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.380> and<00:00:42.800> he<00:00:43.800> fell<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.340> bit

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
she's got there and he fell a little bit

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.690 
she's got there and he fell a little bit
to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> left<00:00:44.880> there<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.989> Holt<00:00:46.520> is<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to the left there in that Holt is it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
to the left there in that Holt is it
perhaps<00:00:47.880> didn't<00:00:48.270> quite<00:00:48.420> keep<00:00:48.660> enough<00:00:48.899> left

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
perhaps didn't quite keep enough left

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
perhaps didn't quite keep enough left
flexion<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.250> he<00:00:50.340> saw<00:00:50.489> she<00:00:50.640> had<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.790> very<00:00:51.030> nice

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
flexion but he saw she had a very nice

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.780 
flexion but he saw she had a very nice
right<00:00:51.600> flexion<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.590> she<00:00:53.070> moved<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
right flexion there as she moved off and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.549 
right flexion there as she moved off and
so<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> horse<00:00:54.540> was<00:00:54.719> ready<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.260> stay<00:00:55.500> in

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
so the horse was ready to stay in

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
she's going to ride a 20-metre circle

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.319 
she's going to ride a 20-metre circle
from<00:01:00.090> e<00:01:00.379> making<00:01:01.379> sure<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.219> she<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.700> touches

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
from e making sure that she just touches

and leaves the track at be a tipple just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
and leaves the track at be a tipple just
relax<00:01:08.039> the<00:01:08.219> rain<00:01:08.369> forward<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.060> epi

this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.079> full<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:11.010> horse<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.729> it's

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
this is a very full going horse so it's

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.270 
this is a very full going horse so it's
important<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.770> hold<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
important that that we don't hold on to

important that that we don't hold on to
him<00:01:14.400> too<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> she<00:01:15.780> kept<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> very

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
him too much good and she kept a very

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
him too much good and she kept a very
nice<00:01:16.500> rhythm<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.880> circle<00:01:18.330> was

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
nice rhythm there and the circle was

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
nice rhythm there and the circle was
even<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.930> both<00:01:19.110> sides<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.190> she's<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
even on both sides now she's going to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390 
even on both sides now she's going to
come<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> medium<00:01:21.630> trot<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.890> she<00:01:23.189> comes

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

around the corner she's going to flex

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.280 
around the corner she's going to flex
him<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.880> him<00:01:27.090> straight<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.960> the
