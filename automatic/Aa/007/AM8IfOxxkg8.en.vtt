00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
trees and that's a fruit tree that loses

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
trees and that's a fruit tree that loses
its<00:01:33.420> leaves<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> winter<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:35.220> maintain

fruits<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> birds<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.750> every<00:01:43.049> spring<00:01:43.380> go

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
fruits for the birds so every spring go

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.289

into your fruit tree and just start

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
into your fruit tree and just start
nipping<00:01:46.079> off<00:01:46.320> branches<00:01:46.710> never<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.700> off<00:01:47.850> more
