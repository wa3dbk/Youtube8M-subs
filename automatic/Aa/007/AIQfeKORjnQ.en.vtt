i almost wish that there was a

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.470 
i almost wish that there was a
bare-bones<00:03:24.829> mode<00:03:25.370> i<00:03:25.400> wonder<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.209> there<00:03:26.359> is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
bare-bones mode i wonder if there is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.089 
bare-bones mode i wonder if there is
maybe<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.200> wasn't<00:03:27.560> an<00:03:27.680> original

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
maybe there is there wasn't an original

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.160 
maybe there is there wasn't an original
black<00:03:28.250> ops<00:03:28.519> oh<00:03:28.790> maybe<00:03:29.540> i'll<00:03:29.690> check<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:29.989> out

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
black ops oh maybe i'll check that out

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.890 
black ops oh maybe i'll check that out
it<00:03:31.010> won't<00:03:31.609> be<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:31.909> popular<00:03:32.180> as<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.780> other
