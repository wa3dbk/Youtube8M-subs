00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
these two class videos we've done so far

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.580 
these two class videos we've done so far
now<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:44.820> gonna<00:01:44.909> put<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.450> puts<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
now we're gonna put some puts on and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
now we're gonna put some puts on and
quite<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> lot<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> perps<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> days<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
quite a lot of perps in this days for

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.370 
quite a lot of perps in this days for

this class so we're gonna be talking

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
this class so we're gonna be talking
about<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.890> name<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> pot<00:01:50.790> set<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.180> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
about that name so for the pot set up in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.030 
about that name so for the pot set up in
this<00:01:51.450> class<00:01:51.720> or<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.409> sleight<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> hand

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this class or we use in sleight of hand

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.560 
this class or we use in sleight of hand
which<00:01:53.189> requires<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.090> score<00:01:54.390> points

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
which requires two of our score points

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
which requires two of our score points
this<00:01:55.110> decreases<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.860> time<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> takes<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this decreases the time it takes to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
this decreases the time it takes to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
will appear on the ground if you know if

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.790 
will appear on the ground if you know if
you<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:33.700> resupply<00:02:34.150> ammo<00:02:34.930> off<00:02:35.140> them<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.709> you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
you can resupply ammo off them so you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.589 
you can resupply ammo off them so you
can<00:02:35.890> run<00:02:36.430> over<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.239> will<00:02:37.300> pick<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.540> the

can run over it and it will pick up the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.690 
can run over it and it will pick up the
ammo<00:02:37.810> automatically<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.640> doesn't

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
ammo automatically for you so it doesn't

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.030 
ammo automatically for you so it doesn't
give<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.090> an<00:02:40.810> amazing<00:02:41.319> amount<00:02:41.530> nothing<00:02:41.860> gives

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
give you an amazing amount nothing gives

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.860 
give you an amazing amount nothing gives
you<00:02:42.130> sort<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.550> mad<00:02:42.849> club<00:02:43.180> mounted<00:02:43.630> them

occasionally so but you know that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.550 
occasionally so but you know that's
enough<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.450> get<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.810> death<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.350> pills

definitely keep the reflex and then

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.590 
definitely keep the reflex and then
maybe<00:04:05.889> swap<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.549> we<00:04:06.790> know<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.060> extended<00:04:07.420> mads

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
without it or Silas and see what works

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.190 
without it or Silas and see what works
well<00:04:09.819> for<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.090> test<00:04:10.329> out<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.630> glass<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.049> see
