00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
about water this is one of the places in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
about water this is one of the places in
my<00:00:40.620> yard<00:00:40.800> where<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> surface<00:00:41.579> water<00:00:41.820> tends<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
feed off I've even directed some of the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
feed off I've even directed some of the
downspouts<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.360> house<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> area

downspouts from my house to this area

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.950 
downspouts from my house to this area

because I have a raised bed garden that
was<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> consideration<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:49.980> design<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.610> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
was a consideration of my design I can

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
was a consideration of my design I can
take<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> water<00:00:52.020> move<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.829> into<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
take the water move it right into this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
take the water move it right into this
garden<00:00:53.460> area<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> helps<00:00:54.539> keep<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> garden

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110

through my garden through the day

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.890 
through my garden through the day
because<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.760> garden<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.330> started

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because of that in my garden I started

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.800 
because of that in my garden I started
with<00:01:10.020> lower<00:01:10.290> plants<00:01:10.860> over<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.760> side<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
with lower plants over to one side and I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080 
with lower plants over to one side and I
work<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> higher<00:01:13.590> plants<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.909> other

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
work over to higher plants on the other

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080 
work over to higher plants on the other
side<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.470> allows<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.400> plants<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> get

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
side and that allows the plants to get

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
side and that allows the plants to get
light<00:01:18.479> continually<00:01:19.200> throughout<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> day

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
