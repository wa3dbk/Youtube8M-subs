by<00:00:00.800> upper<00:00:01.800> arm<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.460> need<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> spines<00:00:03.060> these

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
by upper arm we need the spines these

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.950 
by upper arm we need the spines these
are<00:00:03.510> controlling<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.080> midsection<00:00:05.960> the

are controlling this midsection the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.629 
are controlling this midsection the
route<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.529> skip<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.859> props<00:00:08.130> they're<00:00:08.400> just

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
route we can skip the props they're just

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.490 
route we can skip the props they're just
for<00:00:08.820> show<00:00:08.849> they<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.660> no<00:00:09.840> effect<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.320> the

for show they have no effect on the
final<00:00:10.860> mesh<00:00:11.040> okay<00:00:11.759> once<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.509> everything

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
final mesh okay once you get everything

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.539 
final mesh okay once you get everything
selected<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> want<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.190> hit<00:00:14.340> select

selected that you want you hit select
here<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.599> were<00:00:15.719> doing<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.230> road<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> said

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
here if we were doing a road like I said

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
here if we were doing a road like I said
we<00:00:17.430> would<00:00:17.640> want<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.390> feet<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.990> toes

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we would want all these feet and toes

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
we would want all these feet and toes
and<00:00:19.470> cast<00:00:20.100> otherwise<00:00:20.670> what's<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and cast otherwise what's going to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
and cast otherwise what's going to
happen<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:21.930> legs<00:00:22.170> would<00:00:22.380> end<00:00:22.650> up

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
happen is that your legs would end up

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.679 
happen is that your legs would end up
kicking<00:00:23.160> right<00:00:23.340> through<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.939> robe<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.390> you're

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
kicking right through the robe as you're

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.450 
kicking right through the robe as you're
running<00:00:24.840> also<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:25.949> thighs<00:00:26.189> we're

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
running also if your thighs we're

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.589 
running also if your thighs we're
controlling<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.060> way<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> your

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
controlling all the way down to your

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
controlling all the way down to your
feet<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.439> would<00:00:28.560> give<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:29.010> weird<00:00:29.189> stiff

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
feet it would give a really weird stiff

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
feet it would give a really weird stiff
look<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.119> everything<00:00:30.330> okay<00:00:31.170> alright<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.920> once

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
look to everything okay alright so once

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
look to everything okay alright so once
you<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.430> once<00:00:32.610> hit<00:00:33.390> select<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.020> there

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you got really once hit select and there

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.270 
you got really once hit select and there
we<00:00:34.350> go<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> see<00:00:35.250> some

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we go now we can start to see some

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.959 
we go now we can start to see some
effect<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.559> parameters<00:00:38.250> we

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
effect over here in the parameters we

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
effect over here in the parameters we
can<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.390> ahead<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.660> select<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.410> bones

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
can go ahead and select different bones

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.369 
can go ahead and select different bones
and<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:41.940> their<00:00:42.239> effect<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.070> okay

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
and we can see what their effect is okay

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
and we can see what their effect is okay
this<00:00:46.379> space<00:00:46.739> around<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.700> bone<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.149> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this space around the bone here is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
this space around the bone here is
called<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.899> envelope<00:00:49.289> anything<00:00:50.219> inside<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
called an envelope anything inside this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.139 
called an envelope anything inside this
bubble<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.390> controlled<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> bone<00:00:53.309> okay

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bubble is controlled by that bone okay

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.170 
bubble is controlled by that bone okay
this<00:00:54.770> bubble<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.949> envelope<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:56.969> called

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this bubble or envelope as it's called

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.820 
this bubble or envelope as it's called
is<00:00:57.750> three-dimensional<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.719> okay

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.219 

anything<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.250> red<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.330> very<00:01:06.570> dark<00:01:06.900> orange

anything that's red or very dark orange

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.550 
anything that's red or very dark orange
is<00:01:07.439> almost<00:01:07.890> under<00:01:08.189> complete<00:01:08.490> control<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
is almost under complete control of the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.859 
is almost under complete control of the
of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.159> envelope<00:01:11.580> anything<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.270> blue<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of the envelope anything is blue like

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.350 
of the envelope anything is blue like
these<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> midsection<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
these down here in the midsection is

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
these down here in the midsection is
very<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.380> control<00:01:16.770> by<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
very has very little control by that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.359 
very has very little control by that
bone<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.509> in-between<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:20.040> yellow

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
bone and the in-between is this yellow

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.929 
bone and the in-between is this yellow
orange<00:01:20.729> dress<00:01:20.850> color<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.140> between

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
orange dress color is kind of in between

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.310 
orange dress color is kind of in between
okay<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.060> i<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> change<00:01:24.479> these<00:01:24.930> envelopes

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
okay if i want to change these envelopes

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
okay if i want to change these envelopes
and<00:01:25.920> grab<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.580> handles<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and grab one of these handles here and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
and grab one of these handles here and
then<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.619> drag<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.070> sideways<00:01:29.970> okay

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
then i can just drag this sideways okay

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
then i can just drag this sideways okay
and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.680> expanding<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and you can see it's expanding the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
and you can see it's expanding the
control<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
control well so you can see that it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
control well so you can see that it's
darkening<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:34.770> vertexes<00:01:35.400> okay

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
darkening a lot of these vertexes okay

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.899 
darkening a lot of these vertexes okay
that's<00:01:37.200> bringing<00:01:37.650> under<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.310> control<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's bringing under more control of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
that's bringing under more control of
that<00:01:39.060> bone<00:01:39.350> basically<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that bone basically the way that the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.050 
that bone basically the way that the
weight<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.759> control<00:01:42.299> works<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:44.060> where

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
weight or control works is that where

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
weight or control works is that where
then<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.869> bone<00:01:46.170> goes<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.250> bone<00:01:47.490> moves

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
then this bone goes how this bone moves

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
then this bone goes how this bone moves
these<00:01:48.390> vertices<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.740> follow<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> depending

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
these vertices will follow it depending

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
these vertices will follow it depending
on how<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.360> weight<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.020> applied<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
on how much weight they have applied to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850 
on how much weight they have applied to
them<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> heavyweight<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.860> let's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
them so you're a heavyweight then let's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.110 
them so you're a heavyweight then let's
say<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> arm

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
say we're in the arm

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.290 
say we're in the arm
here<00:01:58.010> with<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.130> heavy<00:01:59.490> weight<00:01:59.790> these

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
here with a very heavy weight these

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.810 
here with a very heavy weight these
vertex<00:02:01.230> is<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> arm<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> move

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
vertex is in the arm are going to move

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.080 
vertex is in the arm are going to move
exactly<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.840> arm<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.680> they're<00:02:05.370> kind<00:02:06.000> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
exactly with the arm if they're kind of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.450 
exactly with the arm if they're kind of
only<00:02:06.270> having<00:02:06.660> orange<00:02:07.440> control<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.280> means

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
only having orange control that means

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.980 
only having orange control that means
that<00:02:08.610> another<00:02:08.880> bone<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.240> also<00:02:09.479> partially

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
that another bone is also partially

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.330 
that another bone is also partially
controlling<00:02:10.470> them<00:02:10.619> they're<00:02:11.010> not<00:02:11.070> going<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
controlling them they're not going to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.130 
controlling them they're not going to
move<00:02:11.460> as<00:02:11.700> much<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.450> arm<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:13.020> they're

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
move as much with that arm but they're

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.210 
move as much with that arm but they're
going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.590> move<00:02:13.710> fluidly<00:02:13.950> between

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
going to kind of move fluidly between

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
going to kind of move fluidly between
the<00:02:14.640> two<00:02:14.850> bones<00:02:15.090> together<00:02:15.600> we're<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the two bones together we're going to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.610 
the two bones together we're going to
talk<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> second<00:02:18.060> okay

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.830 

so<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.490> back<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> spine<00:02:24.270> here<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
so if we go back to the spine here the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680 
so if we go back to the spine here the
upper<00:02:25.140> spine<00:02:25.880> go<00:02:26.880> ahead<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.060> rotate<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
upper spine go ahead and rotate this a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.020 
upper spine go ahead and rotate this a
little<00:02:27.870> bit<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
little bit you can see that we have a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.810 
little bit you can see that we have a
lower<00:02:31.020> ring<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.560> an<00:02:31.830> upper<00:02:32.100> ring<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.700> can

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
lower ring and an upper ring we can

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
lower ring and an upper ring we can
select<00:02:33.060> either<00:02:33.150> one<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.510> these<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.990> we<00:02:34.200> can

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
select either one of these and we can

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.350 
select either one of these and we can
select<00:02:34.500> any<00:02:34.710> one<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.070> these<00:02:35.370> four<00:02:35.970> handles

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
select any one of these four handles

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.120 
select any one of these four handles
okay<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.400> expand<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.240> or<00:02:39.750> out

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
okay and we can expand this in or out

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.330 
okay and we can expand this in or out
okay<00:02:41.240> can<00:02:42.240> grab<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.600> bottom<00:02:42.990> one<00:02:43.020> also<00:02:46.340> also

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
okay can grab this bottom one also also

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
okay can grab this bottom one also also
if<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.990> select<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:50.100> inner<00:02:50.370> part<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
if I want to select the inner part and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.940 
if I want to select the inner part and
go<00:02:51.810> ahead<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.050> zoom<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> little<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.740> so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
go ahead and zoom in a little bit so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.400 
go ahead and zoom in a little bit so
that<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> better<00:02:54.060> sense<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:55.260> see

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
that you can get a better sense do see

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.630 
that you can get a better sense do see
this<00:02:55.530> yellow<00:02:55.710> line<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
this yellow line right here in the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.970 
this yellow line right here in the
middle<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:57.210> is<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.510> actual<00:02:57.690> bone<00:02:58.170> okay

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
middle this is your actual bone okay

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.510 
middle this is your actual bone okay
then<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.820> inner<00:03:00.620> kind<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.709> egg<00:03:01.860> shape<00:03:02.160> here

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
then this inner kind of egg shape here

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.060 
then this inner kind of egg shape here
you<00:03:03.060> don't<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.390> want<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> change<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.950> at

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
you don't actually want to change but at

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.970 
you don't actually want to change but at
the<00:03:05.220> end<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.700> these<00:03:06.510> two<00:03:07.140> yellow<00:03:07.470> points<00:03:07.830> here

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the end of these two yellow points here

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.979 
the end of these two yellow points here
you'll<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.700> there's<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> ends<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
you'll see that there's the ends of the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.300 
you'll see that there's the ends of the
bones<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.830> can<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.160> these

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
bones I don't know if you can see these

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.880 
bones I don't know if you can see these
little<00:03:11.520> gray<00:03:11.850> boxes<00:03:12.360> when<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.770> in

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
little gray boxes when you get it in

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.310 
little gray boxes when you get it in
your<00:03:14.160> own<00:03:14.340> max<00:03:15.239> you'll<00:03:15.690> see<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.020> with<00:03:16.110> better

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
your own max you'll see it with better

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
your own max you'll see it with better
resolution<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.489> grab<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> those<00:03:18.300> I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
resolution if I grab on one of those I

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.400 
resolution if I grab on one of those I
can<00:03:19.200> actually<00:03:19.550> expand<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:21.180> envelope<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
can actually expand this envelope up and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.199 
can actually expand this envelope up and
down<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.340> actually<00:03:23.610> make<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
down so that I can actually make it

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.560 
down so that I can actually make it
taller<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:25.160> longer<00:03:26.160> than<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.300> just

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
taller or longer than it is not just

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.630 
taller or longer than it is not just
wider<00:03:27.959> okay<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.680> i<00:03:28.800> can<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.220> change<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
wider okay so i can really change the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.229 
wider okay so i can really change the
shape<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> circle<00:03:30.690> or<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.530> long<00:03:32.239> oval

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
shape to a circle or a really long oval

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.490 
shape to a circle or a really long oval
a<00:03:33.450> Kish<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.320> shape<00:03:34.970> okay<00:03:36.110> so<00:03:37.110> now<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.290> can

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
a Kish kind of shape okay so now we can

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.140 
a Kish kind of shape okay so now we can
get<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> sense<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.190> that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.459 

also<00:03:43.150> through<00:03:43.359> this<00:03:43.420> whole<00:03:43.659> thing<00:03:43.689> make<00:03:44.439> sure

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
also through this whole thing make sure

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.000 
also through this whole thing make sure
that<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.249> have<00:03:45.999> edged<00:03:46.450> faces<00:03:46.840> turned<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.530> if

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that you have edged faces turned on if

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.830 
that you have edged faces turned on if
you<00:03:48.129> don't<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.400> edged<00:03:48.609> faces<00:03:48.879> turned<00:03:49.389> on<00:03:49.599> you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
you don't have edged faces turned on you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.479 
you don't have edged faces turned on you
can<00:03:49.959> see<00:03:50.139> that<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.439> won't<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.769> able<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:51.189> see

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
can see that you won't be able to see

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.449 
can see that you won't be able to see
the<00:03:52.420> vertexes<00:03:53.019> okay<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.980> can't<00:03:54.189> see<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
the vertexes okay if you can't see the

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.069 
the vertexes okay if you can't see the
vertices<00:03:54.730> then<00:03:54.879> it's<00:03:55.659> going<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.930> really

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
vertices then it's going to be really

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.660 
vertices then it's going to be really
hard<00:03:56.379> to<00:03:56.439> see<00:03:56.859> exactly<00:03:56.950> what<00:03:57.489> you're<00:03:57.639> doing

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
hard to see exactly what you're doing

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.190 
hard to see exactly what you're doing
you'll<00:03:58.239> just<00:03:58.359> see<00:03:58.510> these<00:03:58.659> colors<00:03:58.840> they're

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
you'll just see these colors they're

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.009 
you'll just see these colors they're
kind<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.700> random<00:04:00.700> f3<00:04:01.450> gets<00:04:01.719> you<00:04:01.840> into

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
kind of random f3 gets you into

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.050 
kind of random f3 gets you into
wireframe<00:04:02.799> mode<00:04:02.950> also<00:04:03.189> sometimes<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:03.939> need

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
wireframe mode also sometimes you need

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.589 
wireframe mode also sometimes you need
that<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.510> see<00:04:04.689> kind<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.019> inner<00:04:05.230> vertices<00:04:05.799> okay

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
that to see kind of inner vertices okay

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.800 
that to see kind of inner vertices okay
and<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.760> pretty<00:04:09.939> much<00:04:10.060> takes<00:04:10.359> us<00:04:10.599> through

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
and that pretty much takes us through

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.869 
and that pretty much takes us through
the<00:04:10.900> first<00:04:11.139> part<00:04:11.409> I'm<00:04:12.219> going<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.430> go<00:04:12.549> ahead<00:04:12.579> and

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
the first part I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:19.099 
the first part I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
for use mainly in fate we're going to

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.719 
for use mainly in fate we're going to
continue<00:04:26.320> learning<00:04:26.710> about<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.099> skinning

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
continue learning about the skinning

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.360 
continue learning about the skinning
modifier<00:04:28.240> as<00:04:28.509> we<00:04:29.080> continue<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.740> work<00:04:29.979> on<00:04:30.160> this

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
modifier as we continue to work on this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.330 
modifier as we continue to work on this
banded<00:04:30.849> mail<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.330> completely<00:04:32.259> skin<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.190> so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
banded mail and completely skin it so

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.779 
banded mail and completely skin it so
that<00:04:33.520> we<00:04:33.669> can<00:04:34.000> use<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.479> for<00:04:34.840> fate<00:04:35.530> okay<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:36.669> its

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
that we can use it for fate okay so its

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.270 
that we can use it for fate okay so its
launch<00:04:37.000> into<00:04:37.300> this<00:04:37.389> again<00:04:37.599> here<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.740> we<00:04:39.160> were

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
launch into this again here so we were

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.490 
launch into this again here so we were
learning<00:04:39.430> about<00:04:39.639> how<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:39.970> envelopes<00:04:40.570> have

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
learning about how the envelopes have

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.760 
learning about how the envelopes have
influence<00:04:42.099> over<00:04:42.370> everything<00:04:43.030> around<00:04:43.270> them<00:04:43.479> so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
influence over everything around them so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.879 
influence over everything around them so
the<00:04:44.770> colors<00:04:45.009> here<00:04:45.370> red<00:04:45.970> means<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.930> this<00:04:47.560> bone

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
the colors here red means that this bone

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.310 
the colors here red means that this bone
which<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:48.639> have<00:04:48.789> selected<00:04:49.000> which<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.900> root

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320

section here have very little control

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.100 
section here have very little control
okay<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:00.909> these<00:05:00.970> ones<00:05:01.210> in<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.479> middle<00:05:01.750> are

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
okay and these ones in the middle are

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.350 
okay and these ones in the middle are
kind<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.590> in<00:05:02.740> between<00:05:02.860> like<00:05:03.520> about<00:05:03.820> forty<00:05:04.210> two

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
kind of in between like about forty two

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.270 
kind of in between like about forty two
seventy<00:05:04.720> percent<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.169> going<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.380> have<00:05:05.560> an

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
seventy percent is going to have an

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.850 
seventy percent is going to have an
orange<00:05:06.909> color<00:05:07.120> like<00:05:07.360> this<00:05:07.530> also<00:05:08.530> notice<00:05:08.830> that

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
orange color like this also notice that

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.680 
orange color like this also notice that
as<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.159> get<00:05:09.340> closer<00:05:09.729> to<00:05:09.909> the<00:05:10.060> outside<00:05:10.509> of<00:05:10.630> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
as you get closer to the outside of the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.749 
as you get closer to the outside of the
envelope<00:05:10.720> we<00:05:11.229> have<00:05:11.349> less<00:05:11.560> control<00:05:11.800> than<00:05:12.460> when

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
envelope we have less control than when

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.719 
envelope we have less control than when
we're<00:05:12.909> closer<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.479> center<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:15.370> of

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
we're closer to the center of the of

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.089 
we're closer to the center of the of
where<00:05:15.909> the<00:05:16.030> bone<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.240> over<00:05:17.229> here<00:05:17.470> on<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.889> right

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
where the bone is over here on the right

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.760 
where the bone is over here on the right
is<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.240> control<00:05:19.570> panel<00:05:19.599> is<00:05:20.080> where<00:05:20.620> we

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
is in the control panel is where we

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.980 
is in the control panel is where we
select<00:05:21.159> our<00:05:21.280> bones<00:05:21.550> okay<00:05:21.820> we<00:05:22.389> can<00:05:22.599> select<00:05:22.780> any

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
select our bones okay we can select any

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.990 
select our bones okay we can select any
of<00:05:23.199> these<00:05:23.259> bones<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.889> as<00:05:24.159> I<00:05:24.340> go<00:05:24.520> through<00:05:24.550> them

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
of these bones and as I go through them

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.800 
of these bones and as I go through them
you<00:05:25.419> can<00:05:25.570> see<00:05:25.840> that

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
you can see that

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.270 
you can see that
we<00:05:28.050> can<00:05:28.230> see<00:05:28.380> how<00:05:28.560> they're<00:05:28.710> affecting<00:05:29.190> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
we can see how they're affecting the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.550 
we can see how they're affecting the
mesh<00:05:29.460> around<00:05:29.610> them<00:05:30.169> now<00:05:31.169> what<00:05:31.290> we're<00:05:31.380> going<00:05:31.470> to

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
mesh around them now what we're going to

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.320 
mesh around them now what we're going to
do<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.980> this<00:05:32.100> process<00:05:32.400> let's<00:05:32.790> see<00:05:32.940> how<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.180> go

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
do in this process let's see how to go

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.230 
do in this process let's see how to go
to<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.450> job<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.620> skinning<00:05:35.070> modifier<00:05:35.669> did

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
to a job that the skinning modifier did

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.900 
to a job that the skinning modifier did
of<00:05:36.570> getting<00:05:36.770> all<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.190> vertices<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
of getting all the vertices in the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.570

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.159 
controlled by okay what we're going to
be<00:05:46.440> looking<00:05:46.620> out<00:05:46.919> for<00:05:46.980> is<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:48.330> all<00:05:48.960> these

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
be looking out for is that all these

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.590 
be looking out for is that all these
envelopes<00:05:49.740> are<00:05:50.000> overlapping<00:05:51.000> each<00:05:51.330> other<00:05:51.450> a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
envelopes are overlapping each other a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.350 
envelopes are overlapping each other a
little<00:05:51.810> bit<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.230> then<00:05:52.620> also<00:05:52.830> no<00:05:53.370> vertices<00:05:54.210> are

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
little bit and then also no vertices are

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.270 
little bit and then also no vertices are
isolated<00:05:55.020> that's<00:05:55.200> that's<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.889> one<00:05:56.040> thing

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
isolated that's that's the one thing

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.710 
isolated that's that's the one thing
that<00:05:56.340> we're<00:05:56.669> going<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.060> be<00:05:57.150> most<00:05:57.450> concerned

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
that we're going to be most concerned

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.230 
that we're going to be most concerned
about<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.410> I'll<00:05:58.590> show<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:58.980> a<00:05:59.130> few<00:06:00.090> little

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
about and I'll show you a few little

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.300 
about and I'll show you a few little
tricks<00:06:00.450> for<00:06:00.870> figuring<00:06:01.590> that<00:06:01.800> out<00:06:01.860> in<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.160> end

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
tricks for figuring that out in the end

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.909 
tricks for figuring that out in the end
okay<00:06:02.880> so<00:06:03.479> here<00:06:03.660> we<00:06:03.750> are<00:06:03.870> in<00:06:03.900> route<00:06:04.139> spine<00:06:04.440> this

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
okay so here we are in route spine this

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.920 
okay so here we are in route spine this
is<00:06:05.100> if<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:06.000> go<00:06:06.150> ahead<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.389> take<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:06.540> look<00:06:06.720> at<00:06:06.840> this

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
is if I go ahead and take a look at this

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.710 
is if I go ahead and take a look at this
this<00:06:07.139> is<00:06:07.200> this<00:06:07.470> top<00:06:07.770> blue<00:06:08.370> spine<00:06:09.150> right<00:06:09.450> here

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
this is this top blue spine right here

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.510 
this is this top blue spine right here
there's<00:06:10.169> another<00:06:10.410> one<00:06:10.500> beneath<00:06:10.919> it<00:06:11.130> another

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
there's another one beneath it another

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.760 
there's another one beneath it another
one<00:06:11.729> believe<00:06:12.030> that<00:06:12.330> then<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.050> pelvis<00:06:13.500> in<00:06:13.710> the

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
one believe that then the pelvis in the

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.540 
one believe that then the pelvis in the
center<00:06:14.400> here<00:06:14.430> is<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.810> root<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.380> then<00:06:17.070> we<00:06:17.370> get

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
center here is the root and then we get

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.980 
center here is the root and then we get
into<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:18.060> other<00:06:18.210> bones<00:06:18.450> that<00:06:18.600> you<00:06:18.690> can<00:06:18.840> see

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
into the other bones that you can see

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.170 
into the other bones that you can see
pretty<00:06:19.169> clearly<00:06:19.290> forearm<00:06:20.250> hands<00:06:20.729> over<00:06:20.940> here

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
pretty clearly forearm hands over here

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.820 
pretty clearly forearm hands over here
the<00:06:21.600> head<00:06:21.810> we<00:06:21.960> won't<00:06:22.169> need<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.380> be<00:06:22.530> worrying

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
the head we won't need to be worrying

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.300 
the head we won't need to be worrying
about<00:06:22.919> okay<00:06:23.700> so<00:06:24.570> let's<00:06:25.380> go<00:06:25.620> up<00:06:25.860> through<00:06:26.220> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
about okay so let's go up through the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.610 
about okay so let's go up through the
bones<00:06:26.520> this<00:06:27.270> is<00:06:27.389> the<00:06:27.540> next<00:06:27.780> spine<00:06:28.020> down<00:06:28.290> you

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
bones this is the next spine down you

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.840 
bones this is the next spine down you
can<00:06:28.740> see<00:06:28.919> it's<00:06:29.070> getting<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.460> midsection

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
can see it's getting the midsection

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.659 
can see it's getting the midsection
pretty<00:06:30.300> well<00:06:30.479> let's<00:06:30.810> rotate<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.380> around<00:06:31.669> you

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
pretty well let's rotate it around you

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.190 
pretty well let's rotate it around you
can<00:06:32.760> see<00:06:32.850> it's<00:06:33.090> got<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.300> pretty<00:06:33.539> nice<00:06:33.690> control

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
can see it's got a pretty nice control

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.040 
can see it's got a pretty nice control
it's<00:06:34.410> overlapping<00:06:34.890> into<00:06:35.370> this<00:06:35.490> chest<00:06:35.789> area

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
it's overlapping into this chest area

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.090 
it's overlapping into this chest area
overlapping<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.260> little<00:06:37.470> bit<00:06:37.560> down<00:06:37.680> into<00:06:37.979> the

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
overlapping a little bit down into the

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.969 
overlapping a little bit down into the
pelvis<00:06:38.280> that's<00:06:38.700> what<00:06:38.820> we<00:06:38.940> want<00:06:39.180> okay<00:06:40.110> go<00:06:40.919> to

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
pelvis that's what we want okay go to

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.800 
pelvis that's what we want okay go to
the<00:06:41.130> bottom<00:06:41.280> spy<00:06:41.729> and<00:06:42.030> we're<00:06:42.479> getting

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
the bottom spy and we're getting

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.390 
the bottom spy and we're getting
everything<00:06:43.080> they're<00:06:43.530> pretty<00:06:44.070> well

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
everything they're pretty well

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.370 
everything they're pretty well
controlled<00:06:44.940> and<00:06:45.150> you<00:06:45.720> can<00:06:45.840> see<00:06:45.990> it's<00:06:46.110> getting

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
controlled and you can see it's getting

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.320 
controlled and you can see it's getting
all<00:06:46.530> the<00:06:46.620> way<00:06:46.680> down<00:06:46.860> into<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.789> very<00:06:47.970> bottom<00:06:48.120> of

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
all the way down into the very bottom of

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.380 
all the way down into the very bottom of
the<00:06:48.450> mesh<00:06:48.630> there<00:06:48.930> okay<00:06:49.860> next<00:06:50.550> one<00:06:50.760> up<00:06:50.940> is<00:06:51.120> the

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
the mesh there okay next one up is the

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.650 
the mesh there okay next one up is the
pelvis<00:06:51.930> okay<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:53.120> there<00:06:54.120> we<00:06:54.210> can<00:06:54.360> see<00:06:54.539> it's

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
pelvis okay and there we can see it's

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.330 
pelvis okay and there we can see it's
getting<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.930> little<00:06:55.050> bit<00:06:55.229> of<00:06:55.289> control<00:06:55.530> over<00:06:55.620> the

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
getting a little bit of control over the

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.590 
getting a little bit of control over the
thighs<00:06:58.820> and<00:06:59.820> then<00:06:59.940> if<00:07:00.060> we<00:07:00.210> go<00:07:00.389> ahead<00:07:00.479> and

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
thighs and then if we go ahead and

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.379 
thighs and then if we go ahead and
select<00:07:00.810> the<00:07:01.020> thighs<00:07:01.320> you<00:07:01.860> can<00:07:01.979> see<00:07:02.220> that<00:07:02.389> it's

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
select the thighs you can see that it's

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.760 
select the thighs you can see that it's
getting<00:07:03.539> a<00:07:03.720> pretty<00:07:03.900> good<00:07:03.990> control<00:07:04.289> now<00:07:04.590> look

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
getting a pretty good control now look

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.969 
getting a pretty good control now look
at<00:07:04.919> these<00:07:05.930> extreme<00:07:06.930> vertices<00:07:07.410> over<00:07:07.650> here<00:07:07.860> on

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
at these extreme vertices over here on

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.680 
at these extreme vertices over here on
the<00:07:08.100> edges<00:07:08.400> this<00:07:08.850> is<00:07:09.060> the<00:07:09.210> kind<00:07:09.419> of<00:07:09.479> thing

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
the edges this is the kind of thing

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.570 
the edges this is the kind of thing
where<00:07:09.900> you'd<00:07:10.080> be<00:07:10.260> worried<00:07:10.620> about<00:07:10.740> that<00:07:11.250> maybe

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
where you'd be worried about that maybe

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.460 
where you'd be worried about that maybe
the<00:07:11.850> envelope<00:07:12.300> didn't<00:07:12.570> quite<00:07:12.780> get<00:07:13.020> for

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
the envelope didn't quite get for

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.440 
the envelope didn't quite get for
example<00:07:13.889> let's<00:07:14.430> say<00:07:14.610> that<00:07:14.820> this<00:07:14.970> envelope

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
example let's say that this envelope

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.940 
example let's say that this envelope
we're<00:07:15.600> actually<00:07:15.750> a<00:07:15.960> little<00:07:16.080> bit<00:07:16.260> smaller<00:07:16.530> look

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:16.950 
we're actually a little bit smaller look

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.159 
we're actually a little bit smaller look
at<00:07:17.070> what<00:07:17.190> just<00:07:17.370> happened<00:07:17.729> this<00:07:18.419> virtus<00:07:18.900> over

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169 
at what just happened this virtus over

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.400 
at what just happened this virtus over
here<00:07:19.350> now<00:07:19.620> is<00:07:19.950> not<00:07:20.760> under<00:07:21.240> the<00:07:21.690> control<00:07:21.720> of<00:07:22.110> any

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
here now is not under the control of any

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.730 
here now is not under the control of any
bone

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
bone

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.770

because<00:07:23.099> it's<00:07:23.250> so<00:07:23.340> far<00:07:23.460> off<00:07:24.000> from<00:07:24.360> the<00:07:24.569> mesh

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780

because it's so far off from the mesh
the<00:07:25.770> left<00:07:25.919> thigh<00:07:26.099> is<00:07:26.160> the<00:07:26.430> only<00:07:26.580> thing<00:07:26.849> that

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
the left thigh is the only thing that
