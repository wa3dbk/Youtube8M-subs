00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
this yeah very different yeah i know i

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.750 
this yeah very different yeah i know i
think<00:00:40.390> it<00:00:40.629> does<00:00:40.780> i<00:00:40.930> mean<00:00:41.079> i<00:00:41.140> don't<00:00:41.320> i<00:00:41.860> don't

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
think it does i mean i don't i don't

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.000 
think it does i mean i don't i don't
think<00:00:43.030> that's<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.270> big<00:00:43.449> issue<00:00:43.600> if<00:00:44.559> anyone<00:00:44.890> at

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
think that's a big issue if anyone at

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.260 
think that's a big issue if anyone at
all<00:00:45.100> in<00:00:45.250> this<00:00:45.370> little<00:00:45.790> tougher<00:00:46.000> for<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
all in this little tougher for the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.700 
all in this little tougher for the
trainers<00:00:46.629> because<00:00:46.750> they're<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.379> ones<00:00:47.620> that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
trainers because they're the ones that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.770 
trainers because they're the ones that
are<00:00:47.920> looking<00:00:48.580> up<00:00:48.760> stuff<00:00:48.970> back<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.239> forth<00:00:49.449> but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
are looking up stuff back and forth but

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.470 
are looking up stuff back and forth but
i<00:00:50.050> think<00:00:50.830> other<00:00:51.010> than<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.339> you<00:00:52.120> know<00:00:52.180> we're

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
i think other than that you know we're

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.090 
i think other than that you know we're
now<00:00:53.170> we're<00:00:53.290> going<00:00:53.500> through<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.710> pretty<00:00:53.860> typical

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
now we're going through a pretty typical

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.939 
now we're going through a pretty typical
routine<00:00:54.640> here<00:00:54.879> which<00:00:55.089> i<00:00:55.420> know<00:00:55.600> i<00:00:55.629> think<00:00:55.960> it's<00:00:56.920> a

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
routine here which i know i think it's a

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.189 
routine here which i know i think it's a
pretty<00:00:57.100> good<00:00:57.220> thing<00:00:57.519> so<00:00:58.050> it'll<00:00:59.050> be<00:00:59.110> a

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
pretty good thing so it'll be a

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.990 
pretty good thing so it'll be a
different<00:00:59.350> look<00:00:59.620> you<00:01:00.370> know<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:00.519> night<00:01:00.790> under

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
different look you know I night under

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.490 
different look you know I night under
the<00:01:01.030> lights<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.449> things<00:01:01.570> like<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:01.839> so<00:01:02.199> I

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
the lights and things like that so I

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.380 
the lights and things like that so I
don't<00:01:02.920> think<00:01:03.129> it's<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.640> big<00:01:03.760> deal<00:01:03.820> at<00:01:04.030> all<00:01:04.089> I

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
don't think it's a big deal at all I

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.969 
don't think it's a big deal at all I
think<00:01:04.570> big<00:01:04.720> picture<00:01:04.839> my<00:01:05.170> said<00:01:05.410> this<00:01:05.590> might<00:01:05.770> be

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
think big picture my said this might be

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.279 
think big picture my said this might be
a<00:01:06.009> blessing<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.149> skies<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.660> these<00:01:07.780> United

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
a blessing the skies of these United

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:14.070 
a blessing the skies of these United
States<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:09.940> game<00:01:11.490> yeah<00:01:12.539> yeah<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:13.570> mean<00:01:13.869> I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
States have this game yeah yeah I mean I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.080 
States have this game yeah yeah I mean I
think<00:01:14.110> either<00:01:14.470> way<00:01:14.710> it's<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.759> huge<00:01:15.970> event

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
think either way it's it's a huge event

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.810 
think either way it's it's a huge event
I<00:01:16.479> know<00:01:16.660> whether<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.990> put<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.259> at<00:01:18.070> one<00:01:18.340> or<00:01:18.580> five

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
I know whether you put it at one or five

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.090 
I know whether you put it at one or five
or<00:01:19.119> eight<00:01:19.270> over<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.840> cases<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.039> said

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
or eight over the cases but like I said

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.620 
or eight over the cases but like I said
it's<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.520> different<00:01:21.670> look<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:22.149> think<00:01:22.509> we've

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
it's just a different look I think we've

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.109 
it's just a different look I think we've
seen<00:01:22.780> one<00:01:23.020> really<00:01:23.830> under<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> lights<00:01:24.970> i

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
seen one really under the lights i

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.520 
seen one really under the lights i
remember<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.479> buffalo<00:01:25.840> which<00:01:26.050> is<00:01:26.200> starting<00:01:26.470> to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
remember in buffalo which is starting to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.970 
remember in buffalo which is starting to
get<00:01:26.619> dark<00:01:26.860> when<00:01:27.070> efficient<00:01:27.700> but

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
get dark when efficient but

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.620 
get dark when efficient but
you<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.370> this<00:01:29.580> one<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you know this one this one will be a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
you know this one this one will be a
different<00:01:30.780> look<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.230> probably<00:01:31.850> need<00:01:32.850> feeling

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
different look and probably need feeling

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
different look and probably need feeling
so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:34.320> six<00:01:34.530> good<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.860> everyone

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so I think like six good for everyone

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.500 
so I think like six good for everyone

and saw the rain pelting down for yard
there<00:01:40.700> nothing<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.880> mean<00:01:42.470> that's<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.650> we're

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
there nothing I mean that's why we're

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.170 
there nothing I mean that's why we're
playing<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.160> eight<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.000> so

playing at eight you know and so

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.150 
playing at eight you know and so
expected<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:46.050> would<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.410> probably<00:01:46.740> think

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
expected if I would have probably think

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.380 
expected if I would have probably think
it's<00:01:47.250> something<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.520> won't<00:01:47.700> God<00:01:47.880> brings<00:01:48.120> along

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's something I won't God brings along

there was clear and sunny how about

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.440 
there was clear and sunny how about
sometimes<00:01:50.670> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sometimes but

sometimes but
no<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.480> think<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:53.770> expected<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:55.150> think

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
no I think we all expected that I think

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.140 
no I think we all expected that I think
everyone's<00:01:56.200> confident<00:01:56.940> everyone<00:01:57.940> taking

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
care of the ice is going to do what they

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.280 
care of the ice is going to do what they
have<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.650> do<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:01.450> there<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.750> place<00:02:01.960> that's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
have to do out there to place that's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.780 
have to do out there to place that's
what<00:02:02.410> we<00:02:02.500> gotta<00:02:02.620> worry<00:02:02.770> about<00:02:02.830> sis<00:02:03.370> if<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.700> was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
what we gotta worry about sis if it was

what we gotta worry about sis if it was
a<00:02:03.820> number<00:02:04.060> one<00:02:04.180> lesson<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.810> learned

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
a number one lesson that you learned

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.930 
a number one lesson that you learned
from<00:02:05.140> playing<00:02:05.530> one<00:02:05.710> outdoor<00:02:06.040> game<00:02:06.280> but<00:02:06.820> you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
from playing one outdoor game but you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.370 
from playing one outdoor game but you
didn't<00:02:07.120> know<00:02:07.180> going<00:02:07.420> into<00:02:07.660> that<00:02:07.810> game<00:02:07.869> Buffalo

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
didn't know going into that game Buffalo

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.350 
didn't know going into that game Buffalo
they<00:02:08.530> came<00:02:08.770> out<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:08.950> saying<00:02:09.310> huh<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.789> line<00:02:10.330> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
they came out and saying huh I line it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.780 
they came out and saying huh I line it
up<00:02:10.509> for<00:02:10.720> next<00:02:10.810> time<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.260> think<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.340> keeping<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
up for next time I think just keeping a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.210 
up for next time I think just keeping a
pretty<00:02:13.000> open<00:02:13.360> mind<00:02:13.720> everything<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.440> not

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
pretty open mind everything and not

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.370 
pretty open mind everything and not
getting<00:02:16.120> too<00:02:16.300> caught<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.870> there's<00:02:17.080> delays

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
getting too caught up if there's delays

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.440 
getting too caught up if there's delays
and<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.950> knowing<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.910> pretty

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
and I think just knowing that are pretty

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.940 
and I think just knowing that are pretty
much<00:02:22.570> expecting<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.590> you're<00:02:23.739> better<00:02:23.890> off

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
much expecting it if you're better off

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.530 
much expecting it if you're better off
expecting<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:24.910> if<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> don't<00:02:25.360> it's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
expecting that but if you don't it's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.479 
expecting that but if you don't it's
great<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:26.590> least<00:02:26.739> you're<00:02:26.860> ready<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.250> so

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
great do at least you're ready for it so

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.570 
great do at least you're ready for it so
I<00:02:27.700> think<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.330> expecting<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.350> have<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.220> adjust

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
I think just expecting to have to adjust

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.060 
I think just expecting to have to adjust
or<00:02:30.940> expect<00:02:31.870> him<00:02:32.020> delays<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.770> things<00:02:32.950> like

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
or expect him delays and things like

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.150 
or expect him delays and things like
that<00:02:33.130> because<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:35.050> quite<00:02:35.530> possible<00:02:35.739> that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that because it's quite possible that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.410 
that because it's quite possible that
you<00:02:36.880> much<00:02:37.060> get<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> ginger<00:02:39.300> posing<00:02:40.300> by

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you much get the ginger posing by

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.450 
you much get the ginger posing by
midnight<00:02:40.780> no

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
midnight no

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.980 
midnight no

when it comes to food when it comes to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.050 
when it comes to food when it comes to
game<00:02:44.170> time<00:02:44.440> easy<00:02:45.340> change<00:02:45.670> one<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
game time easy change one of the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.520 
game time easy change one of the
conditions<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> ice<00:02:46.840> instead<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.380> one

conditions of the ice instead of the one
hundred<00:02:47.590> percent<00:02:47.770> will<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.820> something<00:02:48.970> in

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
hundred percent will it be something in

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.790 
hundred percent will it be something in
the<00:02:49.300> back<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.600> your<00:02:49.690> mind<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> thick<00:02:50.680> the

the back of your mind was a thick the

the back of your mind was a thick the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
ice condition I think it's pretty I mean

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840 
ice condition I think it's pretty I mean
whether<00:02:56.080> you're<00:02:56.350> playing<00:02:56.560> outside<00:02:57.040> or<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.490> the

of<00:02:59.590> adjust<00:03:00.460> certain<00:03:01.240> things<00:03:01.600> whether<00:03:01.840> it's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
of adjust certain things whether it's

bounces or the conditions in this park
plan<00:03:04.450> but<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.710> think<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.670> tend<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.090> simplify

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
plan but I think you tend to simplify

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.570 
plan but I think you tend to simplify
things<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:08.080> little<00:03:08.200> bit<00:03:08.350> more<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.220> know<00:03:09.250> if<00:03:09.460> the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
things a little bit more you know if the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.940 
things a little bit more you know if the
ice<00:03:09.700> gets<00:03:09.940> off<00:03:10.150> you're<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> little<00:03:10.840> slower<00:03:11.050> you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
ice gets off you're a little slower you

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.950 
ice gets off you're a little slower you
know<00:03:12.070> we<00:03:12.220> would<00:03:12.370> do<00:03:12.520> that<00:03:12.670> at<00:03:12.910> other<00:03:13.510> buildings

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
know we would do that at other buildings

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.350 
know we would do that at other buildings
if<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.230> was<00:03:14.320> like<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.470> too<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.640> don't<00:03:16.210> think

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
if it was like that too so I don't think

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.630 
if it was like that too so I don't think
that's<00:03:16.540> anything<00:03:16.990> new<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.830> think<00:03:18.490> that's

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
that's anything new and I think that's

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.940 
that's anything new and I think that's
me<00:03:18.820> expected<00:03:19.270> from<00:03:19.450> from<00:03:19.690> both<00:03:19.840> useless<00:03:20.230> how

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
me expected from from both useless how

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.010 
me expected from from both useless how
