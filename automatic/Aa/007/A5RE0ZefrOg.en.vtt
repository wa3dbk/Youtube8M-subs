updates boot code from there you just

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.490 
updates boot code from there you just
have<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.519> boot<00:03:05.700> up<00:03:05.819> from<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.269> partition<00:03:06.599> you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
have to boot up from that partition you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.649 
have to boot up from that partition you
can<00:03:07.650> use<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.889> grub<00:03:08.099> bootloader<00:03:08.310> easy<00:03:08.879> BCD

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
can use the grub bootloader easy BCD

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.509

what you have to configure manually but

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.030 
what you have to configure manually but
I<00:03:11.700> would<00:03:11.819> suggest<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.209> grub<00:03:12.389> bootloader

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
I would suggest the grub bootloader

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.710 
I would suggest the grub bootloader
it'll<00:03:14.040> automatically<00:03:14.459> detect<00:03:14.760> how<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> boot

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it'll automatically detect how to boot

want to install it from it all you have
to<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:26.310> go<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.879> manager<00:03:27.329> again<00:03:28.669> go<00:03:29.669> to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
to do is go to that manager again go to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.710 
to do is go to that manager again go to
your<00:03:29.879> disk<00:03:30.060> management<00:03:31.849> by<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.909> way<00:03:33.060> don't<00:03:33.359> do

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
your disk management by the way don't do

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.629 
your disk management by the way don't do
this<00:03:33.900> if<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.260> already<00:03:34.379> have<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:35.010> computer<00:03:35.340> that

this if you already have a computer that

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.229 
this if you already have a computer that
you<00:03:35.909> don't<00:03:36.180> want<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.510> install<00:03:36.780> from<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> doing

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
you don't want to install from so doing

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.689 
you don't want to install from so doing
this<00:03:39.419> step<00:03:39.690> will<00:03:39.959> actually<00:03:40.500> break<00:03:41.370> your

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
this step will actually break your

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.909 
this step will actually break your
current<00:03:41.970> installation<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.810> use<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
current installation and use the

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.399 
current installation and use the
installation<00:03:44.489> disk<00:03:44.729> use<00:03:45.599> right<00:03:45.870> click<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.229> it

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
installation disk use right click on it

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.469 
installation disk use right click on it
and<00:03:46.500> set<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.919> as<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.099> active<00:03:47.519> partition<00:03:48.180> on

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
and set it as the active partition on

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.619 
and set it as the active partition on
that<00:03:48.720> hard<00:03:48.959> drive<00:03:49.519> from<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.729> it'll<00:03:51.269> boot<00:03:51.479> up

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
that hard drive from that it'll boot up

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.539 
that hard drive from that it'll boot up
from<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> installation<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.220> you'll<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.430> able

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
from the installation and you'll be able

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.240 
from the installation and you'll be able
to<00:03:53.699> install<00:03:53.849> Windows<00:03:54.299> 7

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
to install Windows 7

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.009 
to install Windows 7
