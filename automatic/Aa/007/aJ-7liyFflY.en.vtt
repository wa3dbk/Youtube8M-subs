00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 the scum were this breaking 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.000
 italy the show that airs from Monday 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.860
 on Friday when we talk about what 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.389
 it happens in the world is true what he says 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.699
 beppe grillo or that you can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 print houses with printers 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.689
 3d and that this is already done in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.890
 United States and China 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.990
 in the last weeks of the campaign 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.359
 electoral I do not say this is one 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.340
 of the big themes because it is not a big one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 theme is a much discussed topic e 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 much pulled out when you want 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 to criticize or agree with beppe grillo is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.850
 to the vision of the 5-star movement 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.710
 whatever it is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 so mine is not a political judgment 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 it is a judgment of a passionate of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.379
 technology therefore without further delay 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.379
 what beppe grillo says is true 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:30.780
 plastic houses need houses of 100 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.509
 square meters of which cricket speaks 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.090
 I'm actually these stuff's not here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.299
 no houses at all are not at all 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 100 square meters and I'm not at all 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 create with plastic what you are 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.250
 looking at are actually 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.799
 constructions made by a private group 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.810
 Chinese is precisely not houses 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 their function currently that of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 be used as slash warehouses 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.640
 offices at very low cost which then a 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.530
 very low cost and questionable given that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.990
 each of these things to be 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 built need for $ 5,000 that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 for a stuff like that it is not cheap at all 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 now let's see why the first 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 technology to build these things 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.520
 remembers from far away 3d printers 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.330
 in the sense that actually the technique 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.310
 it's the same anymore 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.070
 there is a business that follows a software 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.110
 deposit a layer on a layer 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.270
 of material and then this material yes 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 let it cool and it becomes this stuff 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.770
 here but the point is that this material 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
 it is not plastic and on the contrary a kind 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.750
 of blob made with a little plastic of the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.430
 cement is mainly waste 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.440
 building materials that come 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.060
 recycled from classical buildings 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.550
 so you build a building there are 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.740
 of material waste materials 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.660
 is recovered and recycled for 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.040
 do this stuff here the car that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.560
 builds on this thing is not one 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.200
 classic 3d printer and does not cost 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.940
 certainly 50 thousand euros and you can't 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 not even buy was made from 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.990
 custom-made owner and is a prototype 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.760
 if we want another thing very much 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.560
 important of these houses is that they do not 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.660
 they are not even completely do with 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.970
 this project but only the walls 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.990
 perimeter because the roof cannot 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.060
 be done with this sort of 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.920
 3d printer that actually does not 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390
 it was a 3d printer but it was done with i 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.490
 classic methods simply because 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.620
 in the current state of things it is not 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.240
 You can do it with that technique there 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 there is someone who actually is 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.370
 planning to make houses with 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.650
 these fate of 3D printers but for 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.630
 actually build and the project 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 heaven is chasing a group of 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 researchers from a university 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.180
 Californian who wants to build 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.970
 even a villa of 230 meters 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.800
 frameworks a robot is being built e 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.930
 we have the drawings of what one is 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.670
 he would hypothetically construct that is 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.250
 a giant machine capable of 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.950
 walk on the tracks and turn around 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.709
 to the house to pull it up then again 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.260
 building a plastic house is 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.970
 possible we are still on why we are 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.880
 still up there because it actually exists 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.430
 another project but again it is only 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.590
 a project and it is not American does not fit in 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.019
 no American common but it's a stuff 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.840
 Dutch and to present it directly 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.550
 the bbc that went on site to see 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.350
 what these people are doing 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.810
 this technology that is completely 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.150
 different from the previous use a kind 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.850
 of glue then again is not really 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.140
 However, plastic is more similar with respect to 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.269
 that crap previous to 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.340
 plastic is this stuff is used 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.050
 to build a lot of structures a 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.520
 honeycomb because the idea is to make gods 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.639
 big pieces that can then be 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.039
 assembled later 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.889
 so by the workers it is practically like 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.689
 to make big prefabricated buildings 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.120
 they are assembled which is actually one 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.580
 which is already done not with printers 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.560
 3d prefabricated buildings are built 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.999
 various materials and then assemble them later 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.639
 having transported them to the construction site then 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.439
 the difference is the type of production but 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.240
 I'm not around I have houses to show you why 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.819
 this Dutch group is never 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.529
 actually managed to build one 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.659
 house or at least now there is still no 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.129
 successful and the interview that I leave you 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.039
 in description along with everything else 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.599
 it is clear that one hopes in the future of 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.639
 being able to do things like this because 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.460
 the idea and innovate the materials e 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.259
 lower costs which is central 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.240
 in the discussion because actually 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.159
 there is a great Christmas disinformation 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.389
 printed late because you are convinced that 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.819
 3d printers will change 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.139
 completely the way things are done but 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.300
 it is not really so 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.969
 it is simply another way of 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.879
 build materials because pull up 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.259
 a house to pull up an object 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.150
 complex is not just a question of 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.400
 materials and research questions is 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.289
 question of knowledge and it is a question 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.330
 of convenience and not always the dish 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.349
 of convenience is leaning towards the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.719
 3d printer 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.909
 rather often build an object with one 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.710
 3d printer is much more expensive 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.689
 compared to building it with the classics 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.370
 assembly line methodologies in 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.560
 factory in all this talk for 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.089
 other stop completely ignoring the 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.979
 fact that a house needs 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.599
 many things need many 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.639
 materials that must be isolated from 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.080
 cold and hot must be protected 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.789
 there must be insulation 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.979
 be a mess of things that you don't 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.899
 compete competing mason compete 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.759
 an engineer competes with an architect but 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.289
 I know for sure that if it were possible and not 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.939
 it's possible I wouldn't want to live 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.460
 inside a plastic box 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.319
 put under the sun or put under the 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.759
 snow does not seem like a good idea e 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.199
 so again the point is that the press 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.479
 of the lady like so many other things 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.759
 that sometimes go crazy on the internet not 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.800
 they are the panacea for all ills it is not one 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.509
 technology that is opposed because there 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.520
 they are interests to be protected 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.729
 simply a technology that is 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.500
 still very raw is that if it will improve 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.569
 however, it will not solve all the problems 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.610
 of the world we will not all be able to 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.560
 print a house for 10 euros 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.120
 it will simply be one of many 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.649
 technological improvements now I don't 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.000
 I want to make political judgments about 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:39.430
 this thing I advise you not then 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.140
 Andrew 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.450
 that's what I said as pure gold 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.370
 nor to what he says cricket like gold 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.590
 cast compared to 3D printers if 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.300
 you really want to know more google is yours 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.650
 friend but this scum and all that 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.940
 that I have to tell you for today thanks for having 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.100
 watched thanks to mattia and sabrina 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.690
 are from Milan and Turin respectively 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.820
 our fairs to our queen for today 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.900
 they are so cute it is thanks to the 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.120
 thanks to you who have looked 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.380
 Excuse me the monothematic episode every 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.790
 we really need this thing 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.650
 intrigued so I spent a couple 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.060
 hours to inform me to see if 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.950
 actually I could build it there 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.040
 plastic and apparently not home 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.570
 I can still do the good ones anyway 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.670
 I recommend linking described to me 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.170
 I recommend linghi description comments 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.850
 below I like crushed if the 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.900
 video you enjoyed sharing it with 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.330
 someone while you drink a hot tea underneath 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.890
 the blankets, however, beware of the biscuits 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.890
 because then in crumbs on the bed
