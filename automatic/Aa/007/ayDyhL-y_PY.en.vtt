00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
bubble bill with the closure and I think

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.610 
bubble bill with the closure and I think
it<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.730> enough<00:03:45.300> like<00:03:45.960> i<00:03:46.080> said<00:03:46.140> i
