if you've done the glitch right you

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.970 
if you've done the glitch right you
should<00:04:41.890> start<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.490> see<00:04:42.550> mountains<00:04:43.540> or<00:04:44.020> like

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
should start to see mountains or like

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.280 
should start to see mountains or like
flatland<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.030> cheese<00:04:46.210> over<00:04:46.420> here<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:47.260> you

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
flatland and cheese over here so you

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.240 
flatland and cheese over here so you
wanna<00:04:47.590> just<00:04:47.770> keep<00:04:47.860> going<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.400> answer<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.870> you

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
wanna just keep going to answer and you

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.040 
wanna just keep going to answer and you
can<00:04:51.250> see<00:04:51.400> parts<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.750> map<00:04:52.930> you

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
can see parts of it that the map you

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.510 
can see parts of it that the map you
will<00:04:53.200> fall<00:04:53.470> through<00:04:53.680> like<00:04:53.890> I'd<00:04:54.040> be<00:04:54.190> falling

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
will fall through like I'd be falling

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.190 
will fall through like I'd be falling
through<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.880> bit<00:04:55.060> there<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:55.990> will

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
through that bit there so you will

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.410 
through that bit there so you will
really<00:04:56.500> have<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.980> explore<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.910> find<00:04:58.090> out
