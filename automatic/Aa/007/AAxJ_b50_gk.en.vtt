00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
kinky curly curling custard just to lock

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
kinky curly curling custard just to lock
in<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.500> moisture<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.070> unlocking<00:02:41.730> those

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
in that moisture and unlocking those

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.910 
in that moisture and unlocking those
curls<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.990> keep<00:02:43.170> them<00:02:43.320> from<00:02:43.470> getting<00:02:43.590> too

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920

frizzy<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.680> stuff

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
frizzy and I really like this stuff

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.180 
frizzy and I really like this stuff
because<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:48.990> lock<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> curl<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.950> hair

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
because it does lock in the curl to hair

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.430 
because it does lock in the curl to hair
doesn't<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.730> frizzy<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.450> also

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
doesn't get that frizzy but it also

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
doesn't get that frizzy but it also
doesn't<00:02:52.950> weigh<00:02:53.190> your<00:02:53.340> hair<00:02:53.400> down<00:02:53.610> doesn't

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
doesn't weigh your hair down doesn't

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.360 
doesn't weigh your hair down doesn't
make<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.630> crunchy<00:02:55.020> if<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.680> don't<00:02:55.890> use<00:02:56.100> too

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
make it crunchy if you don't use too

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
make it crunchy if you don't use too
much<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.570> doesn't<00:02:57.900> give<00:02:58.020> your<00:02:58.140> hair<00:02:58.320> that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
much and it doesn't give your hair that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.310 
much and it doesn't give your hair that
sticky<00:02:58.890> feeling<00:02:59.180> so<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.360> preserves<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> style

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
sticky feeling so it preserves the style

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.680 
sticky feeling so it preserves the style
keeps<00:03:02.190> out<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.400> frizz<00:03:02.820> without<00:03:03.210> weighing<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
keeps out the frizz without weighing it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
keeps out the frizz without weighing it
down<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.890> said<00:03:05.160> I'll<00:03:05.400> leave<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> link
