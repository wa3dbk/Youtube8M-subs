00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
all right right here we got a star a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.839 
all right right here we got a star a
couple<00:00:05.850> different<00:00:06.150> legs<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:07.730> we'll<00:00:08.730> be

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
couple different legs on it we'll be

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.379 
couple different legs on it we'll be
using<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.480> single<00:00:10.320> injector<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.519> single

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
using our single injector a single

gonna<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.780> tapping<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.470> breaking<00:00:16.920> not

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
gonna be tapping and breaking not

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.800 
gonna be tapping and breaking not
breaking<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.119> connecting<00:00:18.660> these<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> chip

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
breaking but connecting these the chip

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.450 
breaking but connecting these the chip
when<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> rock<00:00:22.140> hits<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.590> it'll<00:00:22.800> make<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.039> break

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
when the rock hits it it'll make a break

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.540 
when the rock hits it it'll make a break
and<00:00:24.109> they<00:00:25.109> won't<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> legs<00:00:26.160> won't<00:00:26.369> be

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and they won't all the legs won't be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.509 
and they won't all the legs won't be
connected<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.240> you'll<00:00:27.570> end<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:28.340> tapping<00:00:29.340> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
connected so you'll end up tapping it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
connected so you'll end up tapping it

you'll end up putting in about four to
five<00:00:58.050> drops<00:00:58.789> you'll<00:00:59.789> use<00:01:00.000> quick<00:01:00.690> pressure<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
five drops you'll use quick pressure and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.549 
five drops you'll use quick pressure and
vacuum<00:01:01.440> cycles<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.940> back<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> forth<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
vacuum cycles going back and forth you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
vacuum cycles going back and forth you
can<00:01:04.739> slide<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> tool<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.519> side<00:01:05.820> see

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can slide the tool to the side see

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
can slide the tool to the side see
what's<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.990> check<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.040> sure<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
what's going on check to make sure that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
what's going on check to make sure that
it<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.670> been<00:01:08.939> filled<00:01:11.540> best<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.930> it's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it has been filled best way when it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
it has been filled best way when it's
multiple<00:01:13.650> legs<00:01:13.860> look<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> couple

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
multiple legs look at it at a couple

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
multiple legs look at it at a couple
different<00:01:15.060> angles<00:01:15.570> you'll<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.439> different

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
different angles you'll see different

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
different angles you'll see different
ways<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.490> reflecting<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> light<00:01:18.299> through<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
ways of reflecting the light through the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.950 
ways of reflecting the light through the
legs<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.439> make<00:01:19.590> sure<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.890> been<00:01:20.040> filled<00:01:20.960> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
legs to make sure it's been filled so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
legs to make sure it's been filled so
sometimes<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> full

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
sometimes you got to look at it a full

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
sometimes you got to look at it a full
360<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> bunch<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> different

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
360 if it's got a bunch of different

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.190 
360 if it's got a bunch of different
legs<00:01:25.350> coming<00:01:25.770> off<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.130> different<00:01:26.520> angles<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
legs coming off at different angles and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
legs coming off at different angles and
what<00:01:31.200> he's<00:01:31.320> doing<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.710> making<00:01:32.220> sure<00:01:32.369> all

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
what he's doing is just making sure all

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.770 
what he's doing is just making sure all
those<00:01:32.759> legs<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.180> filled<00:01:33.420> checking<00:01:34.290> each<00:01:34.470> way

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.859 

but<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:41.270> when<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.450> curing

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
but so far so good when it's curing

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.179 
but so far so good when it's curing
you'll<00:01:43.049> leave<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> tool<00:01:43.590> under<00:01:43.890> pressure

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you'll leave the tool under pressure

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
you'll leave the tool under pressure
that'll<00:01:44.640> keep<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> curing<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.350> sure

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that'll keep it curing and make sure

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
that'll keep it curing and make sure
that<00:01:46.649> those<00:01:46.860> stay<00:01:47.159> filled<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> don't

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that those stay filled if you don't

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
that those stay filled if you don't
leave<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> tool<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.200> under<00:01:49.590> pressure

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
leave the tool on there under pressure

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.350 
leave the tool on there under pressure

end up having an issue and to repair
down<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> road<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> leave<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
down the road so you want to leave it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
down the road so you want to leave it
under<00:01:57.960> pressure<00:01:58.170> today<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.579> bit

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
under pressure today it's a little bit

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
under pressure today it's a little bit
cloudy<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.119> we're<00:02:00.360> gonna<00:02:00.450> need<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> leave<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
