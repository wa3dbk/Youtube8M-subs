different with darker this has to do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
different with darker this has to do
with<00:00:22.769> how<00:00:23.070> pigment<00:00:23.850> actually<00:00:24.810> mixes<00:00:25.289> together

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
with how pigment actually mixes together

there<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.140> traditional<00:00:37.290> color

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
there is not in the traditional color

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.700 
there is not in the traditional color
wheel<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.030> mix<00:00:39.210> my

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
wheel so now I'm going to go and mix my

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.940 
wheel so now I'm going to go and mix my
my<00:00:40.790> my<00:00:41.790> primary<00:00:42.329> colors<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.110> red

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
my my primary colors which are red

my my primary colors which are red
yellow<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.700> blue<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.129> either

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
yellow and blue and I know that either

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
yellow and blue and I know that either
360<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.390> 0<00:00:48.899> gives<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.219> read<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
360 or 0 gives me a very good read and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
360 or 0 gives me a very good read and
we<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> brightly<00:00:52.050> saturates<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> notice

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we want it brightly saturates and notice

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
we want it brightly saturates and notice
they're<00:00:53.370> fully<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.930> fully<00:00:55.050> bright<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they're fully it's fully bright and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.119 
they're fully it's fully bright and
fully<00:00:56.129> saturated<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.289> 60<00:00:58.829> makes

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
fully saturated and I know that 60 makes

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.650 
fully saturated and I know that 60 makes
it<00:00:59.309> great<00:01:00.620> yellow<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.949> watch<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.430> other

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
it great yellow if you watch my other

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
it great yellow if you watch my other
tutorial<00:01:03.660> you'll<00:01:03.870> understand<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:05.280> about

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
tutorial you'll understand more about

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.200 
tutorial you'll understand more about
why<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.439> 240<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.790> perfect

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
why and I know that 240 is the perfect

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
why and I know that 240 is the perfect
blue<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
blue because it's really all the way in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
blue because it's really all the way in
the<00:01:11.939> middle<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:12.659> colors<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.860> I've

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the middle of these colors so there I've

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
the middle of these colors so there I've
got<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.220> primary<00:01:14.790> colors<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.869> we're<00:01:16.049> kind

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
got my primary colors and now we're kind

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
got my primary colors and now we're kind
of<00:01:16.530> duplicating<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:18.180> would<00:01:18.420> mix

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
of duplicating the way we would mix

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
of duplicating the way we would mix
color<00:01:19.049> using<00:01:19.909> paint<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:22.009> need<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
color using paint and need to do that I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.679 
color using paint and need to do that I
know<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.180> halfway<00:01:24.630> between<00:01:25.850> red<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.880> red

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
know that halfway between red and red

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
know that halfway between red and red
and<00:01:27.900> blue<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.130> numerical<00:01:29.700> scale<00:01:30.299> doing<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and blue on the numerical scale doing it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
and blue on the numerical scale doing it
mathematically<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:34.369> 30<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.640> makes

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
mathematically is the 30 which makes

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
mathematically is the 30 which makes
perfect<00:01:36.000> orange<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> mix<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> color

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
perfect orange and I want to mix a color

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.030 
perfect orange and I want to mix a color
that<00:01:38.820> sort<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> looks<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> mix<00:01:40.920> between

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that sort of looks like a mix between

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.090 
that sort of looks like a mix between
this<00:01:41.520> blue<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> yellow<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.979> going

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
this blue and this yellow so it's going

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
this blue and this yellow so it's going
to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> paid<00:01:44.490> half<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> dark<00:01:45.060> quality<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.049> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to be paid half a dark quality to it so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.679 
to be paid half a dark quality to it so
if<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.700> halfway<00:01:47.880> between<00:01:48.229> 240<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
if I know that halfway between 240 and

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.649 
if I know that halfway between 240 and
it's<00:01:51.710> 160<00:01:52.710> 150<00:01:54.590> x150<00:01:56.149> okay<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.329> gives<00:01:57.450> me<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it's 160 150 x150 okay that gives me a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
it's 160 150 x150 okay that gives me a
nice<00:01:57.869> bright<00:01:58.229> green<00:01:58.649> however<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.820> looks<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
nice bright green however it looks like

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.880 
nice bright green however it looks like
the<00:02:00.299> green<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> other<00:02:01.020> color<00:02:01.380> wheel<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the green in the other color wheel I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.539 
the green in the other color wheel I
need<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> darker<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.049> looks<00:02:04.549> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
need to be darker so that it looks more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.330 
need to be darker so that it looks more
like<00:02:06.000> its<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.659> mix<00:02:06.840> between<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.619> blue

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
like its a mix between this blue

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.540 
like its a mix between this blue
is<00:02:08.399> yellow<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.899> looks<00:02:10.080> about<00:02:10.229> right<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
is yellow that looks about right and the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
is yellow that looks about right and the
same<00:02:11.790> thing<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.360> x<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.840> notice<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
same thing for the x but notice it's a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.759 
same thing for the x but notice it's a
darker<00:02:14.010> tone<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.480> quality<00:02:16.290> carries

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
darker tone so that quality carries

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.869 
darker tone so that quality carries
through<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.569> select<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.260> violet<00:02:19.879> no

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
through and if I just select a violet no

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.550 
through and if I just select a violet no
I<00:02:21.830> could<00:02:22.830> make<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> brighter<00:02:24.300> bring<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.410> all

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I could make that brighter bring it all

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.720 
I could make that brighter bring it all
the<00:02:25.590> way<00:02:25.860> up<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.250> want<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.200> red<00:02:28.370> violet<00:02:29.370> somewhere

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the way up I want a red violet somewhere

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.970 
the way up I want a red violet somewhere
between<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.420> red<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.019> looks<00:02:31.680> about

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
between the red and the looks about

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
between the red and the looks about
right<00:02:32.280> okay<00:02:32.879> we're<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.209> do<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.480> quickly

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
you get too much black in it it looks

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.660 
you get too much black in it it looks
like<00:03:15.060> an<00:03:15.720> olive<00:03:16.019> green<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:17.069> looks<00:03:17.340> pretty

bit<00:03:30.030> darker<00:03:30.630> hmm<00:03:31.139> you<00:03:31.560> know<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:31.859> about

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
bit darker hmm you know it's about

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.190 
bit darker hmm you know it's about
halfway<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.790> where<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.209> cyan<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.049> it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
halfway it's where the cyan is but it's

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.050 
halfway it's where the cyan is but it's
got<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.530> have<00:03:34.650> black<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> mix<00:03:35.519> otherwise

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
got to have black in the mix otherwise

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.039 
got to have black in the mix otherwise
it<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.829> doesn't<00:03:37.829> look<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.810> white

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
it just doesn't look like it's the white

it just doesn't look like it's the white
enix<00:03:40.530> pretty<00:03:41.280> good<00:03:41.549> me<00:03:41.790> try<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.269> one<00:03:42.720> yeah<00:03:43.290> I

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
enix pretty good me try that one yeah I

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.740 
enix pretty good me try that one yeah I
do<00:03:43.470> by<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.799> because<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.790> could<00:03:45.239> probably<00:03:45.419> even<00:03:45.569> go

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
do by I because I could probably even go

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.960 
do by I because I could probably even go
darker<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.530> looks<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:47.099> could<00:03:47.459> even<00:03:47.760> go

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
darker that looks like it could even go

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.629 
darker that looks like it could even go
a<00:03:48.000> little<00:03:48.599> bit<00:03:48.870> darker<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.190> picks<00:03:50.459> up

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
a little bit darker so that it picks up

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.150 
a little bit darker so that it picks up
the<00:03:50.819> quality<00:03:51.419> between<00:03:51.599> these<00:03:51.989> two<00:03:52.290> hmm<00:03:52.859> you

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
the quality between these two hmm you

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.089 
the quality between these two hmm you
can<00:03:53.340> code<00:03:53.549> could<00:03:53.849> go<00:03:54.030> even<00:03:54.590> closer<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
can code could go even closer to the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.470 
can code could go even closer to the
blue<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:57.030> right<00:03:58.400> thank<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.819> know<00:03:59.970> just
