00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.520
 Hey. 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.616
 I invite you to get to know this portable device. 

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:20.453
 Stylish ultrabook with Intel i5 processor from Samsung. 

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.473
 Let's check what is this housing? 

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:30.620
 Samsung 5 series computer with the code name NP530U3C-A05PL 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.673
 it is obviously ultrabook inspired by Intel. 

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:37.520
 This means, above all, certain performance requirements, 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.093
 which in turn involves what the computer has on board. 

00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:45.386
 And in the case of this Samsung we have the aforementioned dual-core i5 processor. 

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.320
 For this integrated Intel graphics card, 4GB of RAM 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.693
 and 500 GB of disk storage. 

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:57.160
 Of course, the computer also supports wireless WiFi and bluetooth connectivity. 

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.273
 The interior of this computer is impressive. 

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.340
 It seems that one should not judge a laptop by its housing, 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.560
 but this one looks really solid. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.653
 The computer is light and undoubtedly mobile. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.726
 When it comes to dimensions, this Samsung series 5 does not stand out from the family. 

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:18.800
 Weight about 1.5 kg, and width just over 30 cm. 

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:25.773
 All this so that the housing can fit a 16: 9 screen with a diagonal of 13.3 inches. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.553
 The matrix is ​​matte and anti-reflective, and offers a resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels. 

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:37.826
 Under the screen there are stereo speakers. 

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:41.260
 The built-in sound system is Intel High Definition Audio. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.106
 Above him, a webcam was placed for Internet connections. 

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:50.986
 On the right side above the keyboard there is a button that allows you to turn the computer on and off. 

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.146
 The keyboard does not hide any surprises. 

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:57.280
 Comfortable, offers good access to function keys. 

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.820
 A microphone was built on the left side. 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.840
 In the lower left corner, you will find four status indicators, 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.106
 informing about the wireless connection to the Internet or the operation of the hard disk. 

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:13.700
 Placed in a classic place, the multi-touch Touch Pad is flat, 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.333
 offers scrolling and gesture support. 

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.386
 There are buttons next to the edge of the laptop. 

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:24.540
 On the right side there are two USB 2.0 ports and a memory card slot. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.620
 On the left there are many more entries and exits. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.400
 Looking from the back of the computer: the power supply socket, 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.073
 sliding wired network port, USB 3.0 socket, 

00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:37.346
 digital audio-video transmission port, 

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.773
 headphone socket, and finally a mini-monitor port. 

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:46.806
 We have already mentioned that the Samsung NP530U3C-A05PL 

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:48.933
 to ultrabook inspired by Intel. 

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:52.040
 The Windows 8 operating system was installed on it. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.920
 In turn, technologies that accelerate the operation of the ultrabook are the result of Samsung's work. 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.713
 Due to Fast Boot the laptop starts in 20 seconds, 

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:04.680
 and thanks to Fast Start comes out of sleep in barely two seconds! 

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:10.773
 Finally, Fast Browsing allows you to watch frequently visited websites twice as fast. 

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:18.306
 One of the frequently visited pages can be documents stored in the cloud thanks to the Google Drive service. 

00:03:18.673 --> 00:03:23.166
 After installing the appropriate application, the Google Drive folder will appear on your desktop. 

00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:29.453
 Being logged in to the gmail account, just select the DISK option on the black menu bar 

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:34.193
 that every document, form or sheet created by us will reach our cloud. 

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:41.660
 A document created on the computer can be edited without problems on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 tablet 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.486
 - not connecting devices with any cables. 

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:48.873
 All we need to do is install the free Google Drive app. 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.620
 By starting it, we will get access to all our works, 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.973
 so we can open the document on Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and easily modify it. 

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:03.300
 As a result, we do not have to take even a light laptop in the road 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.193
 just an even lighter Samsung tablet to work on the text. 

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:12.160
 And to share the results of our work, but we will talk about this on another occasion. 

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:18.720
 Design and performance - these are often repeated words in the context of the latest mobile devices. 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.953
 Users once again ceased to pay attention solely to the appearance of the computer. 

00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:27.206
 Design is important, but it is important 

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:31.426
 how to make the laptop run on the battery for as long as possible. 

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:34.340
 To do this, look at the settings. 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.086
 The Samsung NP530U3C-A05PL offers a variety of performance options. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.986
 To look at them, just click on the battery icon located in the lower right corner. 

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:49.133
 Then click on More power options. 

00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:53.153
 Two modes are offered as standard: Energy saving 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.693
 and Optimized by Samsung. 

00:04:56.786 --> 00:05:00.580
 Each of them can be modified by clicking on Change plan settings. 

00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:04.733
 After selecting this option, we can influence the dimmed screen, 

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:07.840
 turning it off, brightness or entering sleep mode. 

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:12.266
 When we click on Change advanced power settings, 

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:16.533
 we gain control over disabling the hard drive or USB settings. 

00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:20.280
 In the latter case, we can even decide 

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:25.500
 whether despite the sleep mode, the ultrabook will be powered by a smartphone via USB ports. 

00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:29.786
 The management option is very much, that is why the equipment manufacturers 

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:32.806
 they prepare optimized energy management plans. 

00:05:33.086 --> 00:05:37.506
 However, it is worth considering how often we play movies or browse the Internet, 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.153
 or whether our desktop really needs to be particularly dynamic. 

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:46.426
 Good battery management will allow us to extend the operating time of the computer by up to an hour. 

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:50.906
 Being in the power options it is worth paying attention to the left part of the menu. 

00:05:50.906 --> 00:05:54.993
 The methods of extending the battery's operating time also appear here. 

00:05:54.993 --> 00:05:59.053
 We can even choose the effect of closing the cover depending on the power supply 

00:05:59.053 --> 00:06:03.513
 - will the ultrabook connected to power go to sleep, hibernate or turn off? 

00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:05.580
 What if it is powered by a battery? 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.166
 It's also worth spending time on the mechanism of the screen, 

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.166
 which consumes the most electricity. 

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:14.160
 Here we choose the time of dimming or turning off the matrix 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.880
 - why should it shine if we do not use it? 

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.866
 The same applies to the computer going into sleep mode. 

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:23.926
 The right time configuration and previous screen brightness changes 

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:28.280
 will allow you to better adjust the operation of the ultrabook to the user's habits. 

00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:32.713
 When you start your new computer for the first time, it's worth spending some time 

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:35.153
 to configure such details. 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.593
 Increasingly, the laptop accompanies us throughout the day and 

00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:44.500
 it is not worth taking the charger if it is properly configured 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.820
 battery may be enough for the day. 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:54.086
 In Samsung's ultrabook 5, the battery should last for six hours. 

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.526
 This is not the only advantage of this device. 

00:06:56.526 --> 00:07:00.780
 It is worth paying attention to the speed of getting out of sleep. 

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:02.780
 It's all in our episode. 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.960
 As usual, I invite you to our website 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.113
 and to the world of stylish mobile devices. 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.280
 See you later!
