00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.580 
pre-alpha we just need to get some
features<00:04:07.050> in<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> game<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:09.480> think<00:04:10.440> will<00:04:10.530> be

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
features in the game and I think will be

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.740 
features in the game and I think will be
even<00:04:10.710> more<00:04:10.860> fun<00:04:11.010> once<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.910> have<00:04:12.120> turned<00:04:12.390> fraps

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
even more fun once I have turned fraps

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.690 
even more fun once I have turned fraps
off<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.230> performance<00:04:13.740> is<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:14.220> little

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
off and the performance is a little

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.140
