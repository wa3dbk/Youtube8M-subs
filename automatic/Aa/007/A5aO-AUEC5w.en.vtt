it to be a fairly comfortable hammock
the<00:02:27.990> only<00:02:28.200> reason<00:02:28.380> why<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> haven't<00:02:28.920> really

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the only reason why I haven't really

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.580 
the only reason why I haven't really
used<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:30.120> too<00:02:30.270> much<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.690> because<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.230> doesn't

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
used it too much is because it doesn't

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
used it too much is because it doesn't
have<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.770> attached<00:02:32.220> bug<00:02:32.880> net<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.540> one

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
have the attached bug net on this one

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.930 
have the attached bug net on this one
and<00:02:35.060> all<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.510> bug<00:02:37.050> nets<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.940> don't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
and all the bug nets that I have don't

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.760 
and all the bug nets that I have don't
fit<00:02:39.300> with<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> system<00:02:39.960> because<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.530> long

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
fit with the system because it's so long

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.010 
fit with the system because it's so long
so<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.970> would<00:02:42.150> recommend<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.660> you're<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.120 
so I would recommend if you're going to
order<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> weight<00:02:44.460> weenies<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.660> you

already see I'm on my back it's
comfortable<00:02:53.150> now<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.540> wanted<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.320> do<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
comfortable now I wanted to do a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.650 
comfortable now I wanted to do a
jackhammer

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.780 

it's<00:03:03.290> all<00:03:03.500> right

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.979 

it's<00:03:08.269> better<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.810> side<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:11.629> side<00:03:11.689> my

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
it's better on this side this side my

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.530 
it's better on this side this side my
arm<00:03:12.200> kinda<00:03:12.379> goes<00:03:12.650> over<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.980> edge<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:14.239> if<00:03:14.390> I

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
arm kinda goes over the edge and if I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.660 
arm kinda goes over the edge and if I
know<00:03:15.469> we'll<00:03:15.950> go<00:03:16.159> over<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.430> edge<00:03:16.489> no<00:03:16.640> matter

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
know we'll go over the edge no matter

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:33.460 
know we'll go over the edge no matter
what<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:19.090> fetal<00:03:20.090> position

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.900 

that<00:03:34.470> would<00:03:34.620> take<00:03:34.770> some<00:03:34.830> shifting<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.580> think<00:03:35.790> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
that would take some shifting I think to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.380 
that would take some shifting I think to
get<00:03:36.120> into<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> fetal<00:03:36.750> position<00:03:36.870> comfortably

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390
