00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 good guys 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 We are going to present my 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.650
 mobil 1 refrigerator 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.970
 it is a very compact model, not even 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:26.670
 with measures of 31 centimeters and a half 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 height 28 centimeters wide and one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.850
 weight of 3.3 kilograms 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 its capacity is 5 liters give a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 varied in the inner space is that it is a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.379
 big question about who buys this model 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.730
 because it is very difficult to find images 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.940
 available from the inside of my 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.190
 nÃ© then only for the purpose of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 test here remembering that this practice 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.530
 It was when you buy yourself loose, and you? 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.689
 fits in that little shelf here that makes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.479
 the division is the manufacturer he passes us 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 information that fit eight cans just right 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.299
 for testing purposes here we go 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.020
 put four acts here in the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:29.159
 down that will not give us the certainty 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 that really fit the 8 atlas, right? 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 as the manufacturer promises four 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.810
 athletes on the bottom but four 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 cans up here you can close here 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 a locking system here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.770
 You can actually see eight 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.860
 cans ne 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 eight cans or two cans and some more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.299
 items anyway this is going to interest the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.630
 each one is a very refrigerator girl 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 very portable compact is ideal for 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.149
 Small environments for what is my case 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.960
 We bought this same refrigerator with the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.840
 intention of putting it not with 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.840
 when of only five meters 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.330
 squares or so it would not have 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 need to put a minibar 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 conventional 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.940
 ok the back of my refrigerator 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.610
 huh 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.930
 it comes here logically with this cable 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 power supply that is connected 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:46.300
 here and here she comes with the keys 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.060
 here it is in the off mode 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.930
 huh 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.490
 we have this key you position the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.470
 down key 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:02.350
 you would have the option to freeze and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.350
 positioning the switch up 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.630
 the option to warm up is that it is a 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.100
 differential of this apparatus is also 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.270
 according to manufacturer you can 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 reach the temperature of 65 degrees 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.180
 Celsius 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.500
 in this function it is hot in function here 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.100
 cold 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.640
 the manufacturer it promises a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.230
 refrigeration of 20 degrees below 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.290
 good ambient temperature still excited 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.280
 it also accompanies a 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.060
 cable in a car in vehicle adaptation 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.310
 person in the case to make an installation of the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.710
 product on your vehicle or just 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.860
 stressing here again is very compact the 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:02.010
 model 31cm and a half height 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.770
 twenty-eight in width and the weight of 3.3 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.930
 kilograms 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.400
 I hope everyone likes the model and who 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.400
 strong that it makes a good profit
