00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.509
 kind of raspberry 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 so firm enough 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.419
 here we have the chestnut cream it's a fact 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.810
 support his plate 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 monaco did not receive it 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.340
 a crushed sound in the parks 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.760
 to avoid throwing them away 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 after these two men 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 it is that the lull gelatin 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.260
 recipes side texture 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 it is necessary that the raspberries 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 screening on you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 to hold another without an ice bike 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 if it is a change of reception structure, porcelain 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 which makes the ice cream clean 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 rhubarb is too vast 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 so it's a reassuring voice guitar game 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 here we missed sticky bodies 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 good that it bats chocolate 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.420
 why are we following the crystallization curve of chocolate stewards have 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.280
 caught my eyes on that one shot 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 so filiform like this 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 it rises in uncertain temperature 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 george sarre neighborhood labor force 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 we can find that I am better right ladies confused 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.400
 to note that a brother at tain-l'hermitage valleraugue 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520
 of passage in valencia 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.950
 it's the best tricolor that exists in France 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.020
 we can find them at cd site 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 it is necessary for individuals not hesitated to see them in concert m 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 we have a little person and hip 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.160
 so it's a short pastry dough but is to say 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.310
 we make the green whiten 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 it does not make it scary 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 a word on the plan approved all the games 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 but it's not enough 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.669
 a cookie cutter 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.059
 to enslave 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.079
 to the earth 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.929
 therefore to three-basins 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 we'll talk to you again 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.759
 so we counted it's a little bit 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.759
 to support a little heating the raspberry 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.159
 to have one and six places 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 to add a little bit hard for me it's not sir 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.999
 Marc little bit 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 to pock a cream caramel his host 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.069
 we are 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.539
 the chocolate disc tablets 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.759
 morgenthau anger 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 we had observed the burst 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.609
 and here we come 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 all on it and we will return very gently 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.929
 it gives an appearance 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.189
 so we have deep oise 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.269
 she's a pipette 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.269
 we will fill the shot the neighbor japan 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.830
 apparently this message 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 I want to see rhubarb 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.930
 poisoning 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.520
 so that allows for him 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.520
 the restorer for service and make life easier 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.909
 nan but impossible to believe yet 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:16.309
 we can not be our place 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.849
 rather also 8% 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.309
 but what does it matter 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.309
 so I'm here for the prosecution 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:09.650
 by 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 in the schengen space 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.539
 and finally the jaws 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.919
 so with a silver spoon 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.919
 why he makes money because that 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.610
 the color mahajanga be shown children were dancing through the movie 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.610
 7sur7 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:36.439
 that's the sweet cocoa pleasure
