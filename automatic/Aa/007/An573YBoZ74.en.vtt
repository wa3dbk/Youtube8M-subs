00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 simplifying the biggest flaws 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.600

 look for materials 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 We will use the materials of 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.840
 so 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.180

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.500
 what are the old panel the original 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.630

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.220
 material look when you wanted the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.460
 san juan schools of san neighborhood 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.460
 Juan 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.400
 on the Estella road that is called 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.760
 everyone breathed 12 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.760
 there was a kiliki in the schools and from 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.490
 then I was in a parochial center that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 we had there in the portfolio of the analyzes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 we refer to the corpus parish 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.170
 christi and we became some giants with 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.630
 12-13 years and precisely with an exit 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.909
 of those giants was rigorist a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 marine christi who decided for the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.509
 indycar that as then I would sign everything 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.700
 the world all that shown by 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.170
 we say for your love by the hands of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.170
 mirrors this what they brought us 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.810
 and here is still about the year 78 and 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.179
 had happened at the time of if we care 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 I have to go to the dressmaker who was 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.420
 with the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 good today is June 26 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.340
 It would be quite advanced 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 and there are always last minute things 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 already the preparations go forward 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.030
 today we have one of the last months and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.810
 the last of the last trial with giants 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.880
 and on Monday or Tuesday we will start to dress 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.490
 and return that Tuesday because he's in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.180
 latency should the morning and still missing 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.850
 things are missing touch-ups on clothes and 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.850
 we'll have a little tighter at the end 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.750
 some retouching of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 tricorns the back of the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.090
 heads what are the faces is already 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 completed 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.290
 and there's always a new touch that does not come 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.239
 you've seen it and do it at the last minute 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.030
 we have always tried 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.180
 dosing the outputs not abused 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.220
 except for the 150th anniversary 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.010
 we went through all the neighborhoods but some 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.900
 years had to be done like this 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.079
 usually the rest of the years 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.980
 we try to get out as little as possible 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.379
 we try now 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.040
 City Hall is that he sends, of course, 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.159
 who are the owners have the figures 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.519
 but we believe that among other things 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.740
 This is also why we take care not to abuse 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.410
 of salt 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.360
 and it would end up tiring not in the end all 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.000
 the days with a kiliki the giants of 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.100
 the risks does not have its taste either 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.850
 special its flavors gets up to date 6 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 there are people and older people snob the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.300
 destríos that when the first 16 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.660
 accept goose bumps is true and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.920
 flights and sometimes we can see some 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.030
 photographs two next to some 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.470
 to an anecdote that has happened 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.660
 it's always interesting to see those 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.459
 Photographs 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.890
 For example, apply elízaga angel is not 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.870
 one of the criteria that accompany the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:28.370
 giants this man started in the year 47 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:33.139
 74 effect that did not come that does not come all 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 the days but his mandate did not design us 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.070
 it was not yet that on one occasion 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.660
 there was one that was a buzz uip the corn and 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 a friend of his was wearing one of the kilikis 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.040
 You do not have to leave me for a while 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.990
 to leave it behind in order to be the other 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.969
 that was very clever anciently but 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.729
 one day even in hospitals 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.169
 and left him that day says that by the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.020
 star wallet that was called then 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.460
 with 12 was lost 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.020
 and it appeared four o'clock in the afternoon 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.090
 in the house of the manager with the head 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.280
 start where you had to remove the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.840
 head is he the manager can you 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.340
 imagine that he was on nerves and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.160
 fidel green is another of the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.250
 Veterans of the Celts who stuck to 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.080
 Who the years that were so many were 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.180
 a man very well known in pamplona 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.710
 because he was also in the square 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.409
 bulls and on the football field and good 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.479
 I knew everyone 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.210
 and this is to go to this pay quite 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.590
 strong with the caldito 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.590
 son of a day we arrived towards san 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.250

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.840
 running he does not carry anyone in front and 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.689
 behind him a woman with the bag for 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.039
 hit him 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:42.559
 but so running that I had given him with 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:47.769
 the bladder and the wig had thrown 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.769
 woman and it sat like a clear kick 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.710
 good me although I am comfortable here 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.389
 seeing remembering things I will not leave 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.389
 because I also have to finish 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.770

 components of the comparsa and 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.140
 we will understand when we list how many people 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.170
 comes and how many people fail today that is a 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.580
 dangerous day if they used it in addition already 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.180
 we will see 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.110
