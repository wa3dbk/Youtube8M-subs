on<00:00:53.520> ground<00:00:53.670> which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.120> probably<00:00:54.449> plenty<00:00:54.690> quick

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
on ground which is probably plenty quick

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
on ground which is probably plenty quick
and<00:00:55.230> offer<00:00:55.350> she<00:00:56.250> likes<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.699> her<00:00:56.820> toe<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> a

and offer she likes to get her toe in a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
and offer she likes to get her toe in a
bit<00:00:57.510> she<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.440> haven't<00:00:58.739> seen<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.340> that's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bit she we haven't seen or much that's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
bit she we haven't seen or much that's
the<00:01:00.090> concern<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.350> seen<00:01:01.500> her<00:01:01.590> since

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the concern would not seen her since

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
the concern would not seen her since
this<00:01:01.920> run<00:01:02.160> hopefully<00:01:02.340> no<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this run hopefully no and that is the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
this run hopefully no and that is the
concern<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.920> didn't<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.339> Claire<00:01:05.549> Vega

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
concern but we didn't see Claire Vega

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
concern but we didn't see Claire Vega
much<00:01:06.000> either<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.570> she<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.560> enough<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
much either and she was good enough to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.260 
much either and she was good enough to
come<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:08.070> away<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.880> her

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
come back away and I think her

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
come back away and I think her
superiority<00:01:09.990> over<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.920> others<00:01:11.220> allows<00:01:11.970> her<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
superiority over the others allows her a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
superiority over the others allows her a
little<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> leeway<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:14.070> for

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
little bit of leeway and I think for

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
little bit of leeway and I think for
that<00:01:14.250> reason<00:01:14.369> she's<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> tough

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that reason she's going to be a tough

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
that reason she's going to be a tough
nut<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> crack<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.409> she's<00:01:16.619> 162<00:01:17.430> rated<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
nut to crack yeah she's 162 rated I just

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
nut to crack yeah she's 162 rated I just
want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> make<00:01:18.509> though<00:01:18.689> whether<00:01:18.900> they're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
want to make though whether they're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.749 
want to make though whether they're
coming<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.009> race<00:01:20.250> having<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.640> an
