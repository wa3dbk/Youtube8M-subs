00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
life something that an artist really

life something that an artist really
cannot<00:00:40.030> see<00:00:40.360> there<00:00:40.810> must<00:00:41.050> be<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.230> way<00:00:41.500> to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
cannot see there must be a way to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.430 
cannot see there must be a way to
actually<00:00:42.040> get<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.790> colors<00:00:43.300> accurate<00:00:44.080> with

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
mechanical means I propped up a small

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.640 
mechanical means I propped up a small
mirror<00:00:48.190> at<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.400> 45-degree<00:00:49.270> angle<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:50.440> on<00:00:50.590> the

the<00:00:53.230> cow<00:00:53.470> took<00:00:54.100> me<00:00:54.190> about<00:00:54.340> half<00:00:54.580> an<00:00:54.700> hour<00:00:54.820> to

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
the cow took me about half an hour to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.790 
the cow took me about half an hour to
learn<00:00:55.090> how<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.300> operate<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.870> paintbrush<00:00:56.350> good

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
learn how to operate a paintbrush good

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.780 
learn how to operate a paintbrush good
for<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.070> took<00:00:57.280> me<00:00:57.460> 40<00:00:57.790> years<00:00:59.010> it's<00:01:00.010> possible

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
for you took me 40 years it's possible

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.000 
for you took me 40 years it's possible
that<00:01:01.090> he<00:01:01.480> was<00:01:01.750> more<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.260> tinkerer<00:01:02.680> or<00:01:02.830> more

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
that he was more of a tinkerer or more

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.280 
that he was more of a tinkerer or more
of<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.340> geek<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.659> way<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:04.839> feel<00:01:05.229> a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
of a geek and in that way I feel a

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.190 
of a geek and in that way I feel a
kinship<00:01:05.830> with<00:01:05.890> him<00:01:06.189> so<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.549> had<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:07.119> construct<00:01:07.659> a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
kinship with him so I had to construct a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.770 
kinship with him so I had to construct a
replica<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.159> exact<00:01:09.579> room<00:01:09.850> where<00:01:10.240> room<00:01:10.600> air

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
replica of the exact room where room air

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.140 
replica of the exact room where room air
painted<00:01:11.200> went<00:01:11.619> right<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.100> harpsichord<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
painted went right the harpsichord the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
painted went right the harpsichord the
Spanish<00:01:13.540> chair<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.960> viola<00:01:14.230> da<00:01:14.350> gamba<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:15.130> rug

the<00:01:17.910> winds<00:01:18.150> trying<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.420> blow<00:01:18.480> my<00:01:18.660> shape<00:01:19.260> well

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the winds trying to blow my shape well

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.180 
the winds trying to blow my shape well
this<00:01:20.490> certainly<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.940> not<00:01:21.300> easy

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.000 

this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.270> ingenious<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
this is very ingenious that's where the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.670 
this is very ingenious that's where the
painting<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.430> Buckingham<00:01:32.850> Palace

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.800 

using<00:01:36.430> Tim's<00:01:36.670> device<00:01:36.850> you've<00:01:37.420> become<00:01:37.750> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
using Tim's device you've become a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.930 
using Tim's device you've become a
machine<00:01:38.260> I'm<00:01:38.590> proposing<00:01:39.340> an<00:01:39.400> alternate

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
machine I'm proposing an alternate

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.090 
machine I'm proposing an alternate
history<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.600> Vermeer<00:01:40.990> was<00:01:41.290> familiar<00:01:41.470> machine

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
history of Vermeer was familiar machine

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.600 
history of Vermeer was familiar machine
oh<00:01:42.340> my<00:01:43.270> god<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:44.020> think<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.470> my<00:01:44.620> step<00:01:45.190> caught<00:01:45.580> a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
oh my god I think in my step caught a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.080 
oh my god I think in my step caught a
lot<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.030> people<00:01:49.980> we<00:01:50.980> were<00:01:51.130> making<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.520> film<00:01:51.550> when

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
lot of people we were making a film when

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.900 
lot of people we were making a film when
I<00:01:52.150> quit<00:01:52.480> yeah<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.720> definitely<00:01:52.900> would<00:01:53.700> yeah<00:01:54.730> I

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
I quit yeah I definitely would yeah I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.010 
I quit yeah I definitely would yeah I
would<00:01:55.150> find<00:01:55.360> something<00:01:55.660> else<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.990> right

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
would find something else to do right

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.990 
would find something else to do right
now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.060 

you
