may align this back successfully and we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
may align this back successfully and we
can<00:00:54.929> continue<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:55.589> way<00:00:56.000> there<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.120> a

chance on any bending it may fail and
that<00:01:00.329> would<00:01:00.479> simply<00:01:00.839> be<00:01:00.890> breaking<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.719> but

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
crash that got a little bit loose so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.449 
crash that got a little bit loose so
Snug<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.539> back<00:01:33.959> up<00:01:34.200> before<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.740> proceed<00:01:35.220> now

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
Snug that back up before we proceed now

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.639 
Snug that back up before we proceed now
I'm<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> straighten<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.929> tool<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
I'm going to straighten the tool out and

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.219 
I'm going to straighten the tool out and
use<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.069> as<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> lever<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> grab

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
use it as a lever so we're going to grab

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.779 
use it as a lever so we're going to grab
the<00:01:40.560> tool<00:01:40.799> grab<00:01:41.700> inside<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.390> body<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the tool grab inside the body here and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.190 
the tool grab inside the body here and
pull<00:01:45.020> pain<00:01:46.100> boom<00:01:47.479> we're<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:49.080> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pull pain boom we're a little better I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.770 
pull pain boom we're a little better I
think<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.590> need<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.830> go<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.780> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think we need to go a little bit more so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.510 
think we need to go a little bit more so
we<00:01:51.930> continue

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we continue

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.649 
we continue
to<00:01:54.060> pull<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.820> cog<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
to pull back we want to get the cog the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.529 
to pull back we want to get the cog the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
parallel with one another then we will

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.259 
parallel with one another then we will
reset<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> limit<00:02:07.289> screws<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.000> set

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
reset the limit screws and then we set

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.209 
reset the limit screws and then we set
our<00:02:09.420> indexing<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:11.009> hopefully<00:02:11.430> carry<00:02:12.000> on
