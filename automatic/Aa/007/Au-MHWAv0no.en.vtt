00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
they're duct-taped together that was my

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890 
they're duct-taped together that was my
secret<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.220> making<00:00:23.369> them<00:00:23.580> last<00:00:23.820> longer<00:00:24.180> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
together would be ridiculously heavy so

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
together would be ridiculously heavy so
it<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.220> sort<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> annoying<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.090> mean<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.570> know

actually got this pair of a head
aluminum<00:00:43.230> drumsticks<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:46.200> weary<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
aluminum drumsticks and I was weary of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
aluminum drumsticks and I was weary of
aluminum<00:00:47.129> drumsticks<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.629> heard

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
aluminum drumsticks just because I heard

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.860 
aluminum drumsticks just because I heard
that<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> easily<00:00:49.559> break<00:00:50.039> cymbals<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
that they can easily break cymbals and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.150 
that they can easily break cymbals and
things<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.770> they're<00:00:52.949> really

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
things like that because they're really

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
things like that because they're really
really<00:00:53.309> rock<00:00:53.760> solid<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> pair<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
really rock solid but the pair that I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
really rock solid but the pair that I
got<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.730> aluminum<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> bottom

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
got is actually aluminum at the bottom

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
got is actually aluminum at the bottom
part<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.370> bottom<00:00:59.579> half<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.559> hear<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
part the bottom half you can hear that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.000 
part the bottom half you can hear that
and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.460> sort<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> plastic<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.799> hard

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and then sort of a plastic really hard

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
and then sort of a plastic really hard
plastic<00:01:05.580> molded<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> top<00:01:06.799> if<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> can

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
plastic molded at the top if you can

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.330 
plastic molded at the top if you can
hear<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.590> easily<00:01:10.860> be

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hear that and this can easily be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
hear that and this can easily be
replaced<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.970> plastic<00:01:12.540> portion<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.770> ever

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
replaced the plastic portion if it ever

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.010 
replaced the plastic portion if it ever
breaks<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.060> thought<00:01:15.270> okay<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.689> know<00:01:15.869> what

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
breaks and I thought okay you know what

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
breaks and I thought okay you know what
it<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:16.229> last<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.650> month<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.009> might<00:01:17.130> last<00:01:17.280> me

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it might last a month it might last me

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.420 
it might last a month it might last me
two<00:01:17.670> months<00:01:18.000> before<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.479> bring<00:01:18.770> but<00:01:19.770> I've

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
two months before they bring but I've

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.120 
two months before they bring but I've
had<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:20.909> over<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:22.080> month<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> half<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
had them for over a month and a half and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
had them for over a month and a half and
I've<00:01:23.250> been<00:01:23.369> playing<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.570> hard<00:01:25.170> on

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I've been playing really really hard on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
I've been playing really really hard on
the<00:01:25.470> cymbals<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.920> drums<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.030> yet

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the cymbals and drums and they have yet

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
the cymbals and drums and they have yet
to<00:01:27.270> even<00:01:27.780> dent<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.500> mean<00:01:29.070> they're<00:01:29.189> marked<00:01:29.490> up

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to even dent I mean they're marked up

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
to even dent I mean they're marked up
but<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.320> last<00:01:31.650> three<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
but I think these would last three to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.330 
but I think these would last three to
four<00:01:32.790> years<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.540> heavy<00:01:34.229> playing<00:01:34.619> before<00:01:35.040> even

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
four years of heavy playing before even

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.359 
four years of heavy playing before even
breaking<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.360> mean<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.290> smash<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.890> symbol

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
breaking I mean you can smash a symbol

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.800 
breaking I mean you can smash a symbol
as

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.810 

completely<00:01:41.810> dead<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.189> thinnest<00:01:43.610> part

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
completely dead on to the thinnest part

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.520 
completely dead on to the thinnest part
of<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:43.970> symbol<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.869> doesn't<00:01:45.170> even<00:01:45.200> leave

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
of the symbol and it doesn't even leave

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.090 
of the symbol and it doesn't even leave
a<00:01:45.560> mark

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
a mark

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.420 
a mark
they're<00:01:46.640> amazing<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:47.360> would<00:01:47.840> highly<00:01:48.290> recommend

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
they're amazing I would highly recommend

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.570 
they're amazing I would highly recommend
