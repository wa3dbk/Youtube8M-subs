00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 in the gold nyamwasa residence of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 France in Tel Aviv 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.340
 sir christophe bigot we are 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.840
 together today to prepare the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.840
 recipe of the galette des rois 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.260
 so to start this recipe we 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.000
 let's do the frangipane so that is 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.040
 the prank of the galette des rois 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.250
 so for this one we need to 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.080
 100g soft butter that we 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.640
 put in a cul-de-poule or in a 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:12.790
 bowl 100 g almond powder and 100 g 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.790
 sugar 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.439
 and then using a whip we 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
 let's go work the ointment butter with 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.229
 these three ingredients we are going 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.310
 corpore the egg yolks one by one I 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.990
 advocates breaking the eggs in a 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.109
 bowl to be able to look if there is no 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.270
 shell and then add another 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.640
 preparation 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.990
 here is an egg so and then we 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.549
 let's add a second offer so 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.200
 when we finished this process there 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.090
 so you can add the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.789
 ingredients you want 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.369
 I like or add vanilla 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.369
 Freche is a little rum 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.280
 so we have the frangipane that is 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.000
 true in the fridge now we're going 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 switch to puff pastry 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.590
 then using a circle or or a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.190
 bowl a little smaller than the width of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 the puff pastry 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.660
 we're going to make a notch on the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:40.130
 dough we're going to gild the outline with a 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.420
 egg yolk so then when you 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.830
 have your puff pastry golden all 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.450
 around we will proceed to lower 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.450
 frangipane almond paste 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.220
 we lowered the almond cream on 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.730
 puff pastry the first one based on 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.190
 puff pastry 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.000
 we will now put the bean 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.610
 in in the marzipan like these 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.910
 and we will cover it slightly with 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.010
 almond cream so then we go 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.260
 prepare the second dough-based 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.890
 flaky then put it on top and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.200
 cover it with gilding 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.709
 so the second disc on the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.130
 frangipane so with the fingers we 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.130
 let's go slowly close the edges 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.700
 so yes we will cut with the same 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.700
 disc with the same diameter as 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 previously 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.480
 so then with a cookie cutter we go 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.300
 cut slightly all around the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:09.220
 slab for can have a pretty shape 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:11.650
 alveolar so we sang the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.980
 King's galette tour 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.980
 we will then give generously 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.410
 the cake is removed from the fridge 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.169
 the rest you can see that the yellow 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.580
 of egg with the puff pastry and 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.800
 so now we will add a 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.800
 second layer of egg yolk 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.320
 we will find the center of the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.130
 slab of kings to have a point of 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.950
 landmark to make the rosette and also 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:58.930
 to allow the evacuation of steam 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:05:00.940
 of water here is the galette des rois which is 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:10.450
 ready to freeze the sets we have more 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:14.580
 than the day so I leave you on 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.580
 these few words and good tasting
