00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.020 

that's<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.319> mistake<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.800> space

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.650 

mmm<00:00:10.030> me<00:00:10.330> losing<00:00:10.540> those<00:00:10.780> was<00:00:10.990> pretty<00:00:11.230> bad

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
mmm me losing those was pretty bad

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.000 
mmm me losing those was pretty bad
especially<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.590> lose<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> hatch<00:00:14.010> too

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
especially when I lose the hatch too

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.380 
especially when I lose the hatch too
that's<00:00:17.010> why<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.220> maps<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:18.000> hard<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that's why this maps really hard in this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:33.190 
that's why this maps really hard in this
position

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.220 

I<00:00:34.910> always<00:00:35.910> trying<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> move<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I always trying to move out kind of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:01:41.830 
I always trying to move out kind of
weird

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:02:29.450 

mineral<00:01:42.840> field<00:01:43.200> decay<00:01:44.070> that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.920 

mmm<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.720> not<00:02:30.900> much<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.380> do<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:33.650> hmm<00:02:35.930> snap

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
mmm just not much I can do here hmm snap

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:54.720 
mmm just not much I can do here hmm snap
can<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.500> difficult<00:02:38.540> really<00:02:39.540> difficult

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.520 

if<00:02:55.420> our<00:02:55.629> places<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.050> could<00:02:56.110> have<00:02:56.319> played<00:02:56.440> it

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
if our places I could have played it

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.729 
if our places I could have played it
better<00:02:56.800> but<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:58.170> inherently<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.560> hard

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
better but just inherently really hard

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.589 
better but just inherently really hard
positions<00:03:00.159> like<00:03:00.700> obviously<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.299> messed<00:03:01.480> up

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
positions like obviously I messed up

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.280 
positions like obviously I messed up
here<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:03.430> like<00:03:04.239> before<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.900> there's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
here that's like before this there's

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.250 
here that's like before this there's
just<00:03:05.970> point<00:03:06.970> where<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.390> holding<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.049> base

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
just point where like holding that base

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.080 
just point where like holding that base
over<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.340> hard<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.610> deal<00:03:09.819> with<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
over there it's so hard to deal with the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.960 
over there it's so hard to deal with the
targets<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:10.629> basis<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:14.610> mm-hmm<00:03:15.610> not

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
targets do basis I think mm-hmm not

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.289 
targets do basis I think mm-hmm not
quite<00:03:16.150> sure<00:03:17.580> maybe<00:03:18.580> just<00:03:18.760> not<00:03:18.790> even<00:03:19.090> going

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
quite sure maybe just not even going

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.259 
quite sure maybe just not even going
meet<00:03:19.420> us<00:03:19.569> just<00:03:20.140> pure<00:03:20.440> ground<00:03:21.010> army<00:03:21.310> has

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
meet us just pure ground army has

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.500 
meet us just pure ground army has
potential<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.290> map<00:03:27.090> hey<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> said<00:03:28.239> not

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
potential on this map hey I said not

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:52.360 
potential on this map hey I said not
really<00:03:28.599> sure<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:32.170> I<00:03:32.200> put<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.560> fairly<00:03:32.769> low

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.850 

let's<00:03:53.370> see<00:03:56.180> looking<00:03:57.180> over<00:03:57.330> his<00:03:57.510> production

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
let's see looking over his production

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.260 
let's see looking over his production
that's<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.640> first<00:04:00.670> step<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.210> getting

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
that's just the first step in getting

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.750 
that's just the first step in getting
over<00:04:01.600> his<00:04:01.690> production<00:04:05.310> pretty<00:04:06.310> much<00:04:06.430> her<00:04:06.580> only

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
over his production pretty much her only

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.310 
over his production pretty much her only
shot<00:04:06.880> at<00:04:07.210> this<00:04:07.300> point<00:04:07.600> let's<00:04:07.840> get<00:04:08.050> over<00:04:08.110> there

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
shot at this point let's get over there

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.140 
shot at this point let's get over there
production

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.030 

I<00:04:12.299> don't<00:04:12.870> have<00:04:12.930> quite<00:04:13.110> enough<00:04:13.200> links<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.799> do<00:04:13.920> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I don't have quite enough links to do it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:25.430 
I don't have quite enough links to do it
I<00:04:18.139> don't<00:04:19.139> think

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.020 

like<00:04:26.440> just<00:04:26.710> too<00:04:27.160> much<00:04:27.310> production

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
like just too much production

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:39.190 
like just too much production
I<00:04:29.950> can't<00:04:30.950> do<00:04:31.040> a<00:04:31.070> piss<00:04:31.720> why<00:04:37.840> it's<00:04:38.840> just<00:04:38.900> killing
