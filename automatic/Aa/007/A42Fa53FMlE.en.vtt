00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
let's create a eighty twenty millimeter

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.950 
let's create a eighty twenty millimeter
by<00:01:38.420> eighty<00:01:39.420> twenty<00:01:40.079> millimeter<00:01:40.920> okay<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
by eighty twenty millimeter okay so this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
by eighty twenty millimeter okay so this
year's<00:01:44.420> series<00:01:47.930> right<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.110> correct<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
year's series right it's correct so this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
year's series right it's correct so this
will<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:52.670> C<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.259> 25<00:01:55.369> 24<00:01:56.369> 25<00:01:57.979> millimeter

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
will be C this one 25 24 25 millimeter

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:07.399 
will be C this one 25 24 25 millimeter
24<00:01:59.939> 25<00:02:00.540> meter<00:02:02.329> see<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:06.409> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
24 25 meter see there so this is the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.100 
24 25 meter see there so this is the
correct<00:02:07.770> size

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
correct size

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.390 
correct size
thank<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.740> for<00:02:09.890> watching<00:02:10.390> bye
