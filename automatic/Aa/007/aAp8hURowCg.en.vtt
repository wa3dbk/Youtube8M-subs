review<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.920> mean<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
review I mean and so as you can see it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
review I mean and so as you can see it
has<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.219> grip<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:04.049> very

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
has a little grip thing that is very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.160 
has a little grip thing that is very
grippy<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> guess<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:05.760> put<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
grippy I guess is how you could put it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
grippy I guess is how you could put it
and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> saw<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> logo

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.880 
and then as you saw there was the logo
right<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> says<00:01:10.290> trademark<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
don't you copy it and then it does get a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
don't you copy it and then it does get a
few<00:01:14.549> dents<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.360> hard<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.140> tough
