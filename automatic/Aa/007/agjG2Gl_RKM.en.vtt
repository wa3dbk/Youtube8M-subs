a little bit farther down like I did but

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.330 
a little bit farther down like I did but
no<00:02:59.430> worries<00:02:59.820> I'll<00:02:59.940> fix<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.270> later<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:02.190> that's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
no worries I'll fix it later so that's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.890 
no worries I'll fix it later so that's
what<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.550> looks<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.870> just

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
what it looks like and now I'm just

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:15.190 
what it looks like and now I'm just
gonna<00:03:04.080> go<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.680> cut<00:03:05.250> off<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.550> edges

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.780 

it's<00:03:15.349> not<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.770> edges<00:03:16.069> are<00:03:16.220> all<00:03:16.250> nice<00:03:16.550> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's not that the edges are all nice and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.250 
it's not that the edges are all nice and
cutting<00:03:17.120> pretty<00:03:17.560> put<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.800> um<00:03:19.670> as<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:21.080> I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
cutting pretty put a um as you can see I

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470 
cutting pretty put a um as you can see I
actually<00:03:21.530> stapled<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.459> whole<00:03:22.610> bunch<00:03:22.819> along<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
actually stapled a whole bunch along the

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.180 
actually stapled a whole bunch along the
top<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.870> one<00:03:24.050> don't<00:03:24.380> do<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.800> because<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
top of this one don't do that because it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
top of this one don't do that because it
makes<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:25.940> much<00:03:26.030> harder<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.480> rip<00:03:26.630> only<00:03:27.080> two

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
makes it so much harder to rip only two

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.150 
makes it so much harder to rip only two
staples<00:03:27.739> at<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.099> top<00:03:29.060> two<00:03:29.239> corners<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.680> now

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
staples at the top two corners so now

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.190 
staples at the top two corners so now
this<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.520> me<00:03:31.670> failing<00:03:32.270> at<00:03:32.480> ripping<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.080> out

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
this is me failing at ripping one out

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.500 
this is me failing at ripping one out
because<00:03:33.709> like<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.010> said<00:03:34.069> earlier<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.910> will<00:03:35.239> rip

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
because like I said earlier it will rip

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.350 
because like I said earlier it will rip
the<00:03:35.690> whole<00:03:35.900> entire<00:03:36.260> blotting<00:03:37.160> paper<00:03:37.370> so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
the whole entire blotting paper so

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.280 
the whole entire blotting paper so
that's<00:03:38.600> not<00:03:38.780> good

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
that's not good

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.949 
that's not good
let<00:03:39.530> me<00:03:39.590> show<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.800> oh<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:46.000> yeah<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.360> tried<00:03:47.780> do

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
let me show you oh so yeah I tried do

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.180 
let me show you oh so yeah I tried do

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
two again but I'm just gonna cut this

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.920 
two again but I'm just gonna cut this
part<00:03:49.400> out<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.330> me<00:03:53.600> showing<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
part out and so it's just me showing you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.559 
part out and so it's just me showing you
that<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.739> have<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:54.950> get<00:03:55.069> closer<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.610> not<00:03:56.330> that

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
that you have to get closer up not that

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.759 
that you have to get closer up not that
one<00:03:56.720> but<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.799> one<00:03:58.190> has<00:03:58.819> good<00:03:59.000> staples<00:03:59.769> so

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
one but this one has good staples so

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.229 
one but this one has good staples so
this<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.100> me<00:04:01.190> ripping<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.610> out<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> good

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
this is me ripping it out of the good

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.610 
this is me ripping it out of the good
one<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:04.700> nice<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.330> neat<00:04:05.660> pretty<00:04:06.200> neat<00:04:06.410> I

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
one and it's nice and neat pretty neat I

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.400 
one and it's nice and neat pretty neat I
I<00:04:07.160> guess<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.150> now<00:04:08.569> just<00:04:08.840> kind<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.049> blot<00:04:09.290> it

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
I guess and now just kind of blot it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.720 
I guess and now just kind of blot it
along<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> face<00:04:09.950> that's<00:04:10.190> kind<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.459> why<00:04:10.580> it's

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
along the face that's kind of why it's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.650 
along the face that's kind of why it's
called<00:04:10.850> blotting<00:04:11.209> paper<00:04:11.890> also<00:04:13.239> don't<00:04:14.239> do<00:04:14.480> that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
don't just kind of barely tap it because

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.610 
don't just kind of barely tap it because
it<00:04:16.729> won't<00:04:16.910> get<00:04:17.150> any<00:04:17.209> oil<00:04:17.630> on<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.049> but<00:04:18.260> just<00:04:18.290> kind
