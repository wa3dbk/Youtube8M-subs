if<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.460> want<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> go<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.170> five<00:00:10.170> degrees<00:00:10.590> up

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
if I want to go that five degrees up

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.250 
if I want to go that five degrees up
like<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.130> David<00:00:11.460> I'm<00:00:11.910> gonna<00:00:12.090> hold<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.020> site

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
like that David I'm gonna hold the site

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.110 
like that David I'm gonna hold the site
sacrum<00:00:13.770> and<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> site<00:00:14.250> stick<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.639> only<00:00:14.940> with

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
sacrum and the site stick here only with

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.390 
sacrum and the site stick here only with
the<00:00:15.240> finger<00:00:15.600> just<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.199> show<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:17.010> kind<00:00:17.250> of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the finger just to show the kind of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.840 
the finger just to show the kind of
inputs<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.590> pilot<00:00:19.920> actually<00:00:20.100> has<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.670> do

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
inputs that the pilot actually has to do

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.420 
inputs that the pilot actually has to do
so<00:00:21.060> I'll<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.390> push<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.440> a<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:22.710> bit<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
so I'll just push over a little bit and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.300 
so I'll just push over a little bit and
release<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.599> I<00:00:25.050> feel<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.189> little

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
release and I feel that it's a little

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.150 
release and I feel that it's a little
bit<00:00:26.460> below<00:00:26.759> five<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> give<00:00:28.080> another<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.890> put

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
bit below five so I give another you put

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.739 
bit below five so I give another you put
in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> other<00:00:29.669> direction<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.329> this<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.539> how

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
in the other direction and this is how

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.930 
in the other direction and this is how
we<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.259> small<00:00:31.560> inputs<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.700> rest

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we do the small inputs and the rest

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.480 
we do the small inputs and the rest
that's<00:00:33.480> fly<00:00:33.690> by<00:00:33.870> wire<00:00:34.050> works<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.190> pilot

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
that's fly by wire works the pilot

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.670 
that's fly by wire works the pilot
doesn't<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> constantly<00:00:36.810> be<00:00:36.930> bolded

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
doesn't have to constantly be bolded

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.790 
doesn't have to constantly be bolded
because<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.370> won't<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.820> leaving<00:00:39.750> whatever<00:00:40.560> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because it won't be leaving whatever you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.720 
because it won't be leaving whatever you
selected<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:43.730> capturing

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
selected and also the capturing

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
selected and also the capturing
capturing<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:47.690> do<00:00:48.690> flight<00:00:48.990> path<00:00:49.230> vehicles

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
capturing you do flight path vehicles

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
capturing you do flight path vehicles
are<00:00:49.830> also<00:00:50.130> are<00:00:50.400> very<00:00:50.430> simple<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
are also are very simple and the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.940 
are also are very simple and the
airplane<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.290> goes<00:00:52.650> through<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
airplane also goes through a

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.100 
airplane also goes through a
certification<00:00:53.460> process<00:00:54.060> in<00:00:54.450> which<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.870> have

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
certification process in which we have

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.260 
certification process in which we have
to<00:00:55.260> demonstrate<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:57.350> free<00:00:58.350> of

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.070 

oscillations<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.880> level<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.600> here

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.210 

and<00:01:11.080> put<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.680> over<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:12.070> horizon<00:01:12.610> line<00:01:12.870> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and put it over the horizon line and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.740 
and put it over the horizon line and
we've<00:01:15.220> got<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.460> level<00:01:15.760> one<00:01:16.270> interesting<00:01:16.720> thing

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
we've got a level one interesting thing

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.020 
we've got a level one interesting thing
that<00:01:16.930> we<00:01:17.170> already<00:01:17.320> have<00:01:17.680> fun<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.100> 170<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:18.940> I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
that we already have fun to 170 and I

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.490 
that we already have fun to 170 and I
like<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.300> lot<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.750> flight<00:01:23.260> path

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
like a lot but it's the flight path

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.090 
like a lot but it's the flight path
angle<00:01:24.720> indication<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.900> think<00:01:25.990> it's<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.710> lot

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
angle indication I think it's a lot

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.030 
angle indication I think it's a lot
better<00:01:27.310> flying<00:01:27.790> with<00:01:28.120> this<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.920> trying<00:01:29.920> to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
better flying with this and trying to

the<00:02:34.110> level<00:02:34.260> flight<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.780> at<00:02:37.080> any<00:02:37.260> point<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.890> I'm

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the level flight and at any point if I'm

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.789 
the level flight and at any point if I'm
above<00:02:38.849> 33<00:02:39.299> degrees<00:02:39.599> at<00:02:39.750> least<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.260> side<00:02:40.500> stick

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
above 33 degrees at least the side stick

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.640 
above 33 degrees at least the side stick
somebody<00:02:41.040> asked<00:02:41.549> about<00:02:41.660> if<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:42.900> preloaded

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
somebody asked about if it's preloaded

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.720 
somebody asked about if it's preloaded
to<00:02:43.769> notary

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
to notary

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
to notary
so<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.299> always<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.709> always

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so it always so I have to do is always

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.660 
so it always so I have to do is always
release<00:02:47.579> besides<00:02:48.090> things<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:48.900> easy

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
release besides things it's really easy

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.160 
release besides things it's really easy
turn<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.060> level<00:02:51.390> flight<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.780> bring<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
turn back to level flight you bring it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.729 
turn back to level flight you bring it
really<00:02:52.470> quick<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.310> release<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.480> release<00:02:55.290> new

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
really quick and release and release new

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.080 
really quick and release and release new
super<00:02:56.069> small<00:02:56.430> inputs<00:02:59.930> another<00:03:00.930> thing<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.440> also

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
super small inputs another thing is also

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.410 
super small inputs another thing is also
talked<00:03:03.090> about<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.739> if<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.950> want<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.489> in

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
talked about is that if I want to in

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.740 
talked about is that if I want to in
this<00:03:06.599> situation<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:07.950> example<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:09.060> roll

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
this situation for example I can roll

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.489 
this situation for example I can roll
the<00:03:09.959> plane<00:03:10.200> all<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.799> way

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:17.499 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.979 

we<00:03:18.499> don't<00:03:18.680> consider<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.640> by<00:03:19.999> itself<00:03:20.480> is

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
we don't consider that this by itself is

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.800 
we don't consider that this by itself is
something<00:03:21.590> dangerous<00:03:21.909> but<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:23.030> course<00:03:23.299> if<00:03:23.629> I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
something dangerous but of course if I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.599 
something dangerous but of course if I
go<00:03:24.049> into<00:03:24.379> high<00:03:24.590> speed<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.219> I'll<00:03:25.340> show<00:03:25.579> you

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
go into high speed and I'll show you

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:26.289 
go into high speed and I'll show you
later

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
later

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.709 
later
if<00:03:26.689> I<00:03:26.900> go<00:03:27.079> into<00:03:27.290> high<00:03:27.590> speed<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.189> can't<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:28.939> that

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:31.719 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.550 

since<00:03:32.719> since<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:33.200> plane<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.969> protects<00:03:34.969> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
since since the plane it protects the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.199 
since since the plane it protects the
fly-by-wire<00:03:36.560> particular<00:03:37.370> thing<00:03:37.639> from<00:03:37.969> my

fly-by-wire particular thing from my

fly-by-wire particular thing from my

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
speech it has to be able to pitch up and

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.559 
speech it has to be able to pitch up and
took<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.139> Chuck<00:03:42.379> we<00:03:42.620> need<00:03:42.829> at<00:03:43.040> least<00:03:43.540> close<00:03:44.540> to

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
took the Chuck we need at least close to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.050 
took the Chuck we need at least close to
weak<00:03:45.019> level<00:03:45.439> situation<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.249> if<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.669> go<00:03:46.730> not

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
weak level situation so if I go not

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.940 
weak level situation so if I go not
mighty<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.749> return<00:03:48.139> there's<00:03:48.409> no<00:03:48.590> way<00:03:48.739> that

mighty that return there's no way that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.619 
mighty that return there's no way that
there's<00:03:49.129> we<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:49.549> protect<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:52.389> commands<00:03:53.389> a

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
there's we can protect the commands a

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.339 
there's we can protect the commands a
roll<00:03:53.840> towards<00:03:54.379> when<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:54.829> level<00:03:56.049> even<00:03:57.049> if<00:03:57.199> I'm

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
roll towards when it's level even if I'm

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.420 
roll towards when it's level even if I'm
trying<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.709> hold<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.849> other<00:03:58.969> direction

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
trying to hold it in the other direction

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.280 
trying to hold it in the other direction
it's<00:04:01.430> like<00:04:01.609> in<00:04:01.969> this<00:04:02.150> situation<00:04:02.329> here<00:04:03.019> for

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
it's like in this situation here for

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.039 
it's like in this situation here for
example<00:04:03.769> there's<00:04:04.669> an<00:04:04.879> airplane<00:04:05.629> right<00:04:05.900> in

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
example there's an airplane right in

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.890 
example there's an airplane right in
front<00:04:06.319> of<00:04:06.439> me<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> glider<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.159> all<00:04:07.639> but<00:04:07.879> I<00:04:08.090> can

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
front of me a glider and all but I can

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.659 
front of me a glider and all but I can
react<00:04:09.230> just<00:04:09.439> pulling<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.980> back<00:04:11.680> all<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:13.549> way

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
react just pulling it back all the way

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.699 
react just pulling it back all the way
to<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.939> back<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.389> see<00:04:14.569> here<00:04:14.810> two<00:04:15.409> point

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
to the back and I see here two point

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.640 
to the back and I see here two point
four<00:04:16.009> G's<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.940> it's<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.690> maximum<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:18.440> two

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
four G's so it's the maximum is two

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.899 
four G's so it's the maximum is two
point<00:04:18.949> five<00:04:19.160> g's<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:21.470> plate<00:04:21.709> there<00:04:22.009> pilot

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
point five g's so the plate there pilot

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:27.760 
point five g's so the plate there pilot
doesn't<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:25.130> worried

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.670 

like<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.699> if<00:04:29.909> if<00:04:30.300> we<00:04:30.509> were<00:04:30.539> in<00:04:30.870> low-speed

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
like that and if if we were in low-speed

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.619 
like that and if if we were in low-speed
it's<00:04:32.069> the<00:04:32.280> same<00:04:32.490> thing<00:04:32.789> it'll<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.240> the

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
it's the same thing it'll be the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.809 
it's the same thing it'll be the
protected<00:04:34.199> from<00:04:34.379> from<00:04:34.979> load<00:04:35.879> factor<00:04:36.479> or<00:04:36.750> from

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
protected from from load factor or from

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.070 
protected from from load factor or from
since<00:04:38.819> I<00:04:38.909> talked<00:04:39.150> about<00:04:39.270> hi<00:04:39.689> speaks<00:04:40.139> a<00:04:42.080> little

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
since I talked about hi speaks a little

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.619 
since I talked about hi speaks a little
bit<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.439> high-speed<00:04:43.819> protection<00:04:44.819> so<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.449> this

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
bit of high-speed protection so in this

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.570 
bit of high-speed protection so in this
case<00:04:45.930> here<00:04:46.289> I<00:04:46.560> pitched<00:04:47.129> my<00:04:47.340> pitch<00:04:47.759> dome<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
case here I pitched my pitch dome and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.920 
case here I pitched my pitch dome and
let<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.729> go<00:04:50.879> down<00:04:51.090> let's<00:04:51.569> see<00:04:51.750> what<00:04:51.930> happens

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
let it go down let's see what happens

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.350 
let it go down let's see what happens
once<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.080> goes<00:04:55.259> over<00:04:55.669> VMO<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:56.849> can<00:04:56.969> see<00:04:57.180> that

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
once it goes over VMO you can see that

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.459 
once it goes over VMO you can see that
my<00:04:57.659> hands<00:04:58.020> off<00:04:58.319> and<00:04:59.449> this<00:05:00.449> is<00:05:00.659> no<00:05:00.870> longer<00:05:01.110> mine

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
my hands off and this is no longer mine

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.709 
my hands off and this is no longer mine
there's<00:05:01.979> no<00:05:02.129> autopilot<00:05:02.430> here<00:05:02.940> this<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.270> the

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
there's no autopilot here this is the

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.749 
there's no autopilot here this is the
fly-by-wire<00:05:04.349> system<00:05:05.039> connecting<00:05:05.610> the

airplane<00:05:06.090> from<00:05:06.349> high<00:05:07.349> speeds<00:05:07.770> if<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.759> if<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.300> want

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
airplane from high speeds if I if I want

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.369 
airplane from high speeds if I if I want
to<00:05:09.659> repeat<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.039> it<00:05:11.370> will<00:05:11.520> slowly<00:05:12.379> I'm

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
to repeat that and it will slowly I'm

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.520 
to repeat that and it will slowly I'm
just<00:05:14.539> trying<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.569> gain<00:05:15.780> some<00:05:15.810> time<00:05:16.229> but<00:05:16.379> it

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
just trying to gain some time but it

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.649 
just trying to gain some time but it
would<00:05:16.650> slowly<00:05:16.949> bring<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.430> speed<00:05:17.699> back<00:05:17.969> to<00:05:18.509> me

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
would slowly bring the speed back to me

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.399 
would slowly bring the speed back to me
low<00:05:18.949> 329<00:05:20.180> if<00:05:21.180> we<00:05:21.330> do<00:05:21.509> the<00:05:21.690> same<00:05:21.930> thing<00:05:22.199> again

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
low 329 if we do the same thing again

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.939 
low 329 if we do the same thing again
and<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.419> case<00:05:24.750> I'm<00:05:25.379> going<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:25.710> leave<00:05:25.889> some

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
and in this case I'm going to leave some

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:33.980 
and in this case I'm going to leave some
Bank<00:05:26.550> angle

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.850 

we're<00:05:34.990> thinking<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.710> pegs<00:05:35.949> hands<00:05:36.520> off<00:05:36.699> again

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.730 

Oh

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.850 

if<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:50.949> do<00:05:51.129> that<00:05:51.340> once<00:05:51.909> again<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.689> I'll<00:05:53.680> be

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
if we do that once again and I'll be

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.270 
if we do that once again and I'll be
trying<00:05:54.189> to<00:05:54.370> hold<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:54.970> bank<00:05:55.210> angle<00:05:55.509> and<00:05:56.349> around

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
trying to hold the bank angle and around

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:16.540 
trying to hold the bank angle and around
90<00:05:57.729> degrees<00:05:57.759> banking

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.130 

okay<00:06:17.550> 3:20<00:06:18.180> have<00:06:18.360> you've<00:06:18.480> been<00:06:18.630> pulling<00:06:19.050> the

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
okay 3:20 have you've been pulling the

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.200 
okay 3:20 have you've been pulling the
side<00:06:19.350> stick<00:06:19.620> all<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.950> way<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.400> right<00:06:20.580> that

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
side stick all the way to the right that

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.260 
side stick all the way to the right that
only<00:06:21.270> gives<00:06:21.720> me<00:06:21.810> 33<00:06:22.560> degrees<00:06:23.010> of<00:06:23.190> bay<00:06:23.370> so

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
only gives me 33 degrees of bay so

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.570 
only gives me 33 degrees of bay so
whenever<00:06:24.540> I<00:06:24.750> both<00:06:24.990> maximum<00:06:25.680> side<00:06:25.980> stick

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
whenever I both maximum side stick

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.720 
whenever I both maximum side stick
it'll<00:06:27.200> in<00:06:28.200> high-speed<00:06:28.500> situation<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.580> only

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
it'll in high-speed situation it only

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.460 
it'll in high-speed situation it only
lets<00:06:30.000> me<00:06:30.180> go<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.540> 33<00:06:30.900> degrees<00:06:32.150> so<00:06:33.150> this<00:06:34.080> is<00:06:34.260> also

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
lets me go to 33 degrees so this is also

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.960 
lets me go to 33 degrees so this is also
something<00:06:34.650> that<00:06:35.040> would<00:06:35.340> be<00:06:35.430> consider<00:06:35.820> is

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
something that would be consider is

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.920 
something that would be consider is
really<00:06:36.270> nice<00:06:36.680> related<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.450> no<00:06:39.450> part

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
really nice related to the no part

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.830 
really nice related to the no part
limits<00:06:40.380> for<00:06:40.680> pitch<00:06:40.950> and<00:06:41.250> roll<00:06:41.430> we<00:06:42.270> also<00:06:42.390> like

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
limits for pitch and roll we also like

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.290 
limits for pitch and roll we also like
that<00:06:43.110> due<00:06:43.920> to<00:06:44.990> abnormal<00:06:45.990> attitude<00:06:46.530> recovery

in<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:06.030> Cessna<00:07:06.750> 172<00:07:07.530> so<00:07:07.890> you<00:07:08.370> know<00:07:08.490> if<00:07:08.700> your

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
in the Cessna 172 so you know if your

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.840 
in the Cessna 172 so you know if your
nose<00:07:09.720> eye<00:07:10.020> and<00:07:10.440> nose<00:07:10.920> really<00:07:11.280> high<00:07:11.610> you're

going to put 90 degrees Bank and keep it

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.160 
going to put 90 degrees Bank and keep it
down<00:07:14.040> to<00:07:14.280> the<00:07:14.400> horizon<00:07:14.550> if<00:07:15.480> you're<00:07:15.750> in<00:07:15.900> and

down to the horizon if you're in and

down to the horizon if you're in and
those<00:07:16.890> down<00:07:17.220> you're<00:07:17.550> gonna<00:07:17.670> hog<00:07:17.910> obviously

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
those down you're gonna hog obviously

back the procedure is always the same

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.630 
back the procedure is always the same
nice<00:07:24.690> nice<00:07:25.530> thing<00:07:25.800> I<00:07:25.980> don't<00:07:26.040> know<00:07:26.220> if<00:07:26.340> people

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
nice nice thing I don't know if people

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.250 
nice nice thing I don't know if people
have<00:07:26.670> talked<00:07:27.060> about<00:07:27.210> here<00:07:27.600> in<00:07:27.690> this<00:07:27.870> airplane

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
have talked about here in this airplane

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.030 
have talked about here in this airplane
since<00:07:29.120> of<00:07:30.120> course<00:07:30.450> of<00:07:30.960> design<00:07:31.350> that<00:07:31.650> is

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
since of course of design that is

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.020 
since of course of design that is
up<00:07:33.820> today<00:07:34.680> we<00:07:35.680> can<00:07:35.860> take<00:07:36.010> credit<00:07:36.400> for

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
up today we can take credit for

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.020 
up today we can take credit for
technology<00:07:37.840> it<00:07:38.350> has<00:07:38.530> more<00:07:38.860> redundancy<00:07:39.430> also

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
technology it has more redundancy also

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.860 
technology it has more redundancy also
as<00:07:40.450> an<00:07:40.750> Airbus<00:07:41.170> or<00:07:41.470> even<00:07:41.770> as<00:07:41.920> a<00:07:41.950> welcome<00:07:42.880> 7x<00:07:43.420> and

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
as an Airbus or even as a welcome 7x and

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.230 
as an Airbus or even as a welcome 7x and
then<00:07:44.020> means<00:07:44.260> that<00:07:44.470> either<00:07:45.190> you're<00:07:45.700> in<00:07:45.730> normal

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
then means that either you're in normal

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.350 
then means that either you're in normal
mode<00:07:46.360> and<00:07:46.660> you<00:07:46.960> have<00:07:47.140> everything<00:07:47.820> or<00:07:48.820> you're
