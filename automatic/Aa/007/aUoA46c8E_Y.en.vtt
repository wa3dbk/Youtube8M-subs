00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.580 

question<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.370> timing<00:02:38.090> between<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
question for you so timing between the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.770 
question for you so timing between the
quarterback<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.940> running<00:02:41.270> back<00:02:41.450> is

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
quarterback and the running back is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.580 
quarterback and the running back is
critical<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:44.060> jet<00:02:44.360> yep<00:02:44.780> how<00:02:45.110> do<00:02:45.440> you

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
critical with the jet yep how do you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.160 
critical with the jet yep how do you
train<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> it's<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.110> you

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
train them to it's just you just you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.710 
train them to it's just you just you
gotta<00:02:48.530> wrap<00:02:48.830> them<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.250> every<00:02:49.820> slot<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.480> going

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
gotta wrap them and every slot is going

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.440 
gotta wrap them and every slot is going
to<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.900> different<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:52.490> know<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:52.820> Jake<00:02:53.270> might

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
to be different you know like Jake might

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.150 
to be different you know like Jake might
be<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:53.720> faster<00:02:54.200> than<00:02:54.350> somebody<00:02:54.650> else<00:02:54.740> or

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
be a little faster than somebody else or

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.790 
be a little faster than somebody else or
there<00:02:56.090> might<00:02:56.270> be<00:02:56.330> we<00:02:57.080> may<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> slot<00:02:57.590> that's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
there might be we may have a slot that's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.030 
there might be we may have a slot that's
faster<00:02:58.250> than<00:02:58.280> jake<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.300> timing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
faster than jake so it's it's timing

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.710 
faster than jake so it's it's timing
it's<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:01.220> repetition<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:02.060> will<00:03:02.300> do<00:03:02.510> this

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
it's just repetition it will do this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.910 
it's just repetition it will do this
will<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.230> mesh<00:03:03.440> drill<00:03:03.740> with<00:03:03.830> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
will do that mesh drill with the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.950 
will do that mesh drill with the
handoffs<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:04.730> done<00:03:05.000> every<00:03:05.600> day<00:03:05.780> in

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
handoffs that's done every day in
