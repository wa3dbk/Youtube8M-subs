what<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.789> oddball<00:01:03.300> there's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
what you know is oddball there's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
what you know is oddball there's
essentially<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.769> flag<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.220> grab<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> flag

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
essentially one flag you grab the flag

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
essentially one flag you grab the flag
and<00:01:06.180> instead<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> returning<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and instead of returning it to the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
and instead of returning it to the
enemy's<00:01:08.010> base<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.520> gotta<00:01:08.670> run<00:01:08.880> around

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
enemy's base you just gotta run around

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.399 
enemy's base you just gotta run around
with<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> longer<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> hold<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
with it and the longer you hold it the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100 
with it and the longer you hold it the
more<00:01:10.619> points<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.180> accumulate<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.510> your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
more points you accumulate and your

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.600 
more points you accumulate and your
team's<00:01:13.350> jobs<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> protect<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> other

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
team's jobs to protect you and the other

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
team's jobs to protect you and the other
team's<00:01:14.850> job<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.240> kill<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.750> take

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
team's job is to kill you and then take

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.450 
team's job is to kill you and then take
that<00:01:16.140> flag<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> hold<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.100> long<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.340> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that flag and hold it as long as they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
that flag and hold it as long as they
can<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.290> that's<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> idea<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> game<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
can so that's the idea of the game it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
can so that's the idea of the game it
looks<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.159> fun<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.960> yeah<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> guess

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
looks really fun you know yeah I guess

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
looks really fun you know yeah I guess
the<00:01:22.500> idea<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> run<00:01:23.159> away<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the idea would be to run away so that it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520 
the idea would be to run away so that it
could<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> could<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
could you know I could see in a little

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.580 
could you know I could see in a little
bit<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.820> hide<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.380> if

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
bit of a get it and hide I'm not sure if

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.539 
bit of a get it and hide I'm not sure if
there's<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> marker<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> map

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
there's going to be a marker on the map

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
there's going to be a marker on the map
telling<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> where<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> person<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.500> would

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
telling you where the person is I would

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.980 
telling you where the person is I would
imagine<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.579> else<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.850> be

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
imagine there would be or else would be

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
imagine there would be or else would be
very<00:01:33.990> easy<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> hide<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.890> hopefully<00:01:35.280> they

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
very easy to hide so hopefully they

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.060 
very easy to hide so hopefully they
implement<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.500> not<00:01:37.500> too<00:01:37.710> many<00:01:37.860> details

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
implement that and not too many details

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
implement that and not too many details
on<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.790> couple<00:01:39.720> other<00:01:39.900> game<00:01:40.079> types<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
on that a couple other game types of one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.749 
on that a couple other game types of one
that<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.740> released<00:01:40.979> awhile<00:01:41.189> ago<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> called

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that was released awhile ago is called

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
that was released awhile ago is called
Kill<00:01:42.060> Confirmed<00:01:42.320> now<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Kill Confirmed now what this is is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
Kill Confirmed now what this is is
essentially<00:01:44.729> team<00:01:44.970> deathmatch<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
essentially team deathmatch but when you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.179 
essentially team deathmatch but when you
kill<00:01:46.200> someone<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> point

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
kill someone you don't get the point

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
kill someone you don't get the point
until<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> run<00:01:47.850> over<00:01:47.909> their<00:01:48.270> dead<00:01:48.299> body<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
until you run over their dead body and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.770 
until you run over their dead body and
pick<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.140> their<00:01:49.259> dog<00:01:49.409> tag<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.970> am<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pick up their dog tag I am this is the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
pick up their dog tag I am this is the
game<00:01:51.930> type<00:01:52.110> i'm<00:01:52.259> probably<00:01:52.530> looking<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> most

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
game type i'm probably looking the most

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
game type i'm probably looking the most
forward<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> prevent

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
forward to because it's going to prevent

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.389 
forward to because it's going to prevent
camp<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.500> can't<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.890> sit<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> back

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
camp and you can't just sit in the back

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.420 
camp and you can't just sit in the back
and<00:01:56.579> pick<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.210> people<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.439> you're<00:01:59.310> not

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and pick off people because you're not

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
and pick off people because you're not
going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.670> any<00:01:59.850> points<00:02:00.439> because<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
going to get any points because if the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
going to get any points because if the
enemy<00:02:01.920> runs<00:02:02.130> over<00:02:02.310> their<00:02:02.430> dead<00:02:02.460> body<00:02:02.790> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
enemy runs over their dead body then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.539 
enemy runs over their dead body then
they<00:02:03.420> counteract<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.469> kale<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.340> can't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
they counteract the kale and you can't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
they counteract the kale and you can't
claim<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> point<00:02:06.210> anymore<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> run

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
claim that point anymore you have to run

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.359 
claim that point anymore you have to run
over<00:02:07.110> their<00:02:07.290> body<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.860> after<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.099> kill<00:02:08.250> them

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
over their body so after you kill them

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.969 
over their body so after you kill them
gotta<00:02:08.580> run<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> them<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.470> yeah<00:02:10.470> it's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
gotta run up to them and yeah it's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.150 
gotta run up to them and yeah it's
looking<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.280> good<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.390> there's<00:02:12.599> one<00:02:12.780> more

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
looking really good and there's one more

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.400 
looking really good and there's one more
game<00:02:14.150> type<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.540> about<00:02:14.810> that's<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.290> sure

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
game type I know about that's for sure

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
game type I know about that's for sure
in<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> game<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.130> infection<00:02:16.990> now<00:02:17.990> if

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
in the game and that is infection now if

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.470 
in the game and that is infection now if
you've<00:02:18.980> ever<00:02:19.100> played<00:02:19.250> Mike<00:02:19.490> Myers<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.030> you

know private game matches and call of
duty<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.660> very<00:02:23.780> similar<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
duty this is very similar to that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.350 
duty this is very similar to that
disinfection<00:02:24.890> as<00:02:25.160> far<00:02:25.670> as<00:02:25.760> i<00:02:25.820> know<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.150> only

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
disinfection as far as i know is only

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.790 
disinfection as far as i know is only
for<00:02:26.600> private<00:02:26.990> game<00:02:27.140> modes<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.590> going<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
for private game modes it's not going to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200 
for private game modes it's not going to
be<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> game<00:02:28.100> mode<00:02:28.280> online<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.880> can<00:02:28.970> play

be a game mode online that you can play

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.180 
be a game mode online that you can play
but<00:02:29.840> there's<00:02:30.590> not<00:02:30.740> too<00:02:30.860> many<00:02:30.950> details

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
but there's not too many details

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.590 
but there's not too many details
essentially<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.240> as<00:02:32.390> one

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
have super speed and health not too sure

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.170 
have super speed and health not too sure
on<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> details<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:43.700> could<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.030> really

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
on the details but could be really

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.340 
on the details but could be really
interesting<00:02:44.270> it's<00:02:44.780> probably<00:02:45.020> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> have

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
interesting it's probably going to have

from<00:03:15.020> his<00:03:15.140> Twitter<00:03:15.380> now<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.400> leaves<00:03:16.550> me<00:03:16.700> to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
from his Twitter now that leaves me to

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.920 
from his Twitter now that leaves me to
leave<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.120> there's<00:03:17.270> not<00:03:17.360> going<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.570> be<00:03:17.630> one

leave that there's not going to be one

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870 
leave that there's not going to be one
and<00:03:18.170> there<00:03:18.500> probably<00:03:18.620> won't<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.610> idea

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and there probably won't be but the idea

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.490 
and there probably won't be but the idea
of<00:03:19.940> having<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.390> one<00:03:20.540> hit<00:03:20.720> kill<00:03:20.780> sniper<00:03:21.140> game

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
type would be kind of cool and but

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.300 
type would be kind of cool and but
unfortunately<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.650> don't<00:03:24.709> think<00:03:24.890> it's<00:03:25.100> coming

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
unfortunately I don't think it's coming

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
similar it's going to come back and it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.890

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
it's going to be pretty similar to how

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.420 
it's going to be pretty similar to how
was<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.000> modern<00:03:32.240> warfare<00:03:32.270> 2<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.530> snipers<00:03:33.980> you

that's<00:03:58.280> one<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.610> things<00:03:58.670> i<00:03:58.940> was<00:03:59.060> really

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150

infinity<00:04:50.509> ward<00:04:50.660> Infinity<00:04:51.440> Ward<00:04:51.650> didn't

either<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.930> cult<00:04:57.199> Duty<00:04:57.380> games<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.680> have

either of the cult Duty games that have

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.010 
either of the cult Duty games that have
zombies<00:04:58.160> so<00:04:58.669> it's<00:04:59.240> not<00:04:59.389> going<00:04:59.509> to<00:04:59.599> have<00:04:59.690> amies

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
zombies so it's not going to have amies

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.839 
zombies so it's not going to have amies
maybe<00:05:00.320> it'll<00:05:00.860> be<00:05:00.979> something<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.430> implement

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
maybe it'll be something to implement

later<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.180> III<00:05:03.169> think<00:05:03.680> it's<00:05:03.800> like<00:05:03.949> about<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.160> a

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
later on III think it's like about it a

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.950 
later on III think it's like about it a
ten<00:05:04.970> percent<00:05:05.120> chance<00:05:05.479> there's<00:05:05.720> gonna<00:05:05.840> be

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
ten percent chance there's gonna be

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.050 
ten percent chance there's gonna be
zombies<00:05:06.289> I<00:05:06.380> don't<00:05:06.560> think<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.039> that<00:05:07.099> it's

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
zombies I don't think it's that it's

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.779 
zombies I don't think it's that it's
gonna<00:05:08.270> they're<00:05:08.509> gonna<00:05:08.599> be<00:05:08.810> any<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.789> it's

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
gonna they're gonna be any and it's

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.520 
gonna they're gonna be any and it's
quite<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.210> bummer<00:05:11.479> but<00:05:11.720> hopefully<00:05:12.110> hopefully

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
quite a bummer but hopefully hopefully

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.930 
quite a bummer but hopefully hopefully
the<00:05:12.770> survival<00:05:13.190> mode<00:05:13.310> will<00:05:13.460> be<00:05:13.550> really<00:05:13.789> fun

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.969 
the survival mode will be really fun
it's<00:05:14.120> going<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.300> be<00:05:14.360> similar<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.830> what<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:15.949> see

in Halo I think they pulled a lot of

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.060 
in Halo I think they pulled a lot of
things<00:05:17.870> from<00:05:17.930> Halo<00:05:18.289> but<00:05:18.680> it's<00:05:18.830> going<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.009> be

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
things from Halo but it's going to be

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.620 
things from Halo but it's going to be
similar<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.400> what<00:05:19.669> firefighters<00:05:19.970> in<00:05:20.389> halo

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
similar to what firefighters in halo
