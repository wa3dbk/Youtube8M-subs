 Yes, even I was good friends 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.659
 I 'm sure I threw it up and it was general but when it was a little sweet 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.680
 If it runs out, it is a feature service nation 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.210
 It was straight 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 It is interesting this is good 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.560

 Those that wait for the place you want to go 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.159
 Ando looked a little above 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.159
 There was an animation 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.670
 N This Malo Tteru 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.450
 Good Na yes 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.440
 Because the mind of you 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 Is n't it? 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.270
 After all it is until it is always in this care when it is colored and I think that it is this 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 Please have spilled you to involuntarily 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.090

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.090
 Also two Pike 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.570
 It is not applied in conjunction with the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.570
 This is no more than one 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.960
 Kanto issue 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.120
 About 10 years 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.250
 Yes 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 That means it was the old frame spare when it was seen as Ando pro. 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.340
 And a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.780
 I hear it is losing 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.580
 It will strike and the boa count will strike even at 44 e 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.560

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.210

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.880
 Hmm 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.990
 You will lose Kiyo 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.820

 The eco- friendly and disaster- prone disaster will make us a good start 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:19.629
 I think that it would be better if I do so I will do my best again 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.629

 No step ladder really that should not to be well in'll difficult that this game is 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:45.249
 I really think every year It seems that if you come to the middle of the career of Ando and various things 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:49.089
 If you think about it, I will already 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:55.359
 q I thought there was a place like &amp; 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:56.079
 It's a tough place Ando pro is also good, but the people of Taiwan are regrettable and passive 

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:59.020
 But I would not 

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:02.030
 Change the tourist pipe 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.240
 That 's right, after all that Matsumoto's sister 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.190
 I guess it is innocent unselfish 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.270
 I said it still now g 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.000
 After all Kedomo was saying Tatte throwing it Tteyuu are thinking only of the line 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.130
 That's right 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.130
