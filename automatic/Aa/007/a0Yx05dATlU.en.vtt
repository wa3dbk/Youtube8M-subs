00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey folks this is another in a series of

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey folks this is another in a series of
my<00:00:02.370> recently<00:00:02.879> found<00:00:03.210> knives<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.899> had<00:00:04.020> was

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
my recently found knives that I had was

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.630 
my recently found knives that I had was
not<00:00:04.350> know<00:00:04.470> when<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.620> was<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.770> kid<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.069> each<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
not know when I was a kid so each of

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.460 
not know when I was a kid so each of
these<00:00:05.700> knives<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.330> at<00:00:06.480> least<00:00:06.660> 30<00:00:06.899> years<00:00:07.080> old

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
these knives is at least 30 years old

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.040 
these knives is at least 30 years old
and<00:00:08.099> more<00:00:08.700> than<00:00:08.849> likely<00:00:09.090> much<00:00:09.630> older<00:00:09.960> than

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and more than likely much older than

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.690 
and more than likely much older than
that<00:00:10.260> because<00:00:10.500> they<00:00:10.740> were<00:00:10.800> used<00:00:11.219> when<00:00:11.550> I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
that because they were used when I

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.430 
that because they were used when I
received<00:00:12.059> them<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:14.299> oldest<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.480> probably<00:00:15.809> 40s

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
received them so oldest is probably 40s

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.670 
received them so oldest is probably 40s
or<00:00:16.560> 50s<00:00:16.740> newest<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.730> probably<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.260> early

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
or 50s newest is probably in the early

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.779 
or 50s newest is probably in the early
80s<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:22.289> small<00:00:22.789> pocket

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
80s so this one is a very small pocket

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.189 
80s so this one is a very small pocket

of tapped in 33 nails on each side okay

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
of tapped in 33 nails on each side okay
still<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.150> condition<00:01:26.900> standard

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
still in pretty good condition standard

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.240 
still in pretty good condition standard
metal<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> slip<00:01:28.920> joint<00:01:29.570> mechanism<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
metal for the slip joint mechanism and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700 
metal for the slip joint mechanism and
let's<00:01:32.549> open<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> again<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.079> look<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
let's open it up again and look at the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.190 
let's open it up again and look at the
blade<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.340> primary<00:01:35.939> blade<00:01:36.270> focus<00:01:37.170> back

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.960 

primary<00:01:43.200> blade<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> unique<00:01:46.159> curved<00:01:47.159> drop

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
primary blade is the unique curved drop

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
primary blade is the unique curved drop
point<00:01:48.270> kinda<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.810> almost<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> very

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
point kinda it's almost like a very

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.469 
point kinda it's almost like a very
small<00:01:50.430> recurve<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.270> been<00:01:51.390> damaged<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:53.479> little

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
small recurve it's been damaged a little

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
small recurve it's been damaged a little
bit<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> damage<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> looks<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
bit of damage there but it looks like in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.450 
bit of damage there but it looks like in
a<00:01:56.070> somewhat<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> recurve<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.040> 2

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a somewhat of a recurve in there so 2

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
a somewhat of a recurve in there so 2
inches<00:01:59.790> of<00:02:00.079> community<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> sorry

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
inches of community that can you sorry

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.859 
inches of community that can you sorry
about<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> two<00:02:02.820> inches<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.710> cutting<00:02:04.710> surface

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
about that two inches of cutting surface

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.700 
about that two inches of cutting surface
you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.469> bit<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
you can see there's a little bit of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.960 
you can see there's a little bit of
curve<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.069> also<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.489> bit<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> damage

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
curve but also a little bit of damage

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.260 
curve but also a little bit of damage
right<00:02:09.479> then

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
right then

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.420 
right then
and<00:02:10.360> then<00:02:10.570> then<00:02:10.780> then<00:02:10.810> blade<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:13.410> markings

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and then then then blade and markings

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.040 
and then then then blade and markings
let<00:02:15.430> me<00:02:15.520> show<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.120> other<00:02:16.180> blade<00:02:16.600> before<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
let me show you the other blade before I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.210 
let me show you the other blade before I
go<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> markings<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.920> an

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
inch yeah inch and a half inch and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.620 
inch yeah inch and a half inch and
one-fourth<00:02:25.890> cutting<00:02:26.890> surface<00:02:30.420> standard<00:02:31.420> drop

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
one-fourth cutting surface standard drop

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.390 
one-fourth cutting surface standard drop
point<00:02:31.870> shape<00:02:32.440> there<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:32.950> let's<00:02:33.100> go<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
point shape there so let's go to the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
point shape there so let's go to the
markings<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> blade<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.550> is

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
markings on the blade this one is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.190 
markings on the blade this one is
Imperial<00:02:38.470> stainless<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.270> brands<00:02:43.930> or

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
