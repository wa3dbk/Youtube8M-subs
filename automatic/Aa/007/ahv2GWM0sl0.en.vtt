it's<00:03:53.890> kind<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.160> pointless<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:55.060> yeah<00:03:55.450> these

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
it's kind of pointless but yeah these

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.789 
it's kind of pointless but yeah these
were<00:03:55.840> from<00:03:55.989> Russell<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.350> Romney<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> think

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799

about<00:03:57.340> three<00:03:57.670> years<00:03:57.850> ago<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.739> might<00:04:00.190> be

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
about three years ago so I might be

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.039 
about three years ago so I might be
getting<00:04:00.400> some<00:04:00.670> new<00:04:00.700> ones<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.060> those<00:04:01.239> soon<00:04:01.600> as

be really hard to do this on camera I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
be really hard to do this on camera I

know you just put the little silver

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.120 
know you just put the little silver
button<00:04:35.340> through<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.880> toggle<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:37.130> then

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
button through the toggle and then

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.529 
button through the toggle and then
you're<00:04:38.699> done<00:04:38.880> these<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.389> come<00:04:39.479> with

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
you're done these actually come with

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.450 
you're done these actually come with
three<00:04:39.930> different<00:04:40.620> sections<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.310> can

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
three different sections that you can

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.559 
three different sections that you can
put<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.639> button<00:04:41.880> through<00:04:42.030> as<00:04:42.090> well<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.479> you

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
put the button through as well so you

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.270 
put the button through as well so you
can<00:04:42.690> have<00:04:42.810> different<00:04:42.960> sizes<00:04:43.319> but<00:04:43.919> I'd<00:04:44.069> say

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
can have different sizes but I'd say

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.240 
can have different sizes but I'd say
most<00:04:44.669> wrists<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:46.319> the<00:04:46.440> average<00:04:46.800> risk<00:04:47.039> would

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
most wrists like the average risk would

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.800 
most wrists like the average risk would
be<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.580> smaller<00:04:47.819> setting<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.389> they<00:04:48.509> do<00:04:48.569> go

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
be the smaller setting so they do go

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.110 
be the smaller setting so they do go
quite<00:04:49.050> big<00:04:49.259> and<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:50.669> trim<00:04:50.820> off<00:04:50.880> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
quite big and then you just trim off the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.730 
quite big and then you just trim off the
leather<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.570> that's<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> wrap<00:04:52.169> bracelet<00:04:52.560> a

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
leather so that's the wrap bracelet a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.260 
leather so that's the wrap bracelet a
little<00:04:53.070> bit<00:04:53.160> more<00:04:53.340> explanation<00:04:53.610> for<00:04:53.940> anyone
