00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:30.210 

now<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.240> go<00:02:16.510> back<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.230> neck

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:40.059 

now<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.280> go<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.760> back<00:02:31.970> way

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.500 

once<00:02:45.800> we<00:02:46.010> reach<00:02:46.220> lower<00:02:46.520> down<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.030> legs<00:02:47.270> to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
once we reach lower down the legs to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.480 
once we reach lower down the legs to
stop<00:02:47.810> collecting<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.530> fiber<00:02:48.770> because<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
stop collecting the fiber because it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.640 
stop collecting the fiber because it
becomes<00:02:49.730> too<00:02:49.880> cold

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.220 

now<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:54.710> flip<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.340> animal<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.060> this

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.800

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
now we can take the rest of their fiber

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.720 
now we can take the rest of their fiber
now<00:03:03.810> he's<00:03:04.050> here<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.800> opposite<00:03:05.370> direction

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
now he's here in the opposite direction

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:27.660 
now he's here in the opposite direction
this<00:03:06.090> side

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
you have to be very careful while

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
you have to be very careful while
harvesting<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> fiber<00:03:30.640> not<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.209> break<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660

crimp

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:46.550

one of the most important jobs is

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.360 
one of the most important jobs is
holding<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> animal<00:03:50.230> head<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.800> she<00:03:50.860> doesn't

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
holding the animal head so she doesn't

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.050 
holding the animal head so she doesn't
get<00:03:51.510> another<00:03:52.510> job<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.200> shearing<00:03:53.739> which<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.910> the

get another job of shearing which is the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.690 
get another job of shearing which is the
person<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.720> Clippers<00:03:56.370> obviously<00:03:57.370> this

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
person with the Clippers obviously this

cutting<00:06:13.280> up<00:06:13.490> serum<00:06:13.850> is<00:06:13.970> short<00:06:14.450> this<00:06:15.290> is<00:06:15.350> also

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
cutting up serum is short this is also

done with scissors and once again the

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:25.270 
done with scissors and once again the
fiber<00:06:18.410> is<00:06:18.650> used<00:06:18.680> for<00:06:19.100> nesting<00:06:23.650> that<00:06:24.650> way<00:06:24.860> I

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
fiber is used for nesting that way I

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760
