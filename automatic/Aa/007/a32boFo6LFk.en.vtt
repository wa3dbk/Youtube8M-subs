00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello very good now let's teach 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.520
 how the sound of any 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.219
 Re facto vehicle we want 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.539
 play in this case what we have to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 have mainly is the mode of each 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:21.540
 of each game of what we are going to get the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.870
 sound is worth in this case here you can see 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.080
 I have several erre facto worth 1 I have it 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.080
 here 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.320
 the acts 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.600
 with is made up of dmg types web world 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 karting 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.780
 Well, these are the possibilities 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.460
 that I have within this mode of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.379
 use any of the sounds in 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.740
 any of the cars of the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.780
 modalities that exist here 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.870
 In fact what I have done is to take this 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.590
 rm folder that brings several vehicles 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.830
 and jewelry 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.900
 so it is worth choosing those who sincerely 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.420
 we are going to use in this case then 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.370
 you can use the ones you want to create 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.410
 a folder you sound distribution 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.960
 I'll leave a link where you can download 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.670
 this folder and good already left then 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 good has left the turbo to bring 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.890
 there are several vouchers we leave this because 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.060
 we thought about the file and I like well 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.490
 I will do so to him up two 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.650
 parts and how he does not leave me 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.090
 decided to draw some in this case 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.270
 let's imagine that we are going to use the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.670
 sound of the ford capri is worth but 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 We are using the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 the monk b2 for 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.940
 or almost 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.830
 overtake vehicles people around here these 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.810
 are our vehicles and this is the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.909
 folder that we download 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.149
 I repeat again if you have another 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.110
 mode you can pick up the sound folder 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.020
 in this case we do not have the mod 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.810
 the boat this is worth now because I 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.460
 I got it but let's say it does not exist 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.140
 this folder then what I have done is 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.230
 I open here I go to the ships that is the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.650
 modality and the car that I'm going to catch and 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.750
 I take this file from here, and this is 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.850
 the price of cake all babies 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.569
 they have this file and they are all the same 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.819
 through this that is fx 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.219
 if the teams come compadre of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.109
 matches like those of apm each 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:24.310
 car has a different sound and 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:29.769
 we will have to choose we will have the file 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.540
 that fx is good we'll leave it as 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.689
 we have it and this is the sound that I have 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.219
 but well now I want to get the one from 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.980
 any other vehicle in this case 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:42.159
 let's choose the one in the folder that does not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.099
 we have gone down then we would go here 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.650
 remember as if it did not exist we take 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.239
 this folder and we had it here is worth 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 this case once we have this 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.989
 folder let's go to who is not going to pass 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.910
 because this one has less cars I'm going to 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.810
 leave it 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.180
 and check that they are within the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.290
 vehicles then we do the following 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:10.030
 crm that vehicle that I like which 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.040
 which is a way to come by cable 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.870
 you have seen that they are 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 all the same and only have one file 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.720
 fx and then this active 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.640
 let's do the following we 're going to 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.180
 copy here for now 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.810
 age 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.510
 here for the moment I leave it here it's worth it 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.340
 this is the one that I'm going to use then 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.040
 I do the following 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.170
 I'm going 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.050
 to my vehicle 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:45.660
 I take the bmw mode and here where we see 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.840
 the s fx m.sc x we are going to give 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.620
 the name to this file from there in this 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 case we do like this 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.200
 properties 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.550
 hit land here we go here 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:05.000
 Rename 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.250
 we erase all the indifferent and 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.630
 it is already called the vehicle file of the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.490
 trm is already called mx3 point is equal fx 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.810
 that the one we are using up to 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.579
 moment and we have changes good as 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.220
 let's do the following I'm going to catch 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.530
 this file I'm going to pass here and I'm going 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.450
 to say yes I want to overwrite what they weigh 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.250
 same because it's exactly right now 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.680
 the file that I am using I am 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.260
 using the sound of two ford capri in the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.210
 mode of the m3 then move and 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.030
 replace because I will be then 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.630
 is already the next thing would be to open our 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.900
 benefactor catch our vehicle 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.810
 our bmw and go out to the views and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.580
 check that indeed it has been 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.690
 changed sounds good I hope not 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.700
 has been helpful 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.100
 soon we will be creating more 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.100
 tutorials here in champions vitro word
