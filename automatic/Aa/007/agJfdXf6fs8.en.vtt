00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.869 

so<00:00:12.379> here<00:00:12.530> you<00:00:12.589> can<00:00:12.650> see<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:12.920> raspberry<00:00:13.820> pi

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
so here you can see the raspberry pi

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.189 
so here you can see the raspberry pi
underneath<00:00:14.629> with<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:15.440> brick<00:00:15.650> pie<00:00:15.860> on<00:00:16.070> top<00:00:16.369> um

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
underneath with the brick pie on top um

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.710 
underneath with the brick pie on top um
you've<00:00:18.199> got<00:00:18.349> it<00:00:18.470> attached<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.759> Lego

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
you've got it attached to the Lego

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.839 
you've got it attached to the Lego
housing<00:00:21.650> with<00:00:21.970> some<00:00:22.970> simple<00:00:23.239> black<00:00:23.599> pins

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
housing with some simple black pins

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.269 
housing with some simple black pins
we've<00:00:25.849> also<00:00:26.000> got<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.360> hdmi<00:00:26.929> monitor<00:00:27.289> up<00:00:28.009> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
we've also got the hdmi monitor up and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.249 
we've also got the hdmi monitor up and
running<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:28.759> it's<00:00:29.060> running<00:00:29.599> as<00:00:29.689> a<00:00:29.720> computer

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
running so it's running as a computer

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.549 
running so it's running as a computer
we've<00:00:31.160> got<00:00:31.339> the<00:00:31.609> three<00:00:32.059> motors<00:00:32.509> for<00:00:33.019> our<00:00:33.199> Lego

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
we've got the three motors for our Lego

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.250 
we've got the three motors for our Lego
claw<00:00:34.839> are<00:00:35.839> attached<00:00:36.199> in<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.920> Lego<00:00:38.019> ports<00:00:39.019> on

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
claw are attached in the Lego ports on

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:49.000 
claw are attached in the Lego ports on
top<00:00:39.769> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.600> brick<00:00:41.600> pie

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.920 

so<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.130> brick<00:00:50.310> pie<00:00:50.490> is<00:00:50.700> powered<00:00:51.150> by<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.360> 9-volt

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so the brick pie is powered by a 9-volt

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.780 
so the brick pie is powered by a 9-volt
battery

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.860 

so<00:00:56.790> I'll<00:00:56.850> show<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.240> this<00:00:57.390> runs<00:00:57.660> really

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so I'll show you how this runs really

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
so I'll show you how this runs really
quick<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.350> wrote<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.560> quick<00:00:58.770> Python<00:00:59.250> script

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
quick we wrote a quick Python script

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
quick we wrote a quick Python script
that<00:01:00.300> opens<00:01:00.720> and<00:01:00.900> closes<00:01:01.170> some<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> motors

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that opens and closes some of the motors

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.680 
that opens and closes some of the motors
we've<00:01:02.520> got<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.080> claw<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:05.520> front<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> end

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
we've got a claw on the front at the end

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.600 
we've got a claw on the front at the end
of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> arm<00:01:07.050> got<00:01:07.770> something<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.190> raise<00:01:08.370> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of the arm got something to raise the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
of the arm got something to raise the
arm<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> rotate<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> arm<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> brick<00:01:13.890> pie

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
arm and rotate the arm so the brick pie

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
arm and rotate the arm so the brick pie
is<00:01:14.100> powered<00:01:14.610> by<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> 9-volt<00:01:15.300> battery<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is powered by a 9-volt battery well the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
is powered by a 9-volt battery well the
Raspberry<00:01:16.530> Pi<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> attached<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.580> powered<00:01:18.060> by

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Raspberry Pi is attached and powered by

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
Raspberry Pi is attached and powered by
the<00:01:18.420> wall<00:01:18.690> right<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.880> we've<00:01:20.880> got<00:01:20.910> some<00:01:21.300> quick

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the wall right now we've got some quick

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
the wall right now we've got some quick
code<00:01:22.020> written<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> Python<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.010> see<00:01:23.310> it's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
code written in Python you can see it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.790 
code written in Python you can see it's
just<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.850> few<00:01:24.060> lines<00:01:24.300> were<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:25.410> setting<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
just a few lines were more setting the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.410 
just a few lines were more setting the
motor<00:01:25.979> powers<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> waiting<00:01:26.910> for<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> couple<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
motor powers and waiting for a couple of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
motor powers and waiting for a couple of
seconds<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> claw<00:01:29.520> run<00:01:30.259> David

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
seconds you can see the claw run David

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.480 
seconds you can see the claw run David
run<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.100> Python<00:01:34.400> we're<00:01:35.400> off<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.550> running

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710 

it's<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:41.729> cool<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's really cool about this is the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
it's really cool about this is the
weekend<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.520> USB<00:01:44.990> Wi-Fi<00:01:45.990> device<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:51.300> can

weekend at a USB Wi-Fi device we can

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.540 
weekend at a USB Wi-Fi device we can
have<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.720> USB<00:01:52.290> Wi-Fi<00:01:52.530> device<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.369> easily
