where<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.550> end<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.540> started

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
where I would end up I actually started

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.450 
where I would end up I actually started
the<00:00:34.079> music<00:00:34.290> therapy<00:00:34.739> program<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.340> was

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the music therapy program which was

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.370 
the music therapy program which was
really<00:00:35.670> interesting<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.420> class<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.140> case

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
really interesting in class we do case

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
really interesting in class we do case
studies<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:37.980> would<00:00:38.070> analyze<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.520> patient

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
studies where we would analyze a patient

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.160 
studies where we would analyze a patient
with<00:00:39.180> certain<00:00:39.540> disorders

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
with certain disorders

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
with certain disorders
then<00:00:40.680> we'd<00:00:40.860> figure<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> use<00:00:41.760> music<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
