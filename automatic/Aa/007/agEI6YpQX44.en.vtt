 let's talk 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.640
 we're going to wait 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 because I have minecraft 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 we wait for it to open 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.350
 read 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.350
 a creative way 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 survivor is already his thing nothing else 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.409
 that they have to get the materials 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.409
 what am I going to put here 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.530
 first of all let's occupy 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.500
 this tool down here is that 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.409
 I'm seeing that it's the iron room 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.679
 Water 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.210
 in block of grass and carrot or the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.960
 potato that is the same as it comes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.960
 talking like 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.540
 we are in a box 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.290
 what starting three times three with two 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.290
 of depth 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.300
 let's dig 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 what is 3 x 3 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.200
 Y 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.400
 all in depth is now 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.600
 in the middle center we will put water in a 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.600
 corner and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.929
 in the opposite corner so no 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.519
 will forget that the water 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.519
 we grass 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.480
 grass block on top of grass 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.480
 we have the pastor all around here 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 and that's what I'll break or already 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.740
 I broke this too 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.550
 the problem that we have this tells us if 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.120
 this 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.400
 okay 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 here in the middle we will have another cubit 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.610
 of water 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.780
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.350
 Now and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.540
 on the shore we will say that it is 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.540
 carrot carrot 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.930
 fury 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.150
 carrot 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.690
 the best at the time 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.270
 right here 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.700
 the part is here of the earth you started 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.520
 to put coffee 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.760
 the strongest that is here in the new one is 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.740
 the stronger coffee is less stronger 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.170
 that is here means that it happens 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.630
 land is already well deserved which is going to 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.200
 be that it is the huaca that goes to 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.840
 be that I grow in the carrots and I 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.840
 I already had carrots here 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.310
 let's make a yesterday I had done 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.859
 tells us this plant here is more 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.170
 grown that brings it out that you're here because 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.140
 this was the one that always first and already 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.910
 It started to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.140
 knowing already started to grow and already 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.300
 soon 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.380
 I think it's ready, I'm not sure 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.510
 but I'm not going to do it right now 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.440
 with the potatoes is the same 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.910
 procedure you just have to stop 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.600
 potatoes or potatoes or whatever you want to call 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.080
 hence he has put potatoes and I think 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.689
 that no no no I had not put to treat that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.360
 what happens to me here 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.360
 same a box of 3 x 3 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.090
 of depth 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.219
 I'm going to let the water run because it's 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.699
 the same water only that you have to remove 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.699
 the swell 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.010
 woman art 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.030
 it's three water books 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.020
 to the sides 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.020
 on the other side 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.430
 yes 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.210
 up like the procedure 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.210
 previous 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.000
 here half I do not put it because I know what 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.000
 I'm going to occupy 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.730
 What we see 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.730
 Water 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.030
 we also remove the grass or the green 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.800
 Grass 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.660
 and we see how it starts to get wet here 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.660
 also the potatoes 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.860
 we plant 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.930
 and this is what they want to see a sign that 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.930
 say potatoes 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.470
 but I have them 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.479
 I'm busy a cube of the 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.150
 a stone wall 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.390
 let's see what 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.880
 a sign 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.769
 hunger 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.400
 such 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.520
 we know 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.599
 and silvers here and on this side 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.599
 but that has 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.819
 or days 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.590
 this 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.409
 and they can only customize as they 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.139
 Like you can see here this part of 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:23.469
 here from greece more than the out of these 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.469
 sides 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.360
 well that was all in this video I hope 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.570
 you liked it 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.370

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.790
