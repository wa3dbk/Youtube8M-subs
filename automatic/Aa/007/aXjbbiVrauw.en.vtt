00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:55.320
 Well, as you can see, I have some 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.110
 Californian that in his day when I 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.750
 I made them 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.120
 Well, I also liked a little bit of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.650
 light to the face since good to the base I 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 like darker and better and good 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.190
 they liked freshly hairdressing 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.710
 but of course with the sun the pool 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.230
 the iron all things then the end 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.240
 I notice that but it is more burned and that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.390
 the tone of the table has changed me 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.560
 changed already I have it as more so more 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.270
 orange not 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.880
 so then I'm going to go to the 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.770
 hairdresser to me what matrix in a 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.900
 little bit to see if they can take away that 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.520
 it's orange so to speak and what and what 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.060
 cut my tips a little bit for 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.060
 generate it 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.460
 Well, it's already come from the hair 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.329
 you can not appreciate it very well because 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.670
 I wear wet hair 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.460
 since in summer if I wolf you 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.440
 If I told you, we took it out, you choke 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.360
 then nothing comes good wet hair 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.650
 but I liked it very much he told me that 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.380
 his 65 unmarked and nothing the truth is that 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.940
 there is not much contrast already between the base 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.620
 and the point you see then on a blond more 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:46.410
 natural rose more more beautiful not so not 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 orange butane that is not let as this 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.520
