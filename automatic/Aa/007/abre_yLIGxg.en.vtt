00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this was in the demo stage as well where

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.970 
this was in the demo stage as well where
you<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.359> suck<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.989> enemies<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.500> well<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
then you shoot out the enemies as a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.280 
then you shoot out the enemies as a
projectile<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.650> Pierce's<00:03:05.130> enemies<00:03:05.489> oh<00:03:06.290> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
projectile that Pierce's enemies oh is

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.199 
projectile that Pierce's enemies oh is
that<00:03:07.320> what<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.680> supposed<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.220> mm-hmm<00:03:08.790> as

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209

if you'll remember I sucked ass at stage
yeah<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.459> think<00:03:14.519> our<00:03:14.820> main<00:03:14.970> course<00:03:15.299> should

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
yeah but I think our main course should

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.060 
yeah but I think our main course should
be<00:03:15.630> just<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> destroy<00:03:16.230> all<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> enemies<00:03:16.590> I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
be just to destroy all the enemies I

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
I think fraps was just creating a lot

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.260 
I think fraps was just creating a lot
update<00:04:52.870> another<00:04:53.199> file<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.800> it's<00:04:53.919> just<00:04:54.270> taking

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
a dump on me I guess

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:05.790
