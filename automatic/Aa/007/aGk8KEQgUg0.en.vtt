00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
aside and that verizon red is definitely

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.399 
aside and that verizon red is definitely
everywhere<00:00:52.969> on<00:00:53.179> all<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.569> packaging<00:00:54.019> nowadays

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
jumped into there all right packaging

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.819 
jumped into there all right packaging
aside<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.020> battery<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.530> uh<00:01:25.240> eat<00:01:26.240> team<00:01:26.829> actually

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
aside so battery is uh eat team actually

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.889 
aside so battery is uh eat team actually
have<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.399> front<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.700> me<00:01:28.820> 18<00:01:29.210> 30<00:01:29.479> million

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
have it in front of me 18 30 million

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.090 
have it in front of me 18 30 million
power<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.310> not<00:01:31.430> small<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.180> also<00:01:32.329> not

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
power so it's not small it's also not

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.830 
power so it's not small it's also not
huge

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840

internal<00:01:58.429> memory<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.299> got<00:01:59.420> 20<00:01:59.840> out<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
internal memory so you got 20 out of the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.109 
internal memory so you got 20 out of the
box<00:02:00.320> obviously<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:00.979> could<00:02:01.189> jump<00:02:01.399> up<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.549> 32

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
box obviously this could jump up to 32

will actually have to get a little
adapter<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.730> work<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.300> when<00:02:14.840> will

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
adapter to make that work so when will

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.490 
adapter to make that work so when will
be<00:02:14.989> able<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.230> do

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
be able to do

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.810

that's<00:03:25.489> an<00:03:25.610> MHL<00:03:26.090> port<00:03:26.510> because<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.440> believe

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
that's an MHL port because I believe

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.560 
that's an MHL port because I believe
this<00:03:27.920> does<00:03:28.100> HDMI<00:03:28.730> out<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:28.940> can't<00:03:29.269> believe<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
this does HDMI out I can't believe that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.870 
this does HDMI out I can't believe that
it<00:03:29.660> wouldn't<00:03:29.870> sell<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.500> must<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.709> MHL<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.820> you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
it wouldn't sell that must be MHL so you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.039 
it wouldn't sell that must be MHL so you
can<00:03:32.150> also<00:03:32.540> do<00:03:32.870> HDMI<00:03:33.500> out<00:03:33.650> power<00:03:34.370> lock<00:03:34.610> switch

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.589 
razor although not a whole heck of a lot
thicker<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> light<00:04:23.570> phone<00:04:23.840> thin<00:04:24.289> phone
