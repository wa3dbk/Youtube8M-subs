about which nail polishes work best for

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.140 
about which nail polishes work best for
me<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.480> water<00:00:10.080> marbling<00:00:10.290> as<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.550> know<00:00:11.700> water

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
me for water marbling as you know water

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.860 
me for water marbling as you know water
marbling<00:00:12.750> uses<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> nail<00:00:14.160> polish<00:00:14.870> for

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
marbling uses a lot of nail polish for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.859 
marbling uses a lot of nail polish for
the<00:00:15.990> design<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.789> tend<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.300> go<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the design so I tend to go for the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380 
the design so I tend to go for the
cheaper<00:00:19.410> brands<00:00:19.800> because<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.580> mean<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.270> don't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
cheaper brands because I mean you don't

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it those ones like metallic ones they

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
it those ones like metallic ones they
don't<00:01:15.750> work<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.259> well<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.710> other<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
don't work so well but other than that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020 
don't work so well but other than that
all<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:19.049> matte<00:01:19.290> basic<00:01:19.950> colors<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.970> mean

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
all the the matte basic colors I mean

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
all the the matte basic colors I mean
this<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.600> has<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.380> shimmer<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this one has a little bit of shimmer to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.090 
this one has a little bit of shimmer to
it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.730 
it
but<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.610> still<00:01:23.790> works<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.409> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
but it still works really well so this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
but it still works really well so this
this<00:01:26.159> line<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.700> highly<00:01:27.299> recommended<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> each

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this line is highly recommended and each

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.120 
this line is highly recommended and each
bottle<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.520> under<00:01:30.090> three<00:01:30.329> dollars<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.950> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
bottle is under three dollars so this is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
bottle is under three dollars so this is
a<00:01:32.159> great<00:01:32.549> nail<00:01:33.360> polish<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.470> your

called the sinful colors and for this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
called the sinful colors and for this
line<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.220> varies<00:02:49.730> between<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:51.049> nail

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260

line you really varies between one nail
polish<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.980> another<00:02:52.370> one<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:52.909> sometimes<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
polish and another one and sometimes it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.809 
polish and another one and sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:54.019> work<00:02:54.200> well<00:02:54.709> with<00:02:54.919> other<00:02:55.189> nail

doesn't work well with other nail
polishes<00:02:56.389> so<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:57.260> definitely<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.159> just

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
polishes so you definitely have to just

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.679 
polishes so you definitely have to just
try<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.150> out<00:02:59.379> this<00:03:00.379> pink<00:03:00.769> color<00:03:01.159> is<00:03:01.970> actually

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
one of my favorite ones to use for water

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.949 
one of my favorite ones to use for water
marbling<00:03:05.120> um<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:07.069> way<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.669> spreads<00:03:08.269> with<00:03:08.629> some

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
marbling um the way it spreads with some

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.009 
marbling um the way it spreads with some
of<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> other<00:03:09.409> ones<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.099> it<00:03:10.489> spreads

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
of the other ones is that it spreads

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.659 
of the other ones is that it spreads
kind<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.139> differently<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:13.010> doesn't<00:03:13.400> really

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
kind of differently it doesn't really

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.849 
kind of differently it doesn't really
spread<00:03:14.150> um<00:03:15.159> like<00:03:16.159> right<00:03:16.609> away<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:18.169> can<00:03:18.590> work

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
spread um like right away so it can work

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.009 
spread um like right away so it can work
for<00:03:18.889> some<00:03:19.370> different<00:03:20.150> looks<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:20.870> you're

for some different looks that you're
going<00:03:21.349> for

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
going for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.379

use for some of my designs I think

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.430 
use for some of my designs I think
there's<00:03:28.400> like<00:03:28.699> a<00:03:28.909> one<00:03:29.239> flower<00:03:29.629> water<00:03:30.109> mop

water<00:03:30.889> marble<00:03:31.400> tutorial<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.329> did<00:03:32.629> that<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
water marble tutorial that I did that I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.770 
water marble tutorial that I did that I
use<00:03:33.079> this<00:03:33.349> one<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.829> worked<00:03:34.159> perfectly<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.540> this

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
use this one it worked perfectly so this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.140 
use this one it worked perfectly so this
one<00:03:36.049> kind<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.409> varies<00:03:36.799> but<00:03:37.579> this<00:03:37.729> one<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
one kind of varies but this one is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.080 
one kind of varies but this one is
relatively<00:03:39.019> cheap<00:03:39.139> as<00:03:39.590> well<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:40.129> like<00:03:40.310> $1.99

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
relatively cheap as well it's like $1.99

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.449 
relatively cheap as well it's like $1.99
so<00:03:41.780> that's<00:03:42.169> one<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.590> ones<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.979> highly

cheap I think this particular bottle is
like<00:04:23.419> 97<00:04:24.320> cent<00:04:24.590> which<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:25.039> very<00:04:25.310> cheap

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
like 97 cent which is very cheap

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.860

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
a few times with them in water but it

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.290 
a few times with them in water but it
didn't<00:04:48.620> work<00:04:48.770> out<00:04:48.979> for<00:04:49.040> me<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.400> plus<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.090> just

nail polish for water marbling because

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.060 
nail polish for water marbling because

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
you do end up using quite a bit so I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.219

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
also any kind of fast dry formula would

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.740 
also any kind of fast dry formula would

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650
