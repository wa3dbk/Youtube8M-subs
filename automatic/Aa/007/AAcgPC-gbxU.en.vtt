00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 then next so-called 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 anticipation straight there I am 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 because you can claim as one 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 Anticipating anticipating means anticipating 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 just the situation ahead of you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 what happens next only one now 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.160
 For example, if I bottle now 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.430
 included and anticipated would be yes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.109
 now that one of you knows 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 from a signal from me where i find this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 ding now if 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.539
 Look or think too little 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 that does not throw but not enough 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.160
 I would throw to life I throw 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.160
 I want to please 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.160
 But since we are that is exactly the topic 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.690
 in football if I have a technique form 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.309
 by for as adopted i am here 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.840
 defender of the right wing 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.860
 ball and plays to the right 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.290
 outside linebacker 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.690
 what do i do before i go behind it 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.860
 in 95% before I play there 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.470
 I look there then what do I do that 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.809
 ball comes over from left to right 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.070
 what does he have to pass then 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.780
 somehow playing it seemed already 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.890
 down and now I change mine 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.149
 Decision no longer 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 that means what can I do now 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.110
 playmaker now start running 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.470
 contact I was exactly what I grew up 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.539
 about that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.330
 and that is anticipating if I am now 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.270
 knows that the signal for the next 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.340
 pass i look there now i feel 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.619
 and I'm on the way then can 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 you get the thing and I claim 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.470
 if I want to get even faster 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.720
 I have to learn the signals first 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.640
 smart to read if I know that okay 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.220
 signal for anticipate when pass from 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.349
 he is looking at him fullback 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.750
 At least there is an exception to it 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.910
 was heard before it is the no look 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.830
 pass and that is why the concept comes 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.959
 that would be exactly where I derived 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.300
 I do not want to say this 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:56.009
 look at the anticipation of mine 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.239
 take away and now this 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.959
 has developed forms of training dealer 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:04.239
 I have called above arise whose 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.920
 The ball is horizontal with ball 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.020
 move between the hat and me 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.670
 Customers have a stand without ball allowed 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.650
 also move between the hat 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 then a third and the more or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 less is that is the middle is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.410
 between these two girls and the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.050
 may also move horizontally 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.830
 but has the task only on the basis of 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.879
 Looking up from him up there 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.530
 determine where is the rear 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.150
 or in this pass too 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.069
 prevent 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.719
 It would be in game situations now 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.790
 Some had was that is mine 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.499
 attacking midfielder and it is 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.030
 the striker and the one who wants to be vertical 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.219
 play through and now I can all here 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.329
 look at the whole time as 78 yes where 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.099
 is now the striker right before left 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.030
 but I have to take the fixpunkt 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.769
 have to face him 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.359
 and now I can do it all 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.790
 carry on in what I say now 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:53.019
 it's even closer to a pen 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.700
 the emmental situation is simple 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.239
 cut out that means the situation the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.849
 one had had grad pass from 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.500
 defender fits from 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.909
 defender here on the striker 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.049
 Now he is moving here and wants to 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.969
 prevent this pass 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:12.159
 now we have said that before 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:14.199
 Number 7 has both a horizontal 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.579
 fixed point this is the defender where 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.680
 he just move right and left 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.939
 must and also has vertical 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.230
 fixed the offensive 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.310
 midfielder was up and down 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.900
 to move down 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.159
 and now theoretically it could 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.790
 make that cut I say so now 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.569
 I have to get out of the situation 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.669
 take it with you now 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.799
 and now I can say okay I have to 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.479
 Anticipate the way and maybe the 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.159
 to anticipate that means that I am here 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.689
 come to the bba'ler oberrhein and so on 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.939
 Can I do more or with the defender 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.560
 the typical cover before 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.909
 The striker has the ball then I have 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.040
 Of course not build like this 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.049
 but then there is the pass receiver 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.759
 Here is the passport holder and he has 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.620
 the task then based on the view and 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.879
 so on to determine a date 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.150
 I come before him rainer holmer 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:58.060
 the ball and so I claim that I 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.040
 can also anticipate and learn 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.900
 everything unfavorable if I'm more okay 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.269
 what are in the signals what I have to 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.189
 then I even get one 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.889
 I think that is relatively young and 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.930
 if I teach it that way 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.280
 find out how someone is the situation 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.780
 maybe ten 20,000 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.799
 played through and does not know what 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.870
 He probably let me go 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.340
 just as was but that a thousand 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.349
 times happened to me without me 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.530
 I knew that already knew that 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.270
 perceived how in the past I know that 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.530
 I can say that to the players 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.700
 to provide the children earlier 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.080
 task is we stand between the 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.570
 white hat one of them must go there 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 stand so you're moving here now 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.780
 right left with ball and I have to 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.640
 by your movement that is the 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.410
 note horizontal shift line ok 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.470
 where is the other and when you are high then 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.540
 is I always know where the stands about 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.100
 and if you fit, you have to go down 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.930
 Unlock the team is and 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.710
 move accordingly and try that 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.780
 to hold ball 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.780
 Just make it my okay as a test
