00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.160
 have the figures 260 and one of shape 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.650
 to create as many as possible with 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.380
 four figures the way you like it 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.049
 to think is that I'm trying to get the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.539
 As many as possible I have to put 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.380
 the largest number in the positional value 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.020
 high 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 so if it is a number of four 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.240
 numbers 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.699
 he is the number of 123 four figures 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.599
 What I put here is going to represent the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.550
 thousands 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 What I put here represents the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 hundreds of what I put here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.239
 represents the dozens and finally here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 represents the units 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 so I want to maximize the number of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 thousands who have for example those the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.710
 greater number is 6 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 I could turn into 6600 or 60 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 and still in 6 but not even the largest number 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.199
 possible then I must turn into 6 thousand 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.910
 note that if I put any other 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 number in this positional value 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.799
 if I put 10 there I would have none 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.930
 thousand if I put 12 would have only 2 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 thousand if one would only have 1,000 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.820
 definitely 6 thousand will be the biggest 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.340
 number that any other created as 20 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
 or a position of the thousand and using the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 same logic I want the next number 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 higher in the hundredth position 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.590
 the next number that is the largest here is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 I'll put the two here soon. 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.729
 I'd rather have two hundred than zero 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.049
 hundreds or a hundred it goes 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.729
 increase the number 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.500
 then using the same idea let's 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.970
 put the next highest number in the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 ten's position 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.189
 I'd rather have a dozen than zero 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.540
 tens let's put the zero here then 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 so the result is 6210 if people 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.090
 wanted to create the smallest number of 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.229
 same four bodies was only 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 redistribute in order to have the lowest 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 possible in the position of humiliating the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.430
 number in the unit position 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:06.689
 therefore as few as possible would be 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:08.459
 watch out here 0 1226 turn and flip 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.979
 order the smallest number with these 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.780
 agencies would be 126 but did not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.890
 for us to do it but find the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.380
 largest possible 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.380
 then the answer is 6210
