00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.730
 pain we speak evil of the century but everything 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 simply because we have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 exactly the opposite behavior of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 our very historical ancestor him 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.329

 ask these groups a lot 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 muscle so to develop them his 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 muscles allowed to support skateboarding 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.880
 when we are in pain 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.920
 of sport so that's one of the big 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.890
 received ideas from the last thirty years 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.930

 wear out prematurely if you do not 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.880
 not because you have 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.650
 deep muscles that support the
