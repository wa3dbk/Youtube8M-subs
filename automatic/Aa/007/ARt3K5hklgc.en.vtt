00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 I thank you again because the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.470
 to join sergio alvarez moya and you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.540
 did you want to be a substitute 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.309
 still a lot of luxury for us I have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 applied for substitute and I was for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.660
 hysterically ya well because that's it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.660
 it is already and of which one can be to be 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.490
 here sergio alvarez moya and kamel just 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.810
 a little word behind the scenes I have not been 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 annoyed with dirk demeersman because he 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.179
 went out furiously for doing this 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.740
 fault by saying chalezeule scheider you 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.200
 on the German version of the word of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 cambronne in ten years that had been so 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.719
 stride that had to be done and that they 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 were too short what he was there 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 furious against him even thank you sergio 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 alvarez moya so carlo 273 he how much 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.500
 goal to the meter sergio 2.91 it is little 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 but therefore 16th place in the provisional and its 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.079
 country spain and the a8 to 8th place 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.789
 with 11 points this is a game that has made 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.359
 a super frame and harry makes a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 little fault on the last one and I think 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.420
 that even at the end of the test the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 ground has deteriorated a little bit in the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.470
 twists and all that is the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.440
 comment from stevie at the exit of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 track 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.160
 I had a big world in the eye I 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.520
 did not take when I saw the state of the 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.630
 ground 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 everyone who took this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.500
 distance from there mistakes and I have 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 preferred to secure quit to lose a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.600
 second but what had the Spanish is 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.610
 well in time all that is well 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 managed attention last as said 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:39.070
 at the moment at g10 beautiful course 85 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.110
 56 for Spanish what has happened 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.700
 spent this season you have not seen 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.140
 because she calls 13 he was so 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.920
 content he went straight on he has 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.910
 jumped from there I have not seen well played sergio 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.650
 alvarez moya 4 273 85 56 and a score 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.560
 Virgin 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.870
 it's amazing how the levels and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.240
 when leaders had long intervals 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.910
 nations that are still in the running of 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.160
 better because there with that 3,4 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.390
 Cavalli we just saw 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.390
 dinning and spanish 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.630
 we feel on all 4 points will cost 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.580
 very very expensive acts of mans is without 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.310
 stop that advanced bars on ogier 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 that's what we said after the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.150
 recognition and after the good horses 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.440
 obviously the first batch between 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 individual and first teams 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.020
 are obviously nas formation 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.340
 much less seasoned but here it is 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.340
 without fail and then certainly
