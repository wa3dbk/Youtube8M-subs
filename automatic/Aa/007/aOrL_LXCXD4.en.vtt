00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.240 
pound calling and that so I'm going to
bury<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.310> bound<00:01:14.640> calling<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.690> deep

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
bury a bound calling now see how deep

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.600 
bury a bound calling now see how deep
this<00:01:17.250> big<00:01:18.000> coil<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.010> see<00:01:20.010> in<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> bit

Claire<00:03:33.129> is<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> guy<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.519> clear<00:03:41.280> yeah<00:03:42.280> I

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
mean this is with the big coil but I

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.409 
mean this is with the big coil but I
still<00:04:08.620> think<00:04:08.919> that<00:04:08.979> the<00:04:09.220> I've<00:04:09.879> seen<00:04:09.940> video

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
still think that the I've seen video

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.789 
still think that the I've seen video
there<00:04:10.919> on<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.189> normal<00:04:12.549> coil<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.930> gets<00:04:14.439> it<00:04:14.590> like

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
there on the normal coil it gets it like

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.969 
there on the normal coil it gets it like
10<00:04:15.159> this<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.519> about<00:04:15.669> 10<00:04:15.939> 11<00:04:16.060> inches<00:04:16.510> down

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
10 this is about 10 11 inches down

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:26.689 
10 this is about 10 11 inches down
that's<00:04:17.979> clear

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.610 

well<00:04:27.699> happy<00:04:27.970> with<00:04:28.090> that

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:40.360 

it's<00:04:31.620> in<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.770> bit

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
