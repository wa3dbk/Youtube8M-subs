00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
characters will start with gummy I mean

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
characters will start with gummy I mean
he's<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> toothless<00:01:54.869> alligator<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.860> what's<00:01:56.159> not

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
he's a toothless alligator so what's not

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
he's a toothless alligator so what's not
to<00:01:56.490> love<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:57.570> until<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> point<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.530> always

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to love up until this point I always

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
to love up until this point I always
thought<00:01:58.890> gummy<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.939> smart<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.540> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
thought gummy was really smart but just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
thought gummy was really smart but just
didn't<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.320> anything<00:02:01.590> about<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> crazy<00:02:02.430> stuff

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
didn't do anything about the crazy stuff

didn't do anything about the crazy stuff
that<00:02:02.759> pinky<00:02:03.149> does<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.469> episode<00:02:04.740> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that pinky does but in this episode I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
that pinky does but in this episode I
realized<00:02:05.310> he<00:02:05.820> probably<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.630> clueless<00:02:06.899> as

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
realized he probably is as clueless as

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.020 
realized he probably is as clueless as
he<00:02:07.380> seems<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.489> makes<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
he seems and that just makes him all the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
he seems and that just makes him all the
more<00:02:09.179> adorable<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.989> mean<00:02:10.289> look<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.470> him<00:02:10.560> sit

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
more adorable I mean look at him sit

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.100 
more adorable I mean look at him sit
there<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> cupcake<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.550> his<00:02:11.700> head

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
there with a cupcake on his head

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.650 
there with a cupcake on his head
you<00:02:12.770> don't<00:02:12.920> even<00:02:13.010> care<00:02:13.810> three<00:02:14.810> four<00:02:15.170> five<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
you don't even care three four five and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.440 
you don't even care three four five and
now<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.200> Angel<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.670> episode<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.270> actually

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
now for Angel in this episode I actually

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.350 
now for Angel in this episode I actually
realized<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.170> genuinely<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:22.160> hate<00:02:22.760> angel

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
realized that I genuinely do hate angel

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.930 
realized that I genuinely do hate angel
and<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.720> always<00:02:23.900> will<00:02:24.460> admittedly<00:02:25.460> he<00:02:25.670> did<00:02:25.820> let

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I always will admittedly he did let

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.580 
and I always will admittedly he did let
them<00:02:26.090> go<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> crystal<00:02:26.720> Empire<00:02:26.990> though<00:02:27.200> so

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
them go to the crystal Empire though so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.210 
them go to the crystal Empire though so
I<00:02:27.860> guess<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.790> was<00:02:29.030> pretty<00:02:29.150> cool<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:30.980> for

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
I guess that was pretty cool now for

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.640 
I guess that was pretty cool now for
Winona<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:32.240> not<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> dog<00:02:32.840> person<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.560> when

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
real cats maybe a tiny bit exaggerated

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.280 
real cats maybe a tiny bit exaggerated
but<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.200> tiny<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:01.420> will<00:03:02.420> licious<00:03:02.840> I'm

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
but just a tiny bit I will licious I'm

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.110 
but just a tiny bit I will licious I'm
pretty<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.770> Twilight<00:03:04.250> should<00:03:04.489> have<00:03:04.610> paid<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
pretty sure Twilight should have paid a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.270 
pretty sure Twilight should have paid a
licious<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:06.110> take<00:03:06.260> care<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.500> spike<00:03:06.800> instead

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
the other way around and I think that's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.500 
the other way around and I think that's
pretty<00:03:09.140> self-explanatory<00:03:10.510> considering

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
pretty self-explanatory considering

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.220
