I<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.310> thinking<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:24.109> yes<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.350> had<00:00:46.700> turned

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
I was thinking about yes I had turned

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
I was thinking about yes I had turned
into<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> project<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.890> as<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.010> used<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.080 

well<00:00:53.219> maybe<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:53.730> ask<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.059> questions

well maybe I can't ask it questions
specifically<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> human<00:00:55.530> oils<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.949> Bible

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
specifically on human oils of the Bible

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.750 
specifically on human oils of the Bible
huh

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
huh

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.560 
huh
I've<00:00:57.000> done<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> research<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
I've done a lot of research into the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
I've done a lot of research into the
historical<00:01:00.570> periods<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
historical periods back then and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
historical periods back then and
probably<00:01:02.070> started<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.699> before<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.120> even<00:01:03.180> knew

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
probably started with before I even knew

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
probably started with before I even knew
about<00:01:03.510> such<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> oils<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.320> cite<00:01:04.559> shamanism<00:01:05.159> apply

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
about such a oils I cite shamanism apply

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420 
about such a oils I cite shamanism apply
annealing<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> years<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.100> which

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
annealing for a lot of years and which

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
annealing for a lot of years and which
naturally<00:01:09.119> led<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> essential<00:01:10.290> oils

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
naturally led into the essential oils

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.980 
naturally led into the essential oils
and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.790> back<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.360> these<00:01:12.600> ancient

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and then going back into these ancient

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
and then going back into these ancient
times<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> use<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> oils<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:15.030> opened

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
times with the use of oils they opened

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
times with the use of oils they opened
up<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> whole<00:01:15.960> investor<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.890> me<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.700> um<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
up this whole investor for me so um you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
up this whole investor for me so um you
know<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> think<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.710> know<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> ancient

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
know what I think we know the ancient

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.770 
know what I think we know the ancient
days<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.140> tiny<00:01:22.500> fraction<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
days it's just a tiny fraction so in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.530 
days it's just a tiny fraction so in
your<00:01:25.229> research<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.189> appears<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.729> you've

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
your research it appears that you've

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
your research it appears that you've
uncovered<00:01:28.490> not<00:01:29.490> only<00:01:29.729> did<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.119> onto<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
uncovered not only did you go onto the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
uncovered not only did you go onto the
Bible<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.259> were<00:01:31.380> able<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.799> dig<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.520> some

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Bible but you were able to dig into some

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.680 
Bible but you were able to dig into some
probably<00:01:33.420> lesser<00:01:33.869> available

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
probably lesser available

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.840 
probably lesser available

the public tax and travel different

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.260 
the public tax and travel different
translations<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:38.020> maybe<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.950> could<00:01:39.100> just

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
translations and maybe you could just

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.410 
translations and maybe you could just
just<00:01:40.270> briefly<00:01:41.400> elucidate<00:01:42.400> on<00:01:42.640> what<00:01:43.120> some<00:01:43.330> of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
just briefly elucidate on what some of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.510 
just briefly elucidate on what some of
the<00:01:43.510> things<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.930> found<00:01:44.320> when<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.710> dug<00:01:45.010> deeper

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the things you found when you dug deeper

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.850 
the things you found when you dug deeper
behind<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.210> scriptures<00:01:46.780> behind<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.410> Bible

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
behind the scriptures behind the Bible

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.890 
behind the scriptures behind the Bible
what<00:01:48.040> what<00:01:48.400> did<00:01:48.550> you<00:01:48.640> find<00:01:48.910> about<00:01:49.090> anointing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
what what did you find about anointing

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.100 
what what did you find about anointing
and<00:01:50.140> essential<00:01:50.890> oils<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.460> was<00:01:51.610> happening

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and essential oils that was happening

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.570 
and essential oils that was happening
well<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.140> think<00:01:53.440> that<00:01:53.650> got<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.220> there

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
well I think that got out of that there

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.170 
well I think that got out of that there
was<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:55.180> lot<00:01:55.600> more<00:01:55.630> oils<00:01:56.440> used<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.640> biblical

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
was a lot more oils used in biblical

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
times that are mentioned by the Bible

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.330 
times that are mentioned by the Bible

found out by reading some Egyptian and
Roman<00:05:02.830> dates<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:04.780> put<00:05:05.020> salt<00:05:05.320> in<00:05:05.860> the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
Roman dates that they put salt in the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.540 
Roman dates that they put salt in the
incense<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:07.540> sort<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:07.960> water<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:09.520> the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
incense to sort of water so the

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.570 
incense to sort of water so the
incidence<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:10.330> rather<00:05:11.190> because<00:05:12.190> I've<00:05:12.340> burned

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
incidence but rather because I've burned

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.770 
incidence but rather because I've burned
better

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
better

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.030 
better
and<00:05:14.350> so<00:05:14.620> I've<00:05:15.340> never<00:05:15.400> gotten<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.830> he<00:05:17.830> put

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
and so I've never gotten to that he put

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.940 
and so I've never gotten to that he put
it<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.220> his<00:05:18.310> recipe
