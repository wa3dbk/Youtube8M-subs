been a period and it dies you send it
that<00:02:01.890> sign<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.579> us<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> we'll<00:02:03.060> say

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
that sign back to us and we'll say

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
that sign back to us and we'll say
placement<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:03.950> no<00:02:04.070> charge<00:02:04.720> behind<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
products that 1% the signs are easy to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.640 
products that 1% the signs are easy to
come<00:02:08.360> ready<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.720> run<00:02:08.960> there's<00:02:09.260> very<00:02:09.470> little

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.650 
come ready to run there's very little

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.800 
come ready to run there's very little
work<00:02:09.920> install<00:02:10.490> them<00:02:10.670> basically<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.600> just

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
work install them basically you just

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.510 
work install them basically you just
have<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.050> cut<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> small<00:02:12.620> slot<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.160> building

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
have to cut a small slot in the building

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.850 
have to cut a small slot in the building
the<00:02:13.610> width<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.000> connector<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.350> set<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
the width of the connector you set it in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.920 
the width of the connector you set it in
there<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.670> glue<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.090> place<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.570> put<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
there you glue it in place you put the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.740 
there you glue it in place you put the
supports<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.890> comes<00:02:19.070> with<00:02:19.220> supports<00:02:19.750> this

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
supports if it comes with supports this

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.110 
supports if it comes with supports this
is<00:02:20.900> your<00:02:21.050> ready<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.350> run<00:02:21.620> electronics<00:02:22.310> again

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
is your ready to run electronics again

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
is your ready to run electronics again
nothing<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.050> put<00:02:24.170> some<00:02:24.230> batteries<00:02:24.680> in

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
nothing to do but put some batteries in

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.410 
nothing to do but put some batteries in
we<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.490> some<00:02:25.640> options<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.090> get<00:02:26.240> rid<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we have some options to get rid of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.570 
we have some options to get rid of
batteries<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.740> just<00:02:27.890> plug<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.340> just

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
batteries and you just plug it you just

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.070 
batteries and you just plug it you just
plug<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> sign<00:02:29.150> into<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> connector<00:02:29.990> from

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
plug the sign into the connector from

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.620 
plug the sign into the connector from
underneath<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.710> it's<00:02:30.980> ready<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.370> go<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.880> it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
underneath and it's ready to go and it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
underneath and it's ready to go and it
adds<00:02:32.780> quite<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:33.050> bit<00:02:33.320> we<00:02:33.530> find<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.040> most
