and<00:00:33.180> i<00:00:33.329> got<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.539> idea<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> fly<00:00:34.999> from

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
and i got the idea from this fly from

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.270 
and i got the idea from this fly from
seeing<00:00:36.269> on<00:00:36.600> actually<00:00:37.589> blue<00:00:37.769> ribbon<00:00:38.069> flies

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
seeing on actually blue ribbon flies

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
seeing on actually blue ribbon flies
website<00:00:38.789> that<00:00:38.999> they<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.239> come<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.659> with<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
website that they had come out with a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.139 
website that they had come out with a
royal<00:00:40.319> Trude<00:00:40.649> cripple<00:00:41.069> and<00:00:41.429> i<00:00:41.819> thought<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
royal Trude cripple and i thought to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.459 
royal Trude cripple and i thought to
myself<00:00:42.179> wow<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.839> a<00:00:42.960> good<00:00:43.109> idea

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
myself wow that's a good idea

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.910 
myself wow that's a good idea
and<00:00:44.479> I've<00:00:45.479> never<00:00:45.719> actually<00:00:45.929> seen<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> fly<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and I've never actually seen that fly in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.200 
and I've never actually seen that fly in
the<00:00:47.010> flesh<00:00:47.249> but<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.699> kind<00:00:47.999> of<00:00:48.030> saw<00:00:48.179> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the flesh but I just kind of saw the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.059 
the flesh but I just kind of saw the
idea<00:00:48.479> for<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:49.139> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> decided<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.739> run<00:00:49.859> with

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
idea for it and so I decided to run with

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.369 
idea for it and so I decided to run with
it<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.850> exactly<00:00:51.210> sure<00:00:51.479> what<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:51.989> differences

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it not exactly sure what the differences

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.419 
it not exactly sure what the differences
are<00:00:52.530> between<00:00:52.589> this<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.370> one

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
are between this one and that one

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.340 
are between this one and that one
besides<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.269> this<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.659> actually<00:00:55.049> isn't<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
besides that this one actually isn't a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.329 
besides that this one actually isn't a
royal<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> fair<00:00:58.589> chances<00:00:58.949> I'll<00:00:59.039> wind<00:00:59.249> up

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

stuff from different manufacturers it's

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.679 
stuff from different manufacturers it's
all<00:01:31.590> fairly<00:01:31.799> similar<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.420> color

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
all fairly similar and I like this color

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
all fairly similar and I like this color
because<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.799> brighter<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because it's a little brighter than the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.649 
because it's a little brighter than the
Gold's<00:01:36.060> elon<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> used<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.829> clock<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.219> Cadiz

Gold's elon I used on the clock of Cadiz

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
Gold's elon I used on the clock of Cadiz
and<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.929> think<00:01:40.140> suggest<00:01:40.469> more<00:01:40.710> an<00:01:40.950> egg<00:01:41.399> sac<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and I think suggest more an egg sac and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
and I think suggest more an egg sac and
one<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.109> the<00:01:43.170> reasons<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> wanted<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
one of the reasons I wanted that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.919 
one of the reasons I wanted that
brighter<00:01:44.100> colors<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.969> I<00:01:45.000> click<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.719> tail

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
brighter colors because I click the tail

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.760 
brighter colors because I click the tail
very<00:01:46.140> short<00:01:46.499> on<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.799> fly<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.820> about<00:01:48.590> half<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
very short on this fly just about half a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
very short on this fly just about half a
gate<00:01:49.979> maybe<00:01:50.249> even<00:01:50.460> less<00:01:50.579> than<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.210> just

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
gate maybe even less than that so just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
gate maybe even less than that so just
more<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.749> tough<00:01:51.960> than<00:01:52.170> anything<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> body

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
more of a tough than anything the body

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
more of a tough than anything the body
on<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.329> fly<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:55.939> natural<00:01:56.939> peacock<00:01:57.509> Arizona

basically this fly is kind of the little
brother<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.250> clock<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.730> cádiz<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:23.210> in

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
brother to the clock of cádiz which in

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.840 
brother to the clock of cádiz which in
turn<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.720> little<00:02:23.930> brother<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.410> Trude<00:02:24.850> we

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
turn is a little brother to the Trude we

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.910 
turn is a little brother to the Trude we
really<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.360> our<00:02:26.600> peacock<00:02:27.140> body<00:02:27.410> dry<00:02:27.680> flies

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920

around<00:02:28.100> here<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:30.500> peacock<00:02:30.830> ish<00:02:31.070> bodied<00:02:31.430> I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
around here or peacock ish bodied I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.710 
around here or peacock ish bodied I
guess<00:02:31.730> cuz<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:31.970> one<00:02:32.030> actually<00:02:32.270> isn't<00:02:32.630> real

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
guess cuz this one actually isn't real

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
that those those wings separate there

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.979 
that those those wings separate there
and<00:03:57.830> then<00:03:58.459> over<00:03:58.700> wrap<00:03:59.030> all<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.270> that<00:03:59.510> back<00:03:59.810> to

and then over wrap all of that back to

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.800 
and then over wrap all of that back to
your<00:04:00.110> body<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.489> you're<00:04:01.640> tying<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:02.000> semi<00:04:02.390> spent

rather than directly over the back and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.790 
rather than directly over the back and
when<00:04:05.570> you're<00:04:05.690> all<00:04:05.810> all<00:04:06.110> done<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.590> should<00:04:06.739> look

when you're all all done it should look

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.040 
when you're all all done it should look
about<00:04:07.130> like<00:04:07.310> that

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.770 

and<00:04:11.590> then<00:04:11.800> I'm<00:04:12.640> going<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.820> trim<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.180> about

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
and then I'm going to trim that about

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:24.060 
and then I'm going to trim that about
halfway<00:04:14.110> down<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.500> tail<00:04:15.510> roughly<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
halfway down the tail roughly so that I

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.860 
halfway down the tail roughly so that I
want<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.340> look<00:04:24.460> about<00:04:24.670> like<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.600> for<00:04:28.780> now

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
want to look about like that and for now

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.050 
want to look about like that and for now
I'm<00:04:28.990> going<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.170> leave<00:04:29.290> that<00:04:29.530> loop<00:04:30.060> sitting

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
I'm going to leave that loop sitting

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.700 
I'm going to leave that loop sitting
there<00:04:31.210> at<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.330> front<00:04:31.600> I've<00:04:31.870> got<00:04:32.260> one<00:04:32.500> more<00:04:32.530> job

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
there at the front I've got one more job

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.080 
there at the front I've got one more job
to<00:04:33.370> do<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:36.010> then<00:04:36.130> my<00:04:36.280> hackle<00:04:36.820> is

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
to do with that and then my hackle is

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.280 
to do with that and then my hackle is
Cochin<00:04:37.600> Brown

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
Cochin Brown

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.290 
Cochin Brown
I'll<00:04:38.680> also<00:04:38.950> tie<00:04:39.220> it<00:04:39.280> with<00:04:39.520> coachmen<00:04:40.150> dyed

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
I'll also tie it with coachmen dyed

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.850 
I'll also tie it with coachmen dyed
grizzly<00:04:40.750> brown<00:04:42.750> brown<00:04:43.750> tie<00:04:43.930> herb<00:04:44.140> grizzly

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
grizzly brown brown tie herb grizzly

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.400 
grizzly brown brown tie herb grizzly
dyed<00:04:45.040> coachmen<00:04:45.520> Brown<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.730> should<00:04:46.030> say<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:47.290> now

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
dyed coachmen Brown I should say so now

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.140 
dyed coachmen Brown I should say so now
I've<00:04:47.590> advanced<00:04:47.980> my<00:04:48.070> thread<00:04:48.370> after<00:04:48.550> tying<00:04:48.880> that

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
I've advanced my thread after tying that

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.930 
I've advanced my thread after tying that
hackle<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.690> kind<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.080> made<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.760> loop

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
hackle and I kind of made the the loop

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.660 
hackle and I kind of made the the loop
portion<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.570> wing<00:04:52.750> go<00:04:53.140> up<00:04:53.320> right<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:54.460> make

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
portion of the wing go up right and make

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.830 
portion of the wing go up right and make
a<00:04:54.700> couple<00:04:54.910> turns<00:04:55.180> right<00:04:55.390> around<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.720> base

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
a couple turns right around the base

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.330 
a couple turns right around the base
here<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.290> make<00:04:56.620> sure<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.950> stays<00:04:57.160> together

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
here to make sure that stays together

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:08.040 
here to make sure that stays together
and<00:04:58.020> then<00:05:00.330> trim<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.450> off<00:05:01.510> about<00:05:02.500> like<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:07.050> and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and then trim that off about like so and

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.230 
and then trim that off about like so and
one<00:05:08.680> thing<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:08.860> does<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.520> didn't<00:05:09.790> superglue

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
one thing that does I didn't superglue

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.910 
one thing that does I didn't superglue
this<00:05:10.390> as<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.690> do<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.960> on<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.080> clock<00:05:11.380> gun<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:11.770> this

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
this as I do it on the clock gun so this

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.040 
this as I do it on the clock gun so this
leaving<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.910> bud<00:05:13.060> ends<00:05:13.330> like<00:05:13.480> that<00:05:13.510> will<00:05:13.900> help

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
leaving the bud ends like that will help

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.990 
leaving the bud ends like that will help
it<00:05:14.170> stay<00:05:14.320> together<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:15.160> also<00:05:15.310> creates<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.880> bit

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
it stay together it also creates a bit

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.550 
it stay together it also creates a bit
of<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.150> waking<00:05:16.360> post<00:05:16.720> if<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.930> want<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.170> move<00:05:17.290> the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
of a waking post if you want to move the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.250 
of a waking post if you want to move the
move<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.340> fly<00:05:18.550> when<00:05:18.700> you're<00:05:18.820> fishing<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.270> also

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
move the fly when you're fishing it also

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.350 
move the fly when you're fishing it also
creates<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:21.040> kind<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.250> an<00:05:21.340> indicator<00:05:21.700> so

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
creates just kind of an indicator so

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.850 
creates just kind of an indicator so
I'll<00:05:22.480> take<00:05:22.570> my<00:05:22.630> hackle<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:25.470> about<00:05:26.470> five<00:05:26.710> or

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
I'll take my hackle and about five or

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.690 
I'll take my hackle and about five or
six<00:05:26.950> turns<00:05:27.220> behind<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.820> wing<00:05:27.970> but<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:29.290> then

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
six turns behind the wing but and then

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:42.420 
six turns behind the wing but and then
one<00:05:30.700> full<00:05:31.060> turn<00:05:31.300> ahead<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.780> winning

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.390 

and<00:05:43.430> then<00:05:43.520> final<00:05:43.849> step<00:05:44.800> I'll<00:05:45.800> final<00:05:46.129> step<00:05:46.279> in

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
and then final step I'll final step in

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.129 
and then final step I'll final step in
tying<00:05:46.610> anyway<00:05:47.169> go<00:05:48.169> ahead<00:05:48.289> make<00:05:48.409> a<00:05:48.469> wood<00:05:48.680> finish

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.619 

and<00:05:54.490> then<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.819> last<00:05:55.999> thing<00:05:56.240> I'm<00:05:56.360> going<00:05:56.449> to<00:05:56.509> do

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
and then the last thing I'm going to do

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.299 
and then the last thing I'm going to do
here<00:05:56.869> is<00:05:57.080> take<00:05:57.379> my<00:05:57.559> scissors<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:58.099> trim<00:05:58.219> a

00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:58.309 
here is take my scissors and trim a

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.790 
here is take my scissors and trim a
v-notch<00:05:58.699> on<00:05:59.689> the<00:05:59.839> bottom<00:06:00.139> side<00:06:00.319> of<00:06:00.379> the<00:06:00.559> fly

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
v-notch on the bottom side of the fly

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.749 
v-notch on the bottom side of the fly
and<00:06:01.099> get<00:06:01.189> any<00:06:01.369> of<00:06:01.460> those<00:06:01.550> those<00:06:03.309> body<00:06:04.309> fibers

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
and get any of those those body fibers

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.219 
and get any of those those body fibers
that<00:06:04.849> are<00:06:04.909> sticking<00:06:05.210> out<00:06:05.270> too<00:06:05.449> far<00:06:05.479> and<00:06:05.899> that's

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
that are sticking out too far and that's

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.049 
that are sticking out too far and that's
going<00:06:06.379> to<00:06:06.439> help<00:06:06.559> the<00:06:06.949> fly<00:06:07.159> sit<00:06:07.430> flush<00:06:07.759> in<00:06:07.939> the

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:08.059 
going to help the fly sit flush in the

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.459 
going to help the fly sit flush in the
film<00:06:08.300> like<00:06:08.509> I<00:06:08.629> said<00:06:08.809> this<00:06:08.899> is<00:06:09.050> kind<00:06:09.259> of<00:06:09.379> a

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
film like I said this is kind of a

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.209 
film like I said this is kind of a
crippled<00:06:11.050> stillborn<00:06:12.050> type<00:06:12.289> maybe<00:06:12.800> maybe<00:06:12.979> even

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
crippled stillborn type maybe maybe even

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.129 
crippled stillborn type maybe maybe even
a<00:06:13.279> kind<00:06:13.460> of<00:06:13.520> spinner<00:06:13.789> type<00:06:14.059> fly<00:06:14.330> and<00:06:14.599> so<00:06:15.080> you

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
a kind of spinner type fly and so you

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.629 
a kind of spinner type fly and so you
want<00:06:15.379> that<00:06:15.469> to<00:06:15.529> sit<00:06:15.800> nice<00:06:15.979> and<00:06:16.009> low<00:06:16.309> and<00:06:16.580> that

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
want that to sit nice and low and that

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.239 
want that to sit nice and low and that
should<00:06:17.419> be<00:06:17.569> your<00:06:17.749> vertical<00:06:18.139> profile<00:06:21.249> just

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:22.249 
should be your vertical profile just

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.279 
should be your vertical profile just
like<00:06:22.399> that<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:23.479> like<00:06:23.569> I<00:06:23.629> said<00:06:23.749> this<00:06:23.870> this<00:06:24.110> one

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
like that and like I said this this one

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.649 
like that and like I said this this one
tends<00:06:24.439> to<00:06:24.559> work<00:06:24.710> best<00:06:24.919> in<00:06:25.099> slower<00:06:25.339> water<00:06:25.669> bit

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
tends to work best in slower water bit

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.019 
tends to work best in slower water bit
best<00:06:26.870> with<00:06:27.050> it<00:06:27.229> during<00:06:27.589> cata<00:06:27.979> season<00:06:28.430> the

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
best with it during cata season the

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.089 
best with it during cata season the
clock<00:06:29.719> has<00:06:29.930> intrudes<00:06:30.289> will<00:06:30.499> do<00:06:30.649> okay<00:06:30.949> with

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
clock has intrudes will do okay with
