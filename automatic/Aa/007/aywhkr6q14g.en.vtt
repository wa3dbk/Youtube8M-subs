this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.320> pedal<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> doesn't

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this is the back pedal but it doesn't

always<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:47.759> too<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
just pull that and that works and that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
just pull that and that works and that
is<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.439> forward<00:01:52.680> pedal<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> pretty

near<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> mower<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.970> serious

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
near the mower just to be serious

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.660 
near the mower just to be serious
just<00:02:29.900> don't<00:02:30.200> ever<00:02:30.350> mow<00:02:30.620> around<00:02:30.770> your<00:02:31.040> kids<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.100 
just don't ever mow around your kids and

also<00:02:33.980> another<00:02:34.370> recommendation<00:02:34.660> shield<00:02:35.660> those

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
also another recommendation shield those

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.750 
also another recommendation shield those
all<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.410> mud<00:02:36.709> lying<00:02:37.040> around<00:02:37.190> there<00:02:37.520> that's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
all that mud lying around there that's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.160 
all that mud lying around there that's
because<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.270> tractor<00:02:38.720> has<00:02:38.810> trouble<00:02:39.140> getting

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
because the tractor has trouble getting

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.560 
because the tractor has trouble getting
out<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.100> deck<00:02:40.250> isn't<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.730> 3.5<00:02:41.270> then

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
out if the deck isn't up to 3.5 then

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.410 
out if the deck isn't up to 3.5 then
when<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.780> mow<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.230> suggest<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.100> 2.5<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.940> 2<00:02:44.150> inch

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
when you mow I suggest a 2.5 or a 2 inch

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.800 
when you mow I suggest a 2.5 or a 2 inch
cut<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.560> uh<00:02:45.590> let's<00:02:46.580> see<00:02:46.700> how<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.880> runs<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:49.810> I'll

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.949 
back it out I'm probably I might do a
small<00:02:53.570> mower

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
small mower

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.840
