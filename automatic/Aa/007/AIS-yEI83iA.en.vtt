00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
go in there order those so I've got

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.820 
go in there order those so I've got
replacements<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:24.960> also<00:00:25.200> what<00:00:25.530> I'm<00:00:25.620> going<00:00:25.770> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
replacements but also what I'm going to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.170 
replacements but also what I'm going to
be<00:00:25.890> doing<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> replacing<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:26.910> bulbs

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
be doing is replacing all these bulbs

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.840 
be doing is replacing all these bulbs
because<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.530> turn<00:00:28.710> students<00:00:29.010> come<00:00:29.190> on<00:00:29.400> but

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
because the turn students come on but

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.029 
because the turn students come on but
they<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.300> blink<00:00:30.690> so<00:00:31.440> there's<00:00:31.770> either<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
they do not blink so there's either a

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.670 
they do not blink so there's either a
problem<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> most<00:00:33.149> common<00:00:33.420> problem<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> or

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
problem the most common problem is or

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
problem the most common problem is or
the<00:00:34.829> lights<00:00:35.039> themselves<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.699> wrong<00:00:35.879> or<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.360> bad

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the lights themselves or wrong or or bad

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.520 
the lights themselves or wrong or or bad
so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.499> also<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.339> of<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:38.550> since<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
so I also got some of these since I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.049 
so I also got some of these since I
think<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.679> was<00:00:40.769> making<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.159> small<00:00:41.370> order<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.909> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
think it was making a small order and a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.549 
think it was making a small order and a
few<00:00:42.329> other<00:00:42.449> things<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.289> get<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
few other things to kind of get the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.020 
few other things to kind of get the
pre-shipping<00:00:44.100> basically<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.819> should<00:00:44.999> be

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
pre-shipping basically or it should be

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
pre-shipping basically or it should be
discount<00:00:45.569> so<00:00:46.499> to<00:00:46.559> change<00:00:47.069> these<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:47.999> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
discount so to change these just like I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.739 
discount so to change these just like I
just<00:00:48.149> did<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.979> push<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.850> turn<00:00:51.569> them

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
just did you just push them in turn them

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.090 
just did you just push them in turn them
I<00:00:51.929> mean<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.499> car<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
I mean it's just like a car and then the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
I mean it's just like a car and then the
lenses<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.639> ahead<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.799> new<00:00:58.799> screws<00:00:59.190> out

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
lenses will go ahead and new screws out

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.229 
lenses will go ahead and new screws out
of<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.809> they<00:01:01.159> dirty<00:01:02.159> clean<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.209> up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of here they dirty clean that up

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.800 
of here they dirty clean that up
eventually<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:04.589> sit<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.949> place<00:01:05.690> then<00:01:06.690> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
eventually they sit in place then you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
eventually they sit in place then you
put<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.430> screw<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:10.100> mainly<00:01:11.100> made<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
put your screw in I mainly made the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
put your screw in I mainly made the
order<00:01:11.789> to<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.210> screws<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.899> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
order to get those screws because I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.819 
order to get those screws because I
couldn't<00:01:13.259> find<00:01:13.469> them<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.039> little<00:01:14.700> shop<00:01:18.829> so

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
front that goes right on me it's kind of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.539 
front that goes right on me it's kind of
hard<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:02.989> get<00:04:03.169> this<00:04:03.290> angle<00:04:03.680> where<00:04:04.099> the<00:04:04.129> cameras

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
hard to get this angle where the cameras

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.490 
hard to get this angle where the cameras
sitting<00:04:04.819> right<00:04:05.629> on<00:04:05.659> the<00:04:05.840> horn

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.720 

like<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.280> loose<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:13.130> don't<00:04:14.130> remember<00:04:14.280> who's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
like that loose I don't remember who's

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.630 
like that loose I don't remember who's
behind<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.480> Horner<00:04:16.230> but<00:04:16.650> as<00:04:16.890> far<00:04:17.100> as<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.430> now

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
behind the Horner but as far as what now

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.560 
behind the Horner but as far as what now
to<00:04:17.700> what<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.660> mounts<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.110> horn

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
to what I think it mounts on the horn

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.670 
to what I think it mounts on the horn
yeah<00:04:24.140> look<00:04:26.990> we're<00:04:27.990> gonna<00:04:28.080> scratch<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
yeah look we're gonna scratch that

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.730 
yeah look we're gonna scratch that
before<00:04:29.010> we<00:04:29.130> get<00:04:29.220> started<00:04:36.260> go<00:04:37.260> ahead<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.560> put

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
before we get started go ahead and put

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.040 
before we get started go ahead and put
those<00:04:37.920> in<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:45.180> it's<00:04:45.360> hard<00:04:45.600> because<00:04:45.810> I'm

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
those in and it's hard because I'm

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.820 
those in and it's hard because I'm
looking<00:04:46.470> from<00:04:46.650> behind<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.400> right<00:04:47.610> now<00:04:47.850> so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
looking from behind it right now so

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.340 
looking from behind it right now so
normally<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:49.920> would<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.280> two<00:04:50.460> seconds<00:04:50.910> but

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
normally this would be two seconds but

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.780 
normally this would be two seconds but
there<00:04:52.350> we<00:04:52.440> go<00:04:52.590> boom<00:04:53.250> where<00:04:53.400> I've<00:04:53.490> got<00:04:53.670> the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
there we go boom where I've got the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.690 
there we go boom where I've got the
camera<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.890> we'll<00:04:56.040> go<00:04:56.130> ahead<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.400> get<00:04:56.550> this

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
camera so we'll go ahead and get this

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.970 
camera so we'll go ahead and get this
snug<00:04:57.060> down<00:04:57.300> got<00:04:58.170> one<00:04:58.350> more<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.620> put<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:58.890> the
