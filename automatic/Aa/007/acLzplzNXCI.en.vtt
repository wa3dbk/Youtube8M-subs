00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 hello to all brought to repair the laptop 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.019
 msi 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.809
 like this, Iâ€™ll tell you modelka g780 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.379
 But with such a story that he has 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 charger first died 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.130
 his charge is rather peculiar 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.849
 laptop is very powerful 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 charging he had a power of about 6 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 ampere that is quite powerful charger 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.149
 the device here is not to fix it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 it happened there shimko died very rarely 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.460
 and that's why the customer just ordered 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.149
 new 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.980
 new charger now with 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.450
 new charger he brought a laptop 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.920
 because the laptop is still not 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.329
 here and when connected 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 charging she goes into defense 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.750
 now that i have made a laptop i 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 Partially disassembled 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 him and the laptop started up without 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.260
 images of course but at least 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 reacted to the button that is let 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:23.460
 went video card i looked here on it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 there are already signs of repair now 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 it will be seen an hour show these here again 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 two transistors changed 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 something else 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.510
 traces of flux and already burned in here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.700
 And on nutrition walked and vidyuhi 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:55.430
 food in kozin that is completely 0 he 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.530
 now Iâ€™ll probably take off these two first 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.160
 solder transistors because they ring 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 just you all parties here and see 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:09.740
 that something else besides that, we here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 faulty well before unsoldering 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.770
 transistors I decided to watch them 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.700
 marking here and noticed the following that 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.310
 these transistors are different 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.330
 although in theory they should stand 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.240
 same one transistor 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.160
 replaced most likely at the previous 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:37.700
 repair 2 left home and here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:40.270
 replaced it with a less powerful under floor and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800
 there it is clear that 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.459
 characteristics differ not in the best 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:52.190
 native side stands here in dms 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:59.870
 03 12 here and set the transistor with 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.820
 marking p400 72 that's why i started 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.080
 with 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.260
 transistor which is less for 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:13.750
 characteristics and seems hit the mark 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.750
 we evaporate the tester is in dialing mode 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.550
 you will see the transistor just punch in 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:31.950
 both sides here and now on 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:35.910
 video card goats 19 volts gone then 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.489
 There is a problem most likely in I 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.530
 picked up 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.700
 I don't have the same transistor 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.390
 but there is in the DMS 03 08 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.420
 And from the datasheet it is clear that he even 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.360
 better performance than that 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.970
 which was originally 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.830
 Now I will clean the fee of all the mountain of 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:06.209
 2 flux and solder this new one 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.340
 transistor and so I soldered the transistor on 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.959
 a place 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:16.769
 Now I will try to put on 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:19.590
 place and see what happens 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.000
 I collected a laptop, everything works 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.750
 replacement of the transistor, we managed vidyuha 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.970
 well determined of course it 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.470
 it would be nice to drive for now 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.990
 what will i do to track the temperature 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.660
 that is, how the video x will be under load 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.090
 behave in principle, I think everything will be 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.800
 ok with him thanks for watching 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.050
 all subscribe comment 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.050
 like everyone
