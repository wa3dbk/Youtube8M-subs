00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
now we're going to rip that board into

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.940 
now we're going to rip that board into
two<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:45.970> half<00:00:46.120> inches<00:00:46.510> will<00:00:47.290> rip<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.620> twice

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
two and a half inches will rip it twice

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.920 
two and a half inches will rip it twice
to<00:00:48.280> get<00:00:48.430> two<00:00:48.760> boards<00:00:49.120> for<00:00:49.330> shot<00:00:50.050> glass<00:00:50.260> holder

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
now you take the two boards that you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.890 
now you take the two boards that you
just<00:00:59.460> cut<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.240> half<00:01:00.360> inches<00:01:00.630> wide

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
just cut it two and a half inches wide

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900 
just cut it two and a half inches wide
and<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:01.890> tape<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.400> two<00:01:02.670> boards

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and I'm gonna tape these two boards

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.150 
and I'm gonna tape these two boards
together<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.500> double<00:01:04.830> sided<00:01:05.040> tape

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
together if you have double sided tape

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.070 
together if you have double sided tape
it<00:01:05.520> would<00:01:05.640> work<00:01:05.790> best<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.780> have

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it would work best but I don't have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140 
it would work best but I don't have
double<00:01:07.350> sided<00:01:07.530> tape<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> tape<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:09.030> gonna

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
double sided tape got the tape I'm gonna

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
double sided tape got the tape I'm gonna
use<00:01:09.360> masking<00:01:09.810> tape<00:01:09.870> now<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.040> gonna<00:01:11.130> make

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
use masking tape now you're gonna make

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
use masking tape now you're gonna make
two<00:01:11.640> marks<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:12.300> each<00:01:12.900> into<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> board<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.710> at

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

one and seven-eighths and one at four
and<00:01:16.680> one-eighth<00:01:17.010> you'll<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.730> this<00:01:17.910> from<00:01:18.120> each

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and one-eighth you'll do this from each

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.180 
and one-eighth you'll do this from each
side<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> board<00:01:19.050> then<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.040> also

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
marking two lines on the outside now you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.840 
marking two lines on the outside now you
want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> measure<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.369> one-quarter

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
want to measure from one and one-quarter

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
want to measure from one and one-quarter
inches<00:01:30.270> across<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.440> get<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> Center<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.310> the

inches across to get the Center for the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
inches across to get the Center for the
holes<00:01:33.119> were<00:01:33.330> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.690> drill<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.290> help<00:01:34.470> us

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
holes were going to drill to help us

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.650 
holes were going to drill to help us
splitting<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.160> gonna<00:01:35.340> tape<00:01:35.700> masking<00:01:36.119> tape<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
splitting I'm gonna tape masking tape on

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.359 
splitting I'm gonna tape masking tape on
the<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.229> board<00:01:37.560> before<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.920> drill<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the back of this board before I drill it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.969 
the back of this board before I drill it
this<00:01:38.910> will<00:01:39.150> help<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> lip<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.619> keep<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
this will help with the lip to keep the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.320 
this will help with the lip to keep the
board<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.280> splitting<00:01:41.760> out<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.090> drill

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
board from splitting out when I drill

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.390 
board from splitting out when I drill
through<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.690> back<00:01:42.860> now<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
through the back now you will have to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.790 
through the back now you will have to
drill<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> hole<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.600> each<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:46.410> spots

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
drill a hole at each of the four spots

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:03.920 
drill a hole at each of the four spots
we<00:01:47.040> measured<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.640> centered<00:01:48.360> earlier<00:02:02.930> now

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
we measured and centered earlier now

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
we measured and centered earlier now
we'll<00:02:04.110> pull<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.410> tape<00:02:04.620> off<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> back<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.400> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
we'll pull the tape off the back and you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.690 
we'll pull the tape off the back and you
can<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.630> has<00:02:06.810> helped<00:02:07.110> protect<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
can see how it has helped protect the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
can see how it has helped protect the
board<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.119> splitting<00:02:09.510> quite<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.140> bad<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.350> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
board from splitting quite as bad as it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.420 
board from splitting quite as bad as it
normally<00:02:10.649> would<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:16.530> set<00:02:16.920> my<00:02:17.040> table<00:02:17.220> saw

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
normally would have now set my table saw

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.180 
normally would have now set my table saw
depth<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.540> 1/4<00:02:18.959> inches<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:20.070> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
depth to one and 1/4 inches and now I'm
