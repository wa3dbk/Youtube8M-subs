00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
going to go off the road I think if I

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.870 
going to go off the road I think if I
were<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.829> walk<00:01:33.070> Road<00:01:33.369> them<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:33.700> would<00:01:33.850> be

were to walk Road them I would be
horrified<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.479> would<00:01:34.780> never<00:01:34.960> drive<00:01:35.409> her<00:01:35.619> into

horrified I would never drive her into
place<00:01:35.979> again<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> faster<00:01:37.719> you<00:01:37.840> drive
