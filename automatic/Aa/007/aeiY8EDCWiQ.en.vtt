 very pretty in day though super sense 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.960
 weird because I started a day like that with 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 Sun then got a little 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.070

 you in this new video 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.520
 a human being 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.050
 it's super easy except to present only 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.760
 two ingredient 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.760
 and they can be like 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.200
 wants simply we're going to need 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 any type of yogurt with any 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.330
 kind of pasta follow the steps I'm going to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 say then gone to have a 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.739
 delicious thing and will not have anymore 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.739
 for you 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.720
 if you are interested continue different 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.200
 ingredients they use to make our 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.650
 make a strawberry yogurt and a banana or 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.630
 banana bananas banana I do not know how to 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.000
 they call it but in this case to use 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.400
 the technology with also use the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.220
 fruit evidence in the yogurt that you 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.680
 I really love 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's cut our little kidney in 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 slices 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.020
 and we're going to put it in these here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.940
 glass or if we're not going to put in a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.470
 thermal case I do not have a case 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.470
 useful thermal that extreme 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.030
 and in the next one they're going to have some 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.210
 this guy with the kids and they're not 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210
 completely 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.450
 and then we're going to put all our 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.460
 ingredients in a processor or if not 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.130
 in a blender like my place 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 well I'm going to use the processor 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.159
 process indicator is a good church 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.159
 in the list 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.700
 for the best I decided to make a cut 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 here for a lot more 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 as if everything big was going to be very 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 difficult to liquefy I decided to cut it 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.530
 as in small squares these 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
 things here I do not even know how transits for 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 make them much easier 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.810
 liquefy 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.020
 and in which our I go to this as 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.569
 everything as well as half cut so 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.230
 let's put next to ours 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.230
 with our banana 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.520
 and then let's put our 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.730
 processor or if not our blender 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 until when our ours is already 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.930
 water consistency 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.409
 and after about three 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.870
 minutes will be of that consistency and 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.640
 will be purito portals I'll see how 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.270
 they are what consistency more or less this 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.270
 look 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.970
 super we will want and delicious we will 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.970
 accommodate in a few glasses and we 're going to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.700
 put what we want to put more in two 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.800
 drams and we'll put up the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.800
 Things that the person likes best 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.780
 at the end to decorate it deduce some 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.580
 types of mediums 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.580
 and one hour 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.170
 and that's how our party is 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.380
 today I hope you liked the truth 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.870
 is that I am fascinated with 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.700
 it's super delicious and the people that 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.770
 they have like that the great blessing of 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.080
 live in countries that are very hot 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.970
 they 're going to love her, I'm not sure what 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.800
 they are going to love because I eat it 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 even when it's cold so to me 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.760
 love this type of ice cream and so 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.670
 the people who have the happiness of 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.070
 have that rich whole year will apply 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.350
 to want to eat this side 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.300
 and now that space came 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.100
 I like it more because it is the space 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.680
 as that interaction of knowing us 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.220
 more between us 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.380
 so the question of the day what is your 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.080
 preferred ice cream what is the book that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.240

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.800
 and about 4 days 14 years and I'm not 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.900
 addicted you have to start a little bit 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.790
 vary because they can not be eating 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.160
 always improved and then during 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.230
