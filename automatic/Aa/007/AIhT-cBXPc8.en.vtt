00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the manual I'm not sure what changed in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.820 
the manual I'm not sure what changed in
the<00:01:45.640> manual<00:01:46.060> but<00:01:46.119> they<00:01:46.869> had<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.110> update<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.650> but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
the manual but they had to update it but

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.960 
the manual but they had to update it but
it's<00:01:47.920> gonna<00:01:48.010> be<00:01:48.100> kind<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.340> funny<00:01:48.580> when<00:01:48.790> gosh

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
it's gonna be kind of funny when gosh

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.969 
it's gonna be kind of funny when gosh
you<00:01:49.150> see<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.420> manual<00:01:49.780> because<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.530> manual<00:01:50.890> is

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
you see the manual because the manual is

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.399 
you see the manual because the manual is
literally<00:01:51.460> only<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.909> few<00:01:52.119> pages<00:01:52.299> long<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.930> you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
literally only a few pages long and you

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.420 
literally only a few pages long and you
wouldn't<00:01:53.680> think<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> needs<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:54.189> many

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
wouldn't think it needs that many

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.609 
wouldn't think it needs that many
megabytes<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.420> show<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> few<00:01:55.869> pieces<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.229> pages

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
megabytes to show a few pieces of pages

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.679 
megabytes to show a few pieces of pages
but<00:01:56.650> I'm<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.820> telling<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.060> what<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> see

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
but I'm just telling you what I see

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.320 
but I'm just telling you what I see
so<00:01:59.470> go<00:01:59.860> ahead<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.280> install<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.790> well<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.210> is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
so go ahead and install as well this is

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.910 
so go ahead and install as well this is
a<00:02:01.360> full<00:02:01.689> time<00:02:01.930> right<00:02:02.140> here<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.439> installation

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
a full time right here the installation

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.039 
a full time right here the installation
process<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.360> installation<00:02:04.540> actually

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
process so the installation actually

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.899 
process so the installation actually
takes<00:02:05.229> longer<00:02:05.320> than<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.799> download<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.549> 17

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
takes longer than the download of the 17

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.710 
takes longer than the download of the 17
megabytes

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
megabytes

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.930 
megabytes
once<00:02:08.410> it's<00:02:08.560> done<00:02:08.649> installing<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.610> we'll<00:02:09.789> move

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
once it's done installing it we'll move

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.930 
once it's done installing it we'll move
ahead<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:11.170> basically<00:02:12.160> go<00:02:12.490> into<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> back

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
ahead to basically go into the back

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.730 
ahead to basically go into the back
screen<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.660> fast<00:02:13.900> forward<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:14.470> we

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
screen and I fast forward and here we

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.060 
screen and I fast forward and here we
are

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
are

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800 
are

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so you basically press X so you go

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.070 
so you basically press X so you go
through<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.080> manual<00:02:17.260> pretty<00:02:17.860> quickly

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
through the manual pretty quickly

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
through the manual pretty quickly

because it's over 30 megabytes just for
a<00:02:58.600> few<00:02:58.750> pages<00:02:59.080> not<00:02:59.920> too<00:03:00.160> sure<00:03:00.310> why<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.670> was

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
a few pages not too sure why that was

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.090 
a few pages not too sure why that was
but<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:01.450> what's<00:03:01.720> only<00:03:01.959> end<00:03:02.110> up<00:03:02.200> doing<00:03:02.440> but
