00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
got a Magna flow center section and then

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.609 
got a Magna flow center section and then
a<00:01:24.369> magnaflow<00:01:25.060> exhaust<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.899> exhaust<00:01:26.259> itself

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
a magnaflow exhaust the exhaust itself

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.739 
a magnaflow exhaust the exhaust itself
is<00:01:26.859> stainless<00:01:27.130> steel<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:28.149> center<00:01:28.450> section

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
is stainless steel the center section

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.660 
is stainless steel the center section
and<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.929> headers<00:01:29.229> have<00:01:29.380> been<00:01:29.590> ceramic<00:01:30.249> coated

and the headers have been ceramic coated

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.940 
and the headers have been ceramic coated
so<00:01:31.240> it's<00:01:31.389> going<00:01:31.539> to<00:01:31.600> keep<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.109> shine<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.679> it

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
so it's going to keep that shine on it

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.499 
so it's going to keep that shine on it

intake<00:01:38.079> on<00:01:38.319> it<00:01:38.499> and<00:01:39.310> we<00:01:39.490> put<00:01:39.639> on<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.909> dyno<00:01:40.149> for

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
intake on it and we put on the dyno for

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.980 
intake on it and we put on the dyno for
a<00:01:40.960> custom<00:01:41.710> predator<00:01:42.100> tune<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.090> things<00:01:43.569> set<00:01:43.840> up

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
a custom predator tune so things set up

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.719 
a custom predator tune so things set up
right<00:01:44.289> there's<00:01:44.710> absolutely<00:01:45.009> no<00:01:45.189> need<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.579> go

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
right there's absolutely no need to go

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.029 
right there's absolutely no need to go
waste<00:01:45.939> all<00:01:46.119> your<00:01:46.240> money<00:01:46.270> buy<00:01:46.630> an<00:01:46.780> SRT<00:01:47.259> eight

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
waste all your money buy an SRT eight

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.399 
waste all your money buy an SRT eight
I<00:01:48.100> mean<00:01:48.670> we're<00:01:49.119> matching<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.659> with<00:01:49.810> power<00:01:50.020> and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
I mean we're matching it with power and

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.989 
I mean we're matching it with power and
a<00:01:50.649> fraction<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.249> cost<00:01:51.459> those<00:01:51.700> things<00:01:51.880> are

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
a fraction of the cost those things are

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.270 
a fraction of the cost those things are
still<00:01:52.149> going<00:01:52.389> well<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.959> mid<00:01:53.139> 40s<00:01:53.469> you<00:01:54.249> know
