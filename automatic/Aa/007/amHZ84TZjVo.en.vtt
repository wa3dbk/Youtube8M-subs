a little fire lit up you know yeah I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.170 
a little fire lit up you know yeah I
think<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.310> fire<00:00:37.490> was<00:00:37.610> lit<00:00:37.640> when<00:00:37.940> he<00:00:38.000> was<00:00:38.150> uh

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
think the fire was lit when he was uh

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.760 
think the fire was lit when he was uh
you<00:00:38.600> know<00:00:38.960> in<00:00:39.250> bed<00:00:40.250> look<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.120> night<00:00:41.770> enough

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
you know in bed look that night enough

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.080 
you know in bed look that night enough
to<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.040> regained<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.610> floor<00:00:43.820> they<00:00:43.940> were

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
checking for triggers I think that would

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.200 
checking for triggers I think that would
fire<00:00:45.710> number<00:00:45.950> again<00:00:46.340> by<00:00:46.520> Sheamus
