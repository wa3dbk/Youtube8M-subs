00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and in fact they're just the just use a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.350 
and in fact they're just the just use a
regular<00:01:06.420> watch<00:01:07.290> band<00:01:07.590> spring<00:01:07.830> bar<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.240> in

because it won't even fit in there even

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
because it won't even fit in there even
if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> could<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.869> manhandle<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:12.990> into
