00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 every morning it's the same challenge 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.240
 bring in almost 35 kg of business 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.670
 in these tiny bags the strict 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 minimum to survive two weeks in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.180
 holidays must not forget our business 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 of which it was soon enough 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.640
 that she is no longer wearing anything so there we 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 all have a pact and it takes water for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 drinking are often quite thirsty the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 food in general we stop in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 way to make a vital interest at 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 the christ family the holidays have been 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 always conjugated with lots and this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.320
 year again this Swiss couple does not have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 derogated from the rule even if the little cleo 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.020
 14 months was invited to the trip 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 [Music] 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.280
 basel departed for dole in 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.650
 the jura with a stopover at mulhouse 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 a route between countryside and city 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.120
 which suits them rather well 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.290
 the city is already so we like 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.960
 the city here we can do a little 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.670
 break in a cafe eat something 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.100
 that we do it very willingly 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.410
 if they chose the bike it's good for 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.350
 to be closer to nature 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.690
 to discover landscapes at the rhythm 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.690
 a pedal stroke at the time it is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.829
 it also allows you to see the world 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.229
 stop very quickly 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.350
 in fact we feel free they have without 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.939
 lips that pass when we roll to the east 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.799
 adventure side is also important there one 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.610
 really moves day-to-day and 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.060
 then we have a vague idea of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 goal 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 the day but we let ourselves be surprised 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.579
 by the dials by the turquoise front 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.649
 adventurer in the soul our cyclists the 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.560
 thailand Morocco or the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.959
 california they did everything by bike and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.179
 this year Alsace and Frank County 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.630
 less exotic but more comfortable 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:07.479
 for miss a trip from where for 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:10.420
 this first adventure to 3 for 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.700
 the moment very well they love to be 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.640
 his expectation then ran against 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.200
 against the aunt then she is always 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.060
 out so I think it's great for 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.739
 it's just that we have to adapt 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 a little bit the steps have done a little less 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.550
 kilometers 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.130
 yes c 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.080
 photo nor account then probably cleo ne 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.090
 will not remember this trip but 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.160
 maybe he 'll wake up at home 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.340
 vocation is what is lost 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.730
 parents traveling the world with family has 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 bicycle
