game laws by baiting deer but this is
very<00:00:41.989> early<00:00:42.229> it's<00:00:42.620> good<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.519> get<00:00:43.639> your

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
very early it's good to get your

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.319 
very early it's good to get your
minerals<00:00:44.210> out<00:00:44.620> for<00:00:45.620> two<00:00:45.769> reasons<00:00:46.280> one<00:00:46.370> for<00:00:47.149> the

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
minerals out for two reasons one for the

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.520 
minerals out for two reasons one for the
for<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.109> doe<00:00:48.319> lactating<00:00:49.159> doe<00:00:49.339> to<00:00:49.399> pass<00:00:49.819> those

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
for the doe lactating doe to pass those

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.559 
for the doe lactating doe to pass those
minerals<00:00:51.530> on<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.280> fawns<00:00:52.549> so<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.329> fawns

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
minerals on to the fawns so the fawns

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.779 
minerals on to the fawns so the fawns
are<00:00:53.749> a<00:00:53.809> little<00:00:53.899> bit<00:00:54.079> stronger<00:00:54.469> able<00:00:54.889> to<00:00:55.069> grow<00:00:55.760> a

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
are a little bit stronger able to grow a

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.139 
are a little bit stronger able to grow a
little<00:00:55.969> bit<00:00:56.120> bigger<00:00:56.209> and<00:00:56.749> then<00:00:57.589> we'll<00:00:58.149> Willa's

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
little bit bigger and then we'll Willa's

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.189 
little bit bigger and then we'll Willa's
helps<00:00:59.479> the<00:00:59.839> Bucks<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.589> baby<00:01:01.489> get<00:01:01.879> another

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
helps the Bucks and baby get another

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.049 
helps the Bucks and baby get another
little<00:01:03.199> bit<00:01:03.319> of<00:01:03.530> antler<00:01:04.129> growth<00:01:04.159> out<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
little bit of antler growth out of the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.870 
little bit of antler growth out of the
box<00:01:05.650> that's<00:01:06.650> debatable<00:01:06.980> from<00:01:07.430> what<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:07.610> read

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
box that's debatable from what I read

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.440 
box that's debatable from what I read
whether<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:08.390> actually<00:01:08.900> works<00:01:09.140> or<00:01:09.290> not<00:01:09.350> that

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
whether it actually works or not that

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.840 
whether it actually works or not that
remains<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.630> be<00:01:11.660> seen<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:12.520> now<00:01:13.520> when<00:01:13.730> you're

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
remains to be seen but now when you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.610 
remains to be seen but now when you're
hunting<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.570> always<00:01:14.930> want<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> little<00:01:15.440> bit<00:01:15.560> of

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
an edge you want to do something is not

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700 
an edge you want to do something is not
very<00:01:18.530> expensive<00:01:19.340> these<00:01:19.610> were<00:01:19.880> about<00:01:20.710> 15

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
very expensive these were about 15

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.300 
very expensive these were about 15
dollars<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.250> bags<00:01:22.490> for<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.510> pre-made<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.500> did

can<00:01:35.210> buy<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:37.670> didn't<00:01:38.180> have<00:01:38.330> our<00:01:38.540> vehicle

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
can buy but we didn't have our vehicle

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.510 
can buy but we didn't have our vehicle
to<00:01:39.200> haul<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.530> stuff<00:01:39.590> down<00:01:39.950> here<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.370> make

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
to haul the stuff down here to make

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.040 
to haul the stuff down here to make
everything<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.120> time<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.870> a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
everything this time and this is a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.560 
everything this time and this is a
little<00:01:42.500> bit<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.770> downhill<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:44.390> haul

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
little bit of a downhill so just haul

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.690 
little bit of a downhill so just haul
the<00:01:44.720> 50<00:01:45.050> pounds<00:01:45.440> down<00:01:45.620> instead<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.250> about<00:01:46.490> two

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
the 50 pounds down instead of about two

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.730 
the 50 pounds down instead of about two
hundred<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:47.000> fifty<00:01:47.150> pounds<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.590> went

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
hundred and fifty pounds so we just went

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.130 
hundred and fifty pounds so we just went
with<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.060> pre-made<00:01:50.060> sportsmen<00:01:50.840> choice

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
with the pre-made sportsmen choice

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.980 
with the pre-made sportsmen choice
record<00:01:51.620> rack<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.250> again<00:01:53.090> mineral<00:01:53.510> deer<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
record rack and again mineral deer and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.280 
record rack and again mineral deer and
elk<00:01:54.050> fee<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:54.800> basically<00:01:55.659> salt<00:01:56.659> mineral

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
elk fee but it's basically salt mineral

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
elk fee but it's basically salt mineral
and<00:01:57.770> for<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.070> bones<00:01:58.310> and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and for the bones and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
and for the bones and
basic<00:02:01.170> overall<00:02:01.829> health<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.369> mean<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.729> even

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
basic overall health I mean it's even

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.929 
basic overall health I mean it's even
has<00:02:03.149> vitamins<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.399> I'll<00:02:05.399> probably<00:02:05.640> put

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
has vitamins in it so I'll probably put

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.199 
has vitamins in it so I'll probably put
a<00:02:06.000> link<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.209> see

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
area right here this is a little bit of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
area right here this is a little bit of
a<00:02:16.230> natural<00:02:16.410> pit<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.550> we're<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.510> gonna

actually fill it in a little bit but dig
out<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.840> sides<00:02:22.519> spread<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.640> mineral<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.209> so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
out the sides spread the mineral in so

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.150 
out the sides spread the mineral in so
the<00:02:25.290> first<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.650> we're<00:02:25.769> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> go<00:02:26.069> ahead

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the old leaves cleared out and then dig

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.820 
the old leaves cleared out and then dig
up<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> ground<00:02:32.370> 3/4<00:02:33.090> inches<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.600> so

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
and again you see it's a little bit of a

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.710 
and again you see it's a little bit of a
hill<00:05:11.340> going<00:05:12.340> down<00:05:12.669> but<00:05:12.940> we<00:05:13.030> left<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.479> high

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
hill going down but we left it high

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.800 
hill going down but we left it high
enough<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.849> it's<00:05:15.849> not<00:05:15.910> going<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.330> flow<00:05:16.570> over

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
enough that it's not going to flow over

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.150 
enough that it's not going to flow over
the<00:05:17.050> side<00:05:17.289> and<00:05:17.320> we're<00:05:17.680> gonna<00:05:17.740> lose<00:05:17.979> our
