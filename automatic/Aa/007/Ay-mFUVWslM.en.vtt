 greatly restore your strength because 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.000
 that this is just the way you will 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.890
 allow yourself to enter a spontaneous trance 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.079
 during which you will recover 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.600
 your strength and the fact that you could normally 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.450
 need to work every two to three hours 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.789
 allow yourself to do such a minute on 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 15-20 break so your brains have time 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.299

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.929
