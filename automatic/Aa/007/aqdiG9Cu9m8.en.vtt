in<00:01:06.659> their<00:01:06.810> seat<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.290> they're<00:01:07.530> standing

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in their seat you know they're standing

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.539 
in their seat you know they're standing
and<00:01:08.280> slacking<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.680> they<00:01:10.680> don't<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and slacking and they don't have the

and slacking and they don't have the
seats<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> protect<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:15.049> it's<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
seats to protect them and so it's a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.460 
seats to protect them and so it's a
serious<00:01:16.590> injury<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.049> serious

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
serious injury in and it's a serious

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
serious injury in and it's a serious
accident<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.369> accidents<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.330> there
