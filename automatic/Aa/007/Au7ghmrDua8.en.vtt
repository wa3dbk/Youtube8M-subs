00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello people welcome once more alone 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.579
 for all of us today we will be teaching 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.259
 a very, very easy way to 

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.540
 cut glass bottles but as well as 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.250
 easy is also dangerous so take 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.629
 the necessary precautions and now 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 you will be asking why 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.039
 we want to cut glass bottles 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.539
 well in this video we're just going to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.220
 be teaching the way to do it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.810
 but prepare yourself because one of the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 next videos we will be doing 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 something very interesting with which we are going to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 need this technique so hands 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.419
 to the work we will need it is thread 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 of cotton the best thread is 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.140
 cotton does not matter if the thickness is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.350
 fine if it's too thin they give it more laps 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.750
 we're going to need 95 96 % alcohol 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 ethyl alcohol we will be using a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 container with water where we can 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 put the whole bottle and we're going to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 be it sanz also a little protection 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.310
 and obviously fire to start we're going to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 take the thread and we will give you about 3 o 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.920
 4 returns to the bottle this is going to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.929
 have to be well adjusted 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.179
 now let's take the alcohol we're going 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.519
 to wet well all the thread so that it is 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.469
 well wet with alcohol let's have 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.909
 to fill the bottle with water until the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.790
 Thread height this will not work 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.560
 also to put the right thread as 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 we're going to have to light it on fire 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.240
 thread what we are going to do is first 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 Keep alcohol away as much as possible 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.080
 second we are going to do is prepare the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.390
 water leave the list about the bottle 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.939
 and finally we're going to set fire to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.780
 cord and now we have to move away 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.780
 caution 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 i 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.160
 and once it's turned off now yes 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.160
 we're going to submerge it in the cold water 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.830
 and this one would be consulted from our glass 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.620
 made with a glass bottle but 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.780
 as the edges are still very 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.430
 sharp and are like uneven for 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.500
 to be able to use the glasses first we are going to 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.619
 have to sand and ideally to do it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 It is a wood sandpaper of 100 or 150 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.520
 Y 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.950
 or not 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.990
 and now you will be asking about 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.120
 what happens 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
 well the explanation of this is not very 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.210
 difficult to understand has a lot of relationship 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 with what we did with the anti- balloon 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.290
 flames with the anti-flames bill as well 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.580
 that now I'm going to give you some advice what 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.500
 what happens is that when we 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.350
 we put the string around the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.240
 bottle and we set it on fire the heat what 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.950
 what it does is dilate the objects what 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.050
 happens is that it begins to dilate the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.820
 bottle begins to enlarge and when 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.310
 we give you that abrupt change of 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.500
 temperature the bottle shrinks so 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.090
 quickly it ends up breaking and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.520
 what is happening here is just 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 as we put water to the part 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.960
 below remember what we see in others 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.970
 experiments the water absorbs the energy 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.610
 thermal does not allow the lower part to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.440
 hot as much as the top 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.960
 this also facilitates that the line 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.810
 be more even and do not cut all 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.360
 uneven another important thing too 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.060
 is that if suddenly does not leave him 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.520
 first time because suddenly not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.770
 they put a lot of alcohol in the thread or thread 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.090
 it was very little then what is going to 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.100
 happen is that when you mix it in the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.350
 water does not break 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.240
 big mistake if you put him back 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.030
 alcohol to that thread that is wet and 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.220
 then they set it on fire because 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 remember what happened on the anti- banknote 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.930
 flames we mix alcohol with 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.700
 water what happened was that the water 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.230
 absorbed all the thermal energy of 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
 alcohol and did not let the ticket 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.960
 burn if we here do the same 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.970
 we put alcohol in the thread that is already 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.560
 wet then what is going to happen is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.420
 that the water that is also in the thread 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.190
 will absorb the heat and the bottle will not 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.690
 is going to heat then what has 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.070
 what to do in the case that has not 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.710
 worked out that in everything again 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.960
 put a new thread on fire now 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.340
 yes with alcohol try again 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.320
 with a little more thread or with a little 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.650
 more of alcohol and if you create more video like 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.980
 you can go to one's page 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.980
 for all 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.949
 I want to take advantage now also for 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.709
 explain that this video we recorded some 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.109
 3 or 4 times because he was not giving the 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.860
 result that we expected for example 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.840
 putting two twists of threads and not 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.789
 it putting water what happened was that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 It was very uneven but it was very 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.860
 uneven you see that it ends all as 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.169
 cracking all the glass and not us 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.850
 I was going to serve as glasses after mushrooms 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.270
 for example I put it a lot more 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.699
 thread since the last one is here and 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.449
 notice that even everything was broken 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.070
 down here and in this case it broke down not 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.630
 just because we did not put water on it but 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.419
 because we wanted to leave 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.370
 supported here because we want to make it 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.810
 a safe way because as 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.160
 Holding it with your hand is like a 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.479
 little more dangerous then we are 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.610
 trying to look for ways that are 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.229
 safe for you guys that 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.680
 surely they will want to imitate this in 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.440
 home and nothing bad happens to them then what 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.120
 it is better to put water on it in case 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.830
 she does not want herself because she has to have 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 very hot to break alone 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.960
 Then put water 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.420
 and set it on fire when the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.710
 fire resin make it on and after 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.420
 that has been played on fire they take it 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.890
 obviously with gloves and immerse them in 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.410
 water and there you will see that the cut is 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.560
 produces fairly evenly there is no 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.240
 perfect but it's pretty even like that 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.950
 be very careful because it is a 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.290
 experience an experiment that is 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.030
 really dangerous if you do not take care 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.650
 hands what happened there is jumping a video 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.020
 everywhere, so that has been 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.280
 everything we see in the next video already 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.790
 are going to see what are we going to do with these 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.090
 regards 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.090
 bye
