00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.030
 Brazil that you are affecting me here in the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.150
 truth is more or less so the beginning 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.150
 of the wall there is the Russian mobilization 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.050
 of the Brazilian crowd in the pitch and such 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.120
 going to the game and then the fans and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.870
 the entire length of the wall. 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 huh 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.580
 and then going over the history of the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.820
 telling the whole story of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.240
 some Brazilian cities until 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.240
 at the stadium 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.380
 What do you set fire to your work? 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.720
 here on this wall that will transform 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.850
 in a tourist point of são paulo 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.010
 the controversy that this first place that 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.660
 I live in the East zone, not personally from here. 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.360
 since i was born 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.370
 It's a wall of the train line so it's a 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.190
 something that symbolic in graphite it 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.040
 We always want to paint. 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.819
 those who have also been 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.819
 very rewarding 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.480
 for glory and four miles of wall 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.330
 It takes a lot of ink to make this 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.580
 work will be used 7 thousand sprays and 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.580
 more than 10,000 liters of latex paint 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.810
 being this great wall in the east is 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 a region little visited by tourists 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.230
 you believe that only will make the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.370
 people come here and meet 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.320
 To visit for sure, we have the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.300
 to a bicycle path, then the person 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.760

 I think the city had a little 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.010
 stop painting the walls of 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.870
 gray and leave a little more colorful 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.870
 sao paulo breathes forward 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.290
