00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.490
 our pursuit of fun there 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.499
 leads to naples by the angels of love for 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.410
 the return of danny danny tenaglia 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.889
 to support him in the sasha carassi console 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.990
 but he always wants a great emotion 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.260
 a very strong anxiety when I'm in front 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 to my audience it's really a thing 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 incredible because they transmit a heat 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 and an absurd energy therefore that something 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 it's nicer to play at home 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.880
 own to be acclaimed by one's own 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.880
 villagers really a great emotion 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.219
 tonight your presence on the console 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.969
 was expressly requested by danny 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.950
 pincer which effect makes you of this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.530
 I'm 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.630
 really absolutely like saying 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 enthusiastic and even embarrassed uncertain 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.160
 ass because anyway it was always the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.670
 my myth one of the least of the 90s 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.580
 when i started doing dj around 18 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.500
 20 years ago it was one of mine 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.460
 inspirational and now be called right 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.140
 from him and for me something that puts me 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.270
 great joy even embarrassment from the object 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.420
 like because I do n't know what to do 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.660
 how to reciprocate a gesture so that I say 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.660
 just thanks 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.050
 and the first time you participate in a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 party around glock 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.850
 what do you think I am very honored of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.590
 this that this thing does not do much 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.520
 pleasure that insinuates maurizia have 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.399
 chosen me to participate in this 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.080
 this wonderful event I don't know what else 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.570
 really say 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.970
 I am honored I am very pleased I hope 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.340
 that there will be other opportunities for 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.420
 working together I 'm really happy 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.290
 of this collaboration 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.290
 they are very good 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.489
 how was your approach with danny 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.849
 Tenaglia he wrote to me one day 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.890
 facebook saying hi i'm leaving a lot 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.780
 in quotation marks your fan I follow I follow you 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 much like the two productions the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.579
 I am very much then I like the fact 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.019
 that you are Neapolitan 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.470
 you have something extra because I love 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.230
 in short, then I said but since then 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.150
 but really you are but you are not there 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.389
 I believed in the beginning that it was really him 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 then starting to change for the better 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.870
 etc. etc. phone numbers 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.430
 exte hair 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.450
 we started talking he got me 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.970
 invited to the winter music conference 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.220
 last year he played with them is 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.109
 it was a beautiful experience then i am 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.050
 returned to face of new york 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.710
 we have done 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.580
 a nice tour for new york made me 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.080
 see his his world one thing 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.080
 really that I did n't expect 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.190
 Naples is a city that very often 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.940
 produces digital including as there is 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.000
 explain I do not know will be the air will be the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.160
 I don't know mozzarella alla tarantella 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.890
 the blood is very blood like 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.790
 population so I think it's a fact 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.220
 innate in music as in art 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.540
 we have an extra gear and this 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.900
 really recognized at the level 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.510
 world today so that's fine with me 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.840
 the fact of having a dowry we have and the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.840
 exploit 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.440
 but you too, like others of a geso due 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.230
 go abroad 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.750
 let's say that 95 percent of mine 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.270
 evenings are married abroad for a 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.630
 request agreement I don't know precisely 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.450
 the reason however we say that the north 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.220
 europe and mine is my destination more 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.710
 gettonata so it's what you do 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.440
 from germany the holland to the various peer in 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.720
 belgium switzerland etc. and so on 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.420
 still little but we are there 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.420
 working we hope to succeed 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.710
 who delivers from the young DJs they want 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.360
 emerge but fail to carry the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.500
 their music outside the four 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.630
 house walls 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.520
 try to be humble don't try to 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.890
 going to step short chase 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.170
 have the steps that are natural in the 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.520
 life do not try to break through immediately 17 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:07.940
 years trying to flaunt flaunt toma 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.370
 always things must be lived the mess 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.670
 it must be done in a certain sense I have it 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.280
 made so much that is a council that 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.280
 return you don't want to want everything 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.520
 immediately try to have a moment of 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.640
 knowledge of the roofs as it does a 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.420
 apprenticeship to begin to enter a 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.570
 mechanism is not simple but it can be done 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.570
 to success 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.139
 nowadays it is necessary to have a woman 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.380
 ball need to have a must if you know it 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.720
 do because I know so many people that 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.990
 they don't have it but they don't know how to do it either 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.500
 they hurt it or there is no time 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.100
 quite right 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.080
 I believe that doing this job this 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.010
 it's a trade so doing it means 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.300
 do it 24 hours a day not to waste time 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.090
 as a hobby 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:13.060
 if you want to do it do it with 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.530
 with the always with the conscience that it 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.720
 make it become a real one 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.199
 I work not for obi not for fun because 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.630
 so 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.520
 take away the people you really have 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.520
 they work there and live on these things 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.509
 thanks sasha and the next su enjoy 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.830
