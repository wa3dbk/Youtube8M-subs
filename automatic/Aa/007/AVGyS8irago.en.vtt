so<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.870> test<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.560> would<00:00:01.680> be<00:00:01.829> able

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so is this a test that you would be able

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.480 
so is this a test that you would be able
to<00:00:02.129> do<00:00:03.799> preventively<00:00:04.799> which<00:00:05.160> means<00:00:05.370> like

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to do preventively which means like

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.010 
to do preventively which means like
before<00:00:05.730> if<00:00:05.850> you<00:00:06.000> had<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> young<00:00:06.420> puppy<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:06.899> you

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
before if you had a young puppy that you

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.360 
before if you had a young puppy that you
were<00:00:07.109> interested<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.710> finding<00:00:08.099> out<00:00:08.250> or

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
were interested in just finding out or

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.620 
were interested in just finding out or
does<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> animal<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.120> be<00:00:09.210> exposed<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
does the animal have to be exposed to

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.589 
does the animal have to be exposed to
the<00:00:09.780> allergen<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> able<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:11.389> test<00:00:12.389> positive

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the allergen to be able to test positive

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.410 
the allergen to be able to test positive
oh<00:00:13.259> your<00:00:13.769> question<00:00:14.160> sir<00:00:14.400> yeah<00:00:14.790> sorry<00:00:15.240> your

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
oh your question sir yeah sorry your

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.490 
oh your question sir yeah sorry your
questions<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.900> perfect<00:00:16.289> actually<00:00:17.070> most<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
questions are perfect actually most so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
questions are perfect actually most so
its<00:00:22.710> frequent<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> ongoing<00:00:23.699> exposure<00:00:24.570> so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
its frequent and ongoing exposure so

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
its frequent and ongoing exposure so
testing<00:00:25.410> puppies<00:00:25.800> doesn't<00:00:26.160> make<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.490> sense

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
testing puppies doesn't make much sense

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
testing puppies doesn't make much sense
but<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.930> should<00:00:28.109> start<00:00:28.349> testing<00:00:28.830> them

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
but I think we should start testing them

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009 
but I think we should start testing them
a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.519> after<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> year<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> age<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> year

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
a little after a year of age like a year

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
a little after a year of age like a year
and<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> half<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.650> certainly<00:00:32.040> maybe<00:00:32.730> once<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and a half and certainly maybe once a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
and a half and certainly maybe once a
year<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.630> need<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> preventative<00:00:34.770> ly

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
year we need to do it preventative ly

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
year we need to do it preventative ly
because<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:37.020> human<00:00:37.350> studies

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because we know now from human studies

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.580 
because we know now from human studies
that<00:00:38.100> 3<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> 5<00:00:38.969> months<00:00:39.420> before<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that 3 to 5 months before your

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
that 3 to 5 months before your
gastrointestinal<00:00:41.250> tract<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.940> affected<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gastrointestinal tract is affected the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290 
gastrointestinal tract is affected the
antibodies<00:00:43.530> appear<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.100> saliva<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
antibodies appear in your saliva so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.029 
antibodies appear in your saliva so
basically<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.899> part<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> whole<00:00:46.680> wellness

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
basically it's part of a whole wellness

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
basically it's part of a whole wellness
package<00:00:47.700> isn't<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
package isn't it to do that and it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740 
package isn't it to do that and it's
easy<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.860> saliva<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.600> something

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
easy to do on saliva so it's something

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740 
easy to do on saliva so it's something
that<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.219> adult<00:00:54.149> preventive

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that you would do as as adult preventive

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
that you would do as as adult preventive
maintenance<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.500> something<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.010> would

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
maintenance but not something you would

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
maintenance but not something you would
do<00:00:56.280> let's<00:00:56.520> say<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.879> younger<00:00:57.090> animals<00:00:57.660> for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
do let's say for younger animals for

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
do let's say for younger animals for
adult<00:00:58.469> dogs<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.070> already<00:00:59.250> exhibiting

adult dogs that are already exhibiting

adult dogs that are already exhibiting
symptoms<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.170> testing<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
symptoms and you do testing then that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680 
symptoms and you do testing then that
really<00:01:02.609> doesn't<00:01:02.820> provide<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> list

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
really doesn't provide you like a list

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
really doesn't provide you like a list
of<00:01:03.809> foods<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.439> would<00:01:04.650> avoid<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.519> help

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of foods that you would avoid to help

to me about why this saliva testing is

to me about why this saliva testing is

immunological problem necessarily it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.600 
immunological problem necessarily it
just<00:03:30.020> means<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.620> food<00:03:30.860> interacts

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
just means that the food interacts

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.670 
just means that the food interacts
somehow<00:03:32.000> with<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.540> gastrointestinal<00:03:33.020> tract

somehow with the gastrointestinal tract
and<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:35.000> can't<00:03:35.239> tolerate<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
and it you can't tolerate it so it's a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.810 
and it you can't tolerate it so it's a
slightly<00:03:36.650> different<00:03:36.800> situation<00:03:37.220> but<00:03:37.700> it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
slightly different situation but it

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.600 
slightly different situation but it
means<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.090> should<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:40.070> salivary

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
means you should have that and salivary

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.610 
means you should have that and salivary

just because it's excellent nutrition

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.700 
just because it's excellent nutrition
doesn't<00:04:47.180> mean<00:04:47.360> it's<00:04:47.690> really<00:04:47.960> biologically

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
doesn't mean it's really biologically

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.559 
doesn't mean it's really biologically
appropriate<00:04:49.159> for<00:04:49.340> your<00:04:49.550> individual<00:04:50.090> animals

really exciting along with that talk to

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.640 
really exciting along with that talk to
me<00:05:04.969> a<00:05:05.000> little<00:05:05.270> bit<00:05:05.419> about<00:05:05.659> some<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.199> immune

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
me a little bit about some of the immune

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.170 
me a little bit about some of the immune
testing<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.490> something<00:05:07.759> you<00:05:07.879> would<00:05:08.000> do

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
testing is that something you would do

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.820 
testing is that something you would do
let's<00:05:08.419> say<00:05:08.569> at<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.810> same<00:05:09.020> time<00:05:09.289> is<00:05:09.590> is

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
let's say at the same time is is

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.390 
let's say at the same time is is
checking<00:05:10.400> IGI<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.240> IgM<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.349> IgG<00:05:12.590> levels<00:05:12.949> how

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
checking IGI a IgM and IgG levels how

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.420 
checking IGI a IgM and IgG levels how
would<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:13.759> correlate<00:05:14.300> with<00:05:14.330> with<00:05:15.430> checking

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
would that correlate with with checking

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.879 
would that correlate with with checking
the<00:05:16.580> patient's<00:05:16.940> immune<00:05:17.060> status<00:05:17.680> okay<00:05:18.680> that's

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
the patient's immune status okay that's

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.379 
the patient's immune status okay that's
a<00:05:18.979> slightly<00:05:19.219> different<00:05:19.370> thing<00:05:19.699> in<00:05:19.969> that<00:05:20.120> case

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
a slightly different thing in that case

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.230 
a slightly different thing in that case
we<00:05:20.659> serum<00:05:21.469> from<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.979> animal<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.759> we<00:05:22.940> check

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
we serum from the animal and we check

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.659 
we serum from the animal and we check
the<00:05:23.569> amount<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.289> globulin<00:05:24.889> generically

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
the amount of globulin generically

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.520 
the amount of globulin generically
present<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.419> just<00:05:26.690> against<00:05:27.080> foods<00:05:27.289> but

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
present not just against foods but

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.409 
present not just against foods but
anything<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.219> so<00:05:28.669> animals<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.300> are

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
anything and so animals that are

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.510 
anything and so animals that are
deficient<00:05:29.719> in<00:05:30.050> one<00:05:30.080> or<00:05:30.469> more<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.740> these<00:05:31.039> for

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
and that's one of the tests that I also

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.680 
and that's one of the tests that I also
submit<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:07.310> Hima<00:06:07.580> pet<00:06:07.819> and<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:08.389> I<00:06:08.479> really

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
submit to Hima pet and and I really

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
submit to Hima pet and and I really
appreciate<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:10.669> the<00:06:11.449> interpretive<00:06:12.199> comments

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
appreciate the the interpretive comments

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.320 
appreciate the the interpretive comments
because<00:06:13.039> there<00:06:13.219> are<00:06:13.279> a<00:06:13.310> lot<00:06:13.430> of<00:06:13.460> animals<00:06:13.940> that

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
because there are a lot of animals that

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.050 
because there are a lot of animals that
are<00:06:15.319> genetically<00:06:15.919> predisposed<00:06:16.550> to<00:06:16.849> not

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
are genetically predisposed to not

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.089 
are genetically predisposed to not
having<00:06:17.330> healthy<00:06:18.139> balanced<00:06:18.409> immune<00:06:18.710> systems

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
having healthy balanced immune systems

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.320 
having healthy balanced immune systems
and<00:06:19.219> it<00:06:19.370> can<00:06:19.490> be<00:06:19.550> frustrating<00:06:19.729> as<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.090> pet<00:06:20.300> owner

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
and it can be frustrating as a pet owner

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.629 
and it can be frustrating as a pet owner
to<00:06:20.930> be<00:06:21.020> working<00:06:21.409> in<00:06:21.529> and<00:06:21.800> really<00:06:22.370> doing

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
to be working in and really doing

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.589 
to be working in and really doing
everything<00:06:22.849> you<00:06:23.060> feel<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.449> possibly

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
everything you feel that you possibly

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.420 
everything you feel that you possibly
can<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.169> still<00:06:24.289> have<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.469> pet<00:06:24.710> that's<00:06:24.860> unwell

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
can and still have a pet that's unwell

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.510 
can and still have a pet that's unwell
and<00:06:25.789> so<00:06:26.330> that's<00:06:26.930> a<00:06:27.080> test<00:06:27.349> that<00:06:27.469> chemo<00:06:28.039> pet<00:06:28.219> also

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
and so that's a test that chemo pet also

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.860 
and so that's a test that chemo pet also
offers<00:06:28.849> that<00:06:29.000> I<00:06:29.029> think<00:06:29.270> is<00:06:29.360> can<00:06:29.539> be<00:06:29.629> really

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
offers that I think is can be really

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.809 
offers that I think is can be really
