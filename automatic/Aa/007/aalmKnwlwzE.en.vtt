day one was a 250 call of a city loop
day<00:00:49.289> 2<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.829> took<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> car<00:00:50.489> sir<00:00:50.670> eastern<00:00:51.000> creek

day 2 we took the car sir eastern creek
so<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:53.010> test<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> cars<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> track<00:00:53.969> well

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.350 
different we measured all cars by
filling<00:02:17.250> them<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> point<00:02:17.850> where<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
filling them to the point where you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.880 
filling them to the point where you
could<00:02:18.480> actually<00:02:18.630> see<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.260> fuel<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
could actually see the fuel in the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.340 
could actually see the fuel in the
filler<00:02:20.100> neck<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:21.150> avoided<00:02:21.750> issues<00:02:22.140> with

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
filler neck this avoided issues with

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.540 
filler neck this avoided issues with
different<00:02:22.680> pumps<00:02:22.980> clicking<00:02:23.310> off<00:02:23.430> at

differently test so to account for
different<00:02:37.080> driving<00:02:37.320> styles<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:38.190> divided<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
different driving styles we divided the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
different driving styles we divided the
route<00:02:38.940> into<00:02:39.150> seven<00:02:39.660> sections<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.560> every

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
route into seven sections so that every

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.040 
route into seven sections so that every

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
better mix of driving sales there was

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.730 
better mix of driving sales there was
just<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:45.959> rule<00:02:46.230> drive<00:02:46.980> each<00:02:47.220> car<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.850> same

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
just one rule drive each car the same

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
just one rule drive each car the same
all<00:02:49.740> cars<00:02:50.130> were<00:02:50.220> turned<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.940> same<00:02:51.120> time

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
kilometers of driving around town all

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.650 
kilometers of driving around town all
cars<00:02:59.400> were<00:02:59.489> refilled<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> figures

recorder to find out how they all

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.520 
recorder to find out how they all
compared<00:03:03.560> make<00:03:04.560> sense

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
compared make sense

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.000

again<00:03:06.360> they<00:03:07.360> too<00:03:07.420> saw<00:03:08.050> an<00:03:08.170> early<00:03:08.530> start<00:03:08.800> that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
again they too saw an early start that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.290 
again they too saw an early start that
is<00:03:09.100> some<00:03:09.310> creek<00:03:09.520> raceway<00:03:11.580> all<00:03:12.580> cars<00:03:12.880> will<00:03:13.090> test

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
is some creek raceway all cars will test

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.430 
is some creek raceway all cars will test
it<00:03:13.420> up<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.720> down<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.959> scope<00:03:14.170> the

it up and down the scope the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.650 
it up and down the scope the
acceleration<00:03:15.130> both<00:03:15.580> India<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.090> from<00:03:16.569> a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
acceleration both India and from a

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.860 
acceleration both India and from a
standing<00:03:16.990> start<00:03:17.050> as<00:03:17.470> well<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:18.040> breaking<00:03:18.870> so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
standing start as well as breaking so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.229 
standing start as well as breaking so
here<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.200> are<00:03:20.319> day<00:03:20.740> two<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:21.310> our<00:03:21.490> alternative

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
here we are day two of our alternative

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.410 
here we are day two of our alternative
fuels<00:03:22.540> mega<00:03:23.080> test<00:03:23.380> bright<00:03:24.370> sunny<00:03:24.610> day<00:03:24.850> maybe

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
fuels mega test bright sunny day maybe

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.229 
fuels mega test bright sunny day maybe
not<00:03:25.630> at<00:03:25.780> eastern<00:03:26.110> creek<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:27.180> we're<00:03:28.180> actually

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
not at eastern creek and we're actually

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.120 
not at eastern creek and we're actually
here<00:03:28.569> now<00:03:28.630> doing<00:03:29.050> our<00:03:29.260> performance<00:03:29.739> testing

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
here now doing our performance testing

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.940 
here now doing our performance testing
so<00:03:30.550> that's<00:03:30.730> quarter<00:03:31.239> mile<00:03:31.420> runs<00:03:31.989> braking

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
so that's quarter mile runs braking

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.010 
so that's quarter mile runs braking
acceleration<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:34.030> gear<00:03:34.180> acceleration<00:03:34.750> all

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
acceleration in gear acceleration all

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.170 
acceleration in gear acceleration all
the<00:03:35.230> nuts<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.560> bolts<00:03:35.770> after<00:03:36.550> busy<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
the nuts and bolts after busy and

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.979 
the nuts and bolts after busy and
grueling<00:03:37.620> 250k<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.680> around<00:03:39.070> town<00:03:39.370> yesterday

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
grueling 250k is around town yesterday

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.150 
grueling 250k is around town yesterday
so<00:03:40.989> joining<00:03:41.260> why<00:03:41.500> we<00:03:41.709> assembled<00:03:42.070> this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
so joining why we assembled this

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.000 
so joining why we assembled this
collection<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.519> cars<00:03:42.700> basically<00:03:44.010> alternative

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
collection of cars basically alternative

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.890 
collection of cars basically alternative
fuels<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.550> everyone's<00:03:45.820> mind<00:03:46.209> people<00:03:46.600> are

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
fuels is on everyone's mind people are

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.479 
fuels is on everyone's mind people are
concerned<00:03:47.380> about<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.769> environment<00:03:47.890> but<00:03:48.430> also

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
concerned about the environment but also

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.699 
concerned about the environment but also
the<00:03:48.820> hip<00:03:48.970> pocket<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.840> we've<00:03:50.170> got<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.319> collection

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the hip pocket so we've got a collection

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.140 
the hip pocket so we've got a collection
of<00:03:50.769> cars<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.160> they<00:03:51.459> all<00:03:51.610> do<00:03:51.880> different

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
of cars here they all do different

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.120 
of cars here they all do different
things<00:03:52.390> there's<00:03:52.840> some<00:03:52.959> hybrids<00:03:53.440> as<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> diesel

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
things there's some hybrids as a diesel

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.880 
things there's some hybrids as a diesel
we've<00:03:54.250> ever<00:03:54.400> got<00:03:54.610> one<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.910> runs<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.269> gas<00:03:55.890> we

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
we've ever got one that runs on gas we

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.190 
we've ever got one that runs on gas we
chose<00:03:57.160> an<00:03:57.519> around<00:03:57.819> town<00:03:58.060> loop<00:03:58.330> simply<00:03:58.810> because

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
chose an around town loop simply because

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.840 
chose an around town loop simply because
that's<00:03:59.800> what<00:03:59.950> most<00:04:00.130> people<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:00.580> in<00:04:00.790> their

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
that's what most people do in their

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.309 
that's what most people do in their
everyday<00:04:01.180> lives<00:04:01.450> they<00:04:01.750> don't<00:04:01.930> go<00:04:02.050> up<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.230> down

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
everyday lives they don't go up and down

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.680 
everyday lives they don't go up and down
a<00:04:02.380> freeway<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.040> what<00:04:03.760> we<00:04:03.880> found<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.450> an

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
a freeway and what we found is an

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.210 
a freeway and what we found is an
average<00:04:04.900> fuel<00:04:05.050> consumption<00:04:05.440> figure<00:04:05.890> will<00:04:06.100> be

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220
