00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.330
 Merry Christmas and New Year to all 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.210
 you precious many thanks for 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.160
 accompany me this year in the tutorials 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.570
 today I bring you this makeup 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.640
 which is a pretty simple look in 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.410
 golden with red lips do not worry 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.100
 there is also the option of lips 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.740
 neutral if you prefer something more 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.710
 simple and then we will start to apply 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.099
 a shadow test and then taking 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.550
 this shadow of the light gas palette of 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.010
 make it cosmetics I'm taking the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.500
 shadow more clarita to illuminate the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.350
 eyebrow bone and then as color of 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.010
 transition I'm taking this color that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.410
 it's a matt coffee yellow with a lot 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.899
 intensity take very little of the palette 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.920
 and see nothing more than enough to 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.780
 blur around the fold this is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.050
 I'm going to take this shadow that is a coffee 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.420
 reddish with many flashes that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.030
 really do not look much in the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.810
 eyelids but see the intensity of 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 coffee looks just like on the palette I'm going 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.040
 to apply on the edge of the mobile eyelid 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.680
 and I'll be canceling it by the fold 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.380
 upwards without reaching the nose 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.110
 then I'm going to take these shadows in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.180
 golden color of the same palette and 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.900
 I'm going to compact on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.140
 little touches with these new brushes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.390
 motives and with the same brush without 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.380
 clean it or anything I will go back to take 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.869
 the shadow more clarita that will serve me 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.299
 to illuminate the lacrimal as they can 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.479
 see when mixing it with the golden one because it goes to 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.200
 be a very good degradation very good 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.600
 for this part that is the corner 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 inner of the eye then I'm going to take this 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.740
 glue glosses eye brand 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.649
 canecos americas that is the liquid sugar 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 they want to be recommended several times and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.869
 I'm going to apply it on the eyelid 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.210
 and mobile a little bit and in the lacrimal 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.209
 concentrating it to put the glitters 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.610
 golden I'm putting these that are very 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.739
 little ones of the same brand and then 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 I will not continue with the delineated anything 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.450
 very dramatic just to mark 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.569
 the upper lashes and elongate a 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.150
 little the look as you can see the tail 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.819
 or the final part of the wing is very 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.910
 discreet and then I'm going to take these 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.840
 eyelashes that are the iconic of house or 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.470
 flashes that are very showy have a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 particular design that helps us a lot 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.920
 to open my eyes and then I go to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.290
 continue to illuminate the water line 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.470
 with this anastasio crayon I'm going to 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.840
 return to take this color in bada bing 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.780
 from the same palette and I'll blur it 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.079
 below the lower lashes 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.020
 so they do not get lost and I'm going to apply 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.940
 tabs down 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.770
 and remember that this is an optional step 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
 normal I want to show here also 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.350
 how to put with the glue the house or 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.270
 flashes that also putting some 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.580
 how many droplets will it serve 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.820
 immediately I do not know that in as well as 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.890
 it is put and there is a glue 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.380
 so strong that they will last all the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.990
 night is not really taken away 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.750
 remove it with this remover 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.060
 makeup 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.130
 then I will do the control of the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.210
 face and I'm using this new color 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.370

 this brush you motivate and it is also 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.890
 new very practical and the color I feel that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.540
 it's going very well it's a bit dark but it 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 blurs very well after put and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.890
 taking this blush that I loved about 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.530
 romans that made you a coral color with 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.310
 golden flashes that I'm going to blur 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.370

 I knew there was one that is only the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.180
 illuminator and this is the duo that has 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.700
 pink and white and for the lips this is 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.709
 the first option on the red lips to 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.180
 I like red hands 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.740
