they have a condition called klinefelter

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.460 
they have a condition called klinefelter
syndrome<00:03:44.300> which<00:03:45.300> means<00:03:45.600> they<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.959> two<00:03:46.200> X

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
syndrome which means they have two X

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.729 
syndrome which means they have two X
chromosomes<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.340> one<00:03:47.640> y<00:03:47.880> chromosome<00:03:48.739> their

cells undergo the same in activations

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.260 
cells undergo the same in activations
females<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.950> they<00:03:53.070> also<00:03:53.250> express<00:03:53.760> black<00:03:54.060> and

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
females so they also express black and

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.750 
females so they also express black and
brown<00:03:54.390> patches<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.920> only<00:03:56.190> difference<00:03:56.580> is

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
brown patches the only difference is

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.100 
brown patches the only difference is
that<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.060> Y<00:03:57.209> chromosome<00:03:57.690> makes<00:03:58.110> male<00:03:58.850> however

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
that the Y chromosome makes male however

that the Y chromosome makes male however

along with other genetic disadvantages

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:17.460 
along with other genetic disadvantages
so<00:04:08.370> our<00:04:08.519> ok<00:04:08.850> I'll<00:04:08.940> go<00:04:09.090> cats<00:04:09.330> female<00:04:10.370> no<00:04:12.290> buster

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:29.400 

Oh<00:04:27.150> genetic<00:04:28.150> do<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.660> see<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.900> telleth<00:04:29.230> all

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
Oh genetic do you see it telleth all

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:41.810 
Oh genetic do you see it telleth all
female<00:04:29.830> captain<00:04:30.340> Oh<00:04:30.720> baby

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.550 

so<00:04:42.820> this<00:04:43.000> actually<00:04:43.240> wasn't<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.990> our<00:04:44.110> script

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
so this actually wasn't in our script

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.680 
so this actually wasn't in our script
but<00:04:45.040> because<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.670> his<00:04:45.910> little<00:04:46.270> black<00:04:46.360> spot

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
but because of his little black spot

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.090 
but because of his little black spot
here<00:04:46.960> this<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.950> male<00:04:48.190> talent<00:04:48.610> okay
