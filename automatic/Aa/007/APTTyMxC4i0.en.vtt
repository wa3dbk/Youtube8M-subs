a<00:00:27.570> battery<00:00:28.570> backup<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:29.199> solenoid<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.720> got

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
a battery backup a solenoid and you got

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.380 
a battery backup a solenoid and you got
your<00:00:31.960> wall<00:00:32.110> transformer<00:00:32.680> down<00:00:33.370> here<00:00:33.699> so<00:00:34.210> what

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
your wall transformer down here so what

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.810 
your wall transformer down here so what
how<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.780> works<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.980> wall<00:00:36.250> transform<00:00:36.730> which

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
how it works is the wall transform which

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.990 
how it works is the wall transform which
is<00:00:36.910> 12<00:00:37.239> volts<00:00:37.629> at<00:00:37.780> 2<00:00:38.080> amps<00:00:38.430> packs<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.580> power<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
is 12 volts at 2 amps packs to power the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.740 
is 12 volts at 2 amps packs to power the
solenoid<00:00:40.479> and<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:42.190> also<00:00:42.339> powers<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:43.449> board

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
solenoid and it also powers the board

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.799 
solenoid and it also powers the board
the<00:00:44.229> battery<00:00:44.530> backup<00:00:45.010> can<00:00:45.879> be<00:00:46.030> turned<00:00:46.360> on<00:00:46.570> or

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
the battery backup can be turned on or

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.609 
the battery backup can be turned on or
off<00:00:46.900> using<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.920> switch<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.930> battery<00:00:50.080> however

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
off using the switch the battery however

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.039 
off using the switch the battery however
will<00:00:51.040> not<00:00:51.070> power<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.699> solenoid<00:00:52.119> it<00:00:52.330> will<00:00:52.750> act

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
will not power the solenoid it will act

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.049 
will not power the solenoid it will act
to<00:00:53.170> backup<00:00:53.500> power<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:54.190> back<00:00:54.909> up<00:00:55.089> power<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.629> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to backup power I back up power to the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.850 
to backup power I back up power to the
combination<00:00:58.059> lock<00:00:58.210> kit<00:00:58.540> and<00:00:58.720> that's<00:00:59.409> in<00:00:59.650> case

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
combination lock kit and that's in case

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.189 
combination lock kit and that's in case
the<00:01:00.100> power<00:01:00.220> goes<00:01:00.369> out<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.720> want<00:01:01.869> to<00:01:02.019> keep

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
the power goes out and you want to keep

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.799 
the power goes out and you want to keep
the<00:01:02.409> code<00:01:02.589> that<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.799> have<00:01:02.949> programmed<00:01:03.400> into

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the code that you have programmed into

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.590 
the code that you have programmed into
the<00:01:04.809> combination<00:01:05.650> lock<00:01:05.799> kit<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.240> there's<00:01:07.450> no

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
the combination lock kit so there's no

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.090 
the combination lock kit so there's no
back<00:01:07.810> powering<00:01:08.290> from<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.590> battery<00:01:08.920> through

back powering from the battery through
the<00:01:09.250> solenoid<00:01:09.549> anyway<00:01:10.509> we<00:01:11.409> have<00:01:11.560> our<00:01:11.679> battery

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
our battery backup on and let's give it

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.209 
our battery backup on and let's give it
a<00:01:17.859> whirl

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
a whirl

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:25.219 
a whirl
going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> put<00:01:19.240> in<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.390> code<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.750> 1<00:01:20.530> 3<00:01:21.009> 3<00:01:21.039> 2

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.569 

indicator<00:01:26.229> says<00:01:26.469> it's<00:01:26.619> programmed<00:01:27.039> so<00:01:27.490> I'm

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
indicator says it's programmed so I'm

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.800 
indicator says it's programmed so I'm
going<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.759> put<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:27.999> wrong<00:01:28.090> code<00:01:28.359> first<00:01:28.630> to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
going to put in the wrong code first to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.919 
going to put in the wrong code first to
show<00:01:29.049> you<00:01:29.109> what<00:01:29.259> happens<00:01:33.390> BBB<00:01:34.390> prompt<00:01:34.659> code

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
show you what happens BBB prompt code

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.419 
show you what happens BBB prompt code
let's<00:01:35.530> put<00:01:35.679> in<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.799> right<00:01:35.950> code<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.340> watch

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
let's put in the right code and watch

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:43.590 
let's put in the right code and watch
the<00:01:36.609> solenoid<00:01:40.979> solenoid<00:01:41.979> pops<00:01:42.219> in<00:01:42.490> now<00:01:43.359> what

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
the solenoid solenoid pops in now what

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.910 
the solenoid solenoid pops in now what
I'm<00:01:43.659> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.170> because<00:01:44.649> it'll<00:01:44.829> go

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I'm going to do is because it'll go

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.139 
I'm going to do is because it'll go
flying<00:01:45.249> because<00:01:45.490> it's<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:45.819> connected

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
flying because it's not connected

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.270 
flying because it's not connected
anything<00:01:46.359> I'm<00:01:46.869> going<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.109> press<00:01:47.380> any<00:01:47.740> button

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
anything I'm going to press any button

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.929 
anything I'm going to press any button
to<00:01:48.429> release<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.939> solenoid<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.939> solenoid

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
to release the solenoid and the solenoid

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.959 
to release the solenoid and the solenoid
is<00:01:52.030> released<00:01:52.389> now<00:01:52.689> what<00:01:53.619> happens<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.219> I've<00:01:54.700> got

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
is released now what happens is I've got

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.889 
is released now what happens is I've got
my<00:01:54.999> battery<00:01:55.479> back<00:01:56.170> up<00:01:56.200> turn<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.799> on<00:01:56.979> position

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
my battery back up turn to on position

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.910 
my battery back up turn to on position
so<00:01:58.899> I'm<00:01:58.990> going<00:01:59.109> to<00:01:59.170> unplug<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.619> pot<00:01:59.770> at<00:01:59.889> the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
so I'm going to unplug the pot at the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.099 
so I'm going to unplug the pot at the
wall<00:02:00.100> supply<00:02:01.499> and<00:02:02.499> I'm<00:02:02.889> going<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.100> type<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:04.109> the

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
wall supply and I'm going to type in the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.250 
wall supply and I'm going to type in the
same<00:02:05.319> code<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:09.009> relay<00:02:09.310> turns<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
same code the relay turns on but the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.940 
same code the relay turns on but the
solenoid<00:02:11.680> does<00:02:12.100> not<00:02:13.170> depress

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
solenoid does not depress

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.790 
solenoid does not depress
and<00:02:15.130> man<00:02:15.490> that's<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.530> battery

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
and man that's because the battery

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.370 
and man that's because the battery
backup<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.280> literally<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:19.330> trying<00:02:19.930> just

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
backup is literally just trying just
