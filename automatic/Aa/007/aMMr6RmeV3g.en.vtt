see<00:01:49.229> how<00:01:49.829> wide<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.869> handles<00:01:52.200> are

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
see how wide the the handles are

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
see how wide the the handles are
originally<00:01:53.100> when<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.880> were

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
closer like that like the end part right

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
closer like that like the end part right
here<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:57.990> end<00:01:58.290> up

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
here would really actually end up

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 
here would really actually end up
pinching<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.100> ear<00:01:59.340> right<00:02:00.210> behind<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.540> ear

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
there was like an indentation it was

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.300 
there was like an indentation it was
really<00:02:02.610> painful<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.070> fresh

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
really painful and that was really fresh

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.609

quality kind of cheap my old pair
glasses<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.190> got<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> couple<00:02:11.550> years<00:02:11.730> ago<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
glasses I got a couple years ago that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.180 
glasses I got a couple years ago that
recently<00:02:12.300> broke

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
recently broke

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.800 
recently broke
I<00:02:13.280> used<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.700> fall<00:02:13.880> asleep<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.750> they

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I used to fall asleep in them and they

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.420 
I used to fall asleep in them and they
like<00:02:15.020> roll<00:02:15.260> under<00:02:15.500> my<00:02:15.590> body<00:02:15.770> I'm<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.070> pretty<00:02:16.220> big

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
like roll under my body I'm a pretty big

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.610 
like roll under my body I'm a pretty big
guy<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.790> they<00:02:17.120> wouldn't<00:02:17.360> break<00:02:17.540> these<00:02:18.110> I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
guy and they wouldn't break these I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.290 
guy and they wouldn't break these I
suspect<00:02:18.980> would<00:02:19.040> break<00:02:19.220> pretty<00:02:19.700> darn<00:02:19.940> quick<00:02:20.180> if

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
suspect would break pretty darn quick if

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900 
suspect would break pretty darn quick if
the<00:02:20.390> same<00:02:20.540> thing<00:02:20.720> happens<00:02:21.580> then<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> got<00:02:22.820> this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the same thing happens then you got this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.790 
the same thing happens then you got this
other<00:02:23.090> pair<00:02:23.360> again<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.900> pair<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.620> gonna

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
other pair again the pair that I'm gonna

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
other pair again the pair that I'm gonna
probably<00:02:25.010> end<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:25.340> wearing<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.580> little<00:02:25.730> bit

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
probably end up wearing a little bit

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.030 
probably end up wearing a little bit
more<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.180> think<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.950> these

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
more I think and you can see that these

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.420 
more I think and you can see that these
are<00:02:28.220> pretty<00:02:28.490> sturdy<00:02:29.450> made<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.230> there's<00:02:31.190> kind

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
are pretty sturdy made but there's kind

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.670 
are pretty sturdy made but there's kind
of<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.670> line<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.540> kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.200> that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
of a line you can kind of see it that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.960 
of a line you can kind of see it that
goes<00:02:33.830> through<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.070> frame<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.550> doesn't

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
goes through the frame it doesn't

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.330 
goes through the frame it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:35.720> strike<00:02:36.020> me<00:02:36.080> as<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.410> strongest<00:02:37.070> build

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
doesn't strike me as the strongest build

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.430 
doesn't strike me as the strongest build
quality<00:02:37.520> on<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.820> one<00:02:38.000> either<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.320> does

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
feel a little bit better probably still

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390
