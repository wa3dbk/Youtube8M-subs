00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hey people nice that you turned on 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 I'm the jörg and I want to go with you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.010
 you like to have a question today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 In spite of the offensive in the matter loaded 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.769
 clarify or discuss with you like that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.170
 Whole because ever so runs and yes how 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 when you get some blood and me 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 guess that's right for most 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 would be interesting in treysa for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 serious that is an event that begins 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 Saturday apologies Fridays around 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 19 o'clock and lasts exactly until tuesday 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.279
 For the weekly it was called after that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 So only then again two or three 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 days break and then it starts again 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 new and the whole thing is actually running as well 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 a big rage or a glass one 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 Camera that is really like that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.270
 character gets her once a week 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 so to speak , it loads the whole looks 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.690
 as follows 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 you have your dealer here or 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 this one down here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 bought a ticket 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 The ticket can be found in your inventory 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 if you already have it here with me eg 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.840
 it is currently empty and it shows 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.820
 to you how many victories or defeats 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 you got 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 if you enter victories then see 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 you have different rewards 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.369
 stages for eight wins and thus 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 logically then a defeat 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 At least you can buy this item 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 but it does not stay that way no you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 You can also buy that and buy that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.400
 buy so you get the whole load 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.220
 table to her here you see can you 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.369
 buy it just by being careful 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.140
 victories and the whole thing only works 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 a single time with your character 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.600
 if you except the robe or now 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.110
 the weapon you can buy more often than 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.689
 once 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.320
 but these things are gold level here 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.720
 reward 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 silver level reward bronze and on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 this stone reward 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.290
 gets her only once with 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.780
 your character will be the ticket 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.580
 or you can have a new one below 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.440
 ticket buy and start again at zero 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.390
 we just assume for example you play 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.729
 the trials on what you have just 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.229
 Two or three wins managed the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 rest you have lost then you can 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.790
 want to buy these two things immediately 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.530
 after that your ticket will either be reset 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 or as I said he bought new and hers 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.430
 have of course the chance then to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 this reward level is silver and the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.780
 gold reward level the two here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.600
 the front then disappeared and the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.459
 you do not get more and that with you 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.500
 each one character once a week 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.380
 just like in the cabaret or in the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.660
 as a glassy companion 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 Once upon a time the chance once invited the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.410
 week per character 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.730
 otherwise that would have to be with another 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 make character again then they are 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.239
 of course, say free here again 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.690
 you do not have a thin thin one yet 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.670
 have on it or ticket lusis on it so 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 Now you can do something very special 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.360
 that is why this is also true 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.519
 exam ticket to 9 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 and I have here from ours 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.000
 our cute partner the puzzles 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.080
 on xbox plays link you will find 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.489
 Of course, below in the description 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.780
 I was allowed a few screenshots 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.250
 make 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.290
 because I could unfortunately yesterday 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.560
 I do not play the transfers 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.810
 that today but not only he on the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.390
 next game for example and guide sol de 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.480
 All three got the flörsheim 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.920
 her the scream said to that and with 9 7 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 and 0 defeats, there is something 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.320
 special you can count on one like that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.400
 the mentioned new social spot 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.459
 you on the mercury 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.620
 that is then directly free contribution 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.380
 based and there you can travel and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.579
 There you have a box with an eagle 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.360
 on the top screenshot I dazzle 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.390
 of course one 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.019
 and there are songs here 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.060
 blood pro per character once per 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.920
 Event once a week 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.060
 with the same character then with her 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.750
 can also with the same character 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.950
 definitely buy a new ticket or the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.590
 to reset the ticket 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.410
 That's up to you but you can 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.300
 Do not put in blood again that sounds 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.370
 as I said once again the offer of 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.360
 Traders will definitely stay the same 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.220
 so and yes as I said that was it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.510
 actually already in things I invited 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.670
 think there is much more 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.010
 Not at the moment to say that 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.470
 have tried it for example that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.880
 the passport has that for me as a daddy 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.060
 that happened only then tried 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.799
 he has his ticket so to speak new 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.420
 solved that means he already had 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.829
 one with accordingly many victories or 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.660
 Lower long it depending on region 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.280
 has run and has a new ticket 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.200
 solved and as I said this offer from 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.389
 student will not reset so once 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.940
 Bought always bought it then yours 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.290
 character bound 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.000
 and that was it from my side me 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.210
 Hope the load is a bit now 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.010
 clearer or how the whole sounds the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.830
 chance in the last box is again 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.680
 as usual there is no exot in it 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.140
 are in legendary main weapon in it with 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.039
 Batteries poor teachers at flames already 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.479
 everything imaginable 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.380
 So the typical equipment and yes there 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.750
 in any case hinmarschieren times 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
 ethereal light and something you get 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.620
 both down there with the student 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.030

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.140
 packages and as I said this box 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.940

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.710
 Thank you for watching if that is 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.389

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.380
