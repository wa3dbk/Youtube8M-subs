smack<00:00:43.000> about<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.240> week<00:00:43.480> ago<00:00:43.600> I've<00:00:43.960> been<00:00:44.080> playing

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
smack about a week ago I've been playing

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290 
smack about a week ago I've been playing
with<00:00:44.530> it<00:00:44.590> I've<00:00:44.920> done<00:00:45.160> some<00:00:45.430> various<00:00:45.850> load<00:00:46.060> outs

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
with it I've done some various load outs

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.560 
with it I've done some various load outs
and<00:00:47.850> finally<00:00:48.850> settled<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.000> seem

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
and finally settled on one that I seem

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.790 
and finally settled on one that I seem
to<00:00:52.810> like<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.470> seems<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.130> work<00:00:54.310> out<00:00:54.490> okay

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to like that seems to work out okay

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.470 
to like that seems to work out okay
first<00:00:56.800> things<00:00:56.980> first<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.400> stock<00:00:57.760> build<00:00:58.060> just

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
first things first the stock build just

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.240 
first things first the stock build just
didn't<00:00:59.110> work<00:00:59.230> out<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.500> me<00:00:59.680> because<00:00:59.860> number

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
didn't work out for me because number

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.200 
didn't work out for me because number
one<00:01:00.280> ran<00:01:00.640> too<00:01:00.850> hot<00:01:01.120> number<00:01:01.810> two<00:01:01.989> just<00:01:02.590> seemed

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
one ran too hot number two just seemed

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590 
one ran too hot number two just seemed
relatively<00:01:04.210> ineffective<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.640> let's<00:01:06.760> go<00:01:06.880> over

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
relatively ineffective so let's go over

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.440 
relatively ineffective so let's go over
what<00:01:07.630> would<00:01:08.050> I<00:01:08.080> put<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:08.500> here<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> took<00:01:10.180> out

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
what would I put on here so I took out

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.320 
what would I put on here so I took out
the<00:01:11.050> other<00:01:11.200> energy<00:01:11.830> weapons<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:12.910> put<00:01:13.120> three

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
the other energy weapons and I put three

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.969 
the other energy weapons and I put three
medium<00:01:13.630> lasers<00:01:14.020> in<00:01:14.260> all<00:01:14.530> three<00:01:15.000> laser<00:01:16.000> slots

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
medium lasers in all three laser slots

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.999 
medium lasers in all three laser slots
through<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.190> AMS<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.680> went<00:01:20.680> with<00:01:20.830> my

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
that I like running on most of my max

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.999 
that I like running on most of my max
when<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.509> act<00:01:28.720> five<00:01:28.960> locks<00:01:29.440> up<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.860> AC

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
when the you act five locks up the AC

when the you act five locks up the AC
two<00:01:30.369> is<00:01:30.580> still<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.150> harassment<00:01:31.509> mode<00:01:31.990> and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
shaking the hut of the other mech then I

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.980 
shaking the hut of the other mech then I
went<00:01:36.430> with<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:37.030> had<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.479> lot<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.660> trouble<00:01:37.900> with

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
went with I had a lot of trouble with

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.100 
went with I had a lot of trouble with
this<00:01:38.140> one<00:01:39.330> originally<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.360> wanted<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.780> put<00:01:40.930> some

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
this one originally I wanted to put some

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.280 
this one originally I wanted to put some
srms<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.130> make<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:43.200> basically<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
srms in there and make this basically a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.420 
srms in there and make this basically a
brawler<00:01:45.300> up<00:01:46.300> close<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.810> personal<00:01:46.840> mech<00:01:47.430> but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
brawler up close and personal mech but

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.840 
brawler up close and personal mech but
the<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.330> end<00:01:49.479> o<00:01:49.630> steel<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.770> was<00:01:51.490> running

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
the with the end o steel I was running

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.140 
the with the end o steel I was running
out<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.620> slots<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:54.010> still<00:01:54.460> had<00:01:54.610> tonnage<00:01:54.909> left

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
out of slots and still had tonnage left

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.320 
out of slots and still had tonnage left
over<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:55.630> what<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:55.900> did<00:01:56.020> was<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.590> put<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:57.130> lrm<00:01:57.790> 15

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
over so what I did was I put the lrm 15

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.070 
over so what I did was I put the lrm 15
in<00:01:58.600> here<00:01:59.220> with<00:02:00.220> uh<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.790> think<00:02:01.000> it's<00:02:01.120> four<00:02:01.930> times

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
in here with uh I think it's four times

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.200 
in here with uh I think it's four times
amo<00:02:02.470> but<00:02:02.830> we'll<00:02:03.280> check<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.580> out<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.880> see

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
amo but we'll check it out and see

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.759 
amo but we'll check it out and see
what's<00:02:04.570> up<00:02:04.890> XL<00:02:05.890> 315<00:02:06.610> engine<00:02:07.270> puts<00:02:07.990> me<00:02:08.140> at<00:02:08.229> 68

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
what's up XL 315 engine puts me at 68

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.960 
what's up XL 315 engine puts me at 68
kph<00:02:09.340> which<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.729> pretty<00:02:09.910> good<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:12.610> look<00:02:12.760> at

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
kph which is pretty good let's look at

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.030 
kph which is pretty good let's look at
look<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> bills<00:02:13.840> start<00:02:14.230> from<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.620> right

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
look at the bills start from the right

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.009 
look at the bills start from the right
side<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.580> work<00:02:15.700> over<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.269> your<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:16.810> arm

let them fly you see here that the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.530 
let them fly you see here that the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
launch arc on the missiles coming out of

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.960 
launch arc on the missiles coming out of
the<00:05:40.660> shoulder<00:05:41.050> it's<00:05:41.260> not<00:05:41.470> not<00:05:42.220> like<00:05:42.310> catapults

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
the shoulder it's not not like catapults

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.490 
the shoulder it's not not like catapults
where<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.180> goes<00:05:43.270> straight<00:05:43.750> out<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.110> then<00:05:44.320> up

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
where it goes straight out and then up

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
where it goes straight out and then up
and<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.700> not<00:05:45.850> directly<00:05:46.810> like<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:47.520> doctors

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and it's not directly like the doctors

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.310 
and it's not directly like the doctors
as<00:05:48.640> well<00:05:48.670> as<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.330> one<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.810> know<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.050> shoots

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
as well as this one you know it shoots

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320 
as well as this one you know it shoots
at<00:05:50.500> about<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.860> 45<00:05:51.400> degree<00:05:51.580> angle<00:05:51.790> which<00:05:52.150> makes

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
at about a 45 degree angle which makes

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.900 
at about a 45 degree angle which makes
it<00:05:52.480> perfect<00:05:52.750> for<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.710> city<00:05:54.280> map<00:05:54.460> kind<00:05:54.730> of<00:05:54.790> like

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
it perfect for a city map kind of like

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.000 
it perfect for a city map kind of like
this<00:05:55.060> because<00:05:55.270> you<00:05:55.480> can<00:05:55.600> launch<00:05:55.780> them<00:05:56.020> over

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
this because you can launch them over

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.460 
this because you can launch them over
the<00:05:57.130> buildings<00:05:57.550> with<00:05:57.730> ease<00:05:58.230> as<00:05:59.230> long<00:05:59.440> as

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
the buildings with ease as long as
