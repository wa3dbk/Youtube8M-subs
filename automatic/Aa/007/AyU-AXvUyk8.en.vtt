attacking each other they just stand

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.330 
attacking each other they just stand
there<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.970> instead<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.540> attacking<00:03:49.750> me<00:03:50.340> even

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.279 

so<00:05:46.159> there<00:05:46.310> now<00:05:46.849> you<00:05:46.909> see<00:05:47.300> his<00:05:47.599> default<00:05:48.139> weapon

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
whatever the hell that is

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.939 
whatever the hell that is
think<00:05:53.000> it's<00:05:53.120> fun<00:05:53.419> stick<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:53.990> his<00:05:54.500> default

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
think it's fun stick and his default

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.110 
think it's fun stick and his default
weapon<00:05:55.130> is<00:05:55.669> a<00:05:55.969> a<00:05:56.539> are<00:05:57.110> two<00:05:57.590> things<00:05:58.099> I<00:05:58.340> think

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.760 
weapon is a a are two things I think
that<00:05:59.419> it's<00:05:59.960> called<00:06:01.659> but<00:06:02.659> anyways<00:06:02.990> if<00:06:03.199> I<00:06:03.380> go<00:06:03.680> in

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
that it's called but anyways if I go in

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.980 
that it's called but anyways if I go in
here<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:05.409> SMG<00:06:06.520> now<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:07.550> can<00:06:07.909> spawn<00:06:08.270> another<00:06:08.810> one

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
here and SMG now I can spawn another one

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.490 
here and SMG now I can spawn another one
him

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
him

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.080 
him
you<00:06:09.889> know<00:06:09.979> I've<00:06:10.099> nestled<00:06:10.460> date<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.880> can

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
you know I've nestled date that can

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.070 
you know I've nestled date that can
spawn<00:06:11.479> another<00:06:12.050> one

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
spawn another one

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.480 
spawn another one
not<00:06:13.800> necessarily<00:06:14.930> no<00:06:15.930> hit<00:06:16.289> tell<00:06:16.530> SMG<00:06:17.190> instead

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
not necessarily no hit tell SMG instead

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.580 
not necessarily no hit tell SMG instead
of<00:06:17.580> pistol<00:06:17.879> now<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:18.389> spawned<00:06:18.810> another<00:06:19.080> one<00:06:19.349> with

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
of pistol now I spawned another one with

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.710 
of pistol now I spawned another one with
him<00:06:20.810> messing<00:06:21.810> day<00:06:21.930> instead<00:06:22.139> of<00:06:22.289> a<00:06:22.379> stunt<00:06:22.620> spit

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
him messing day instead of a stunt spit

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.520 
him messing day instead of a stunt spit
so<00:06:25.970> basically<00:06:26.970> that<00:06:27.300> just<00:06:27.539> changes<00:06:27.840> look<00:06:28.020> now
