00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.440
 but not 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.360
 or a mini craft is that such today 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.940
 I bring a video of a pack of tricks 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.939
 since I do not have much time are 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.460
 little ones and well let's see them in 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.849
 First of all we have a trick that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.759
 is that the ender berries and the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.160
 normal do not come together then we can 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.520
 enter our branch in our farm 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.399
 feed our animals and go out 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.090
 easily without us escaping and without 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.609
 being bullied also has a chance 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.859
 decorative utility and we can 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.079
 use to decorate our house or 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.960
 for survival maps and for 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.600
 adventures that we upload to the internet we are going to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.609
 for the second good trick in this 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.820
 second trick let's see how to get 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.589
 a very high amount of wood form 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.150
 easy quick and easy we have to 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.990
 place a tower of three blocks of 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.440
 wood and give cane with the bulb to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.440
 see how 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.210
 and nothing that we have this tree is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.310
 pretty big 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.720
 I have seen bigger trees but yes 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.000
 that it is true that there is a probability 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.980
 that they come out smaller not so 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 small as normal ones but yes that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.970
 a little smaller than this one and nothing 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.240
 apply only works with oak no 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.670
 with the others and this we are going to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.510
 the third good trick here we have the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.180
 third and last trick is the most 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.010
 shocking so to speak because it is 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.900
 water below that fire underwater 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.510
 and the truth is very cool to do 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.410
 adventure maps and sets we're going to 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.970
 see its construction I'm going to do it outside 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.310
 of water because good is the same 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.190
 it has to be all ready that is to say no 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 can see around here blocks is to say you 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.830
 you can not do what I'm going to explain 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.020
 now it has to be completely or 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.860
 it has to be in the block just 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.910
 Y 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.140
 the trick is this we have to put here 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 ice we take it off and it gets good inside 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.090
 of water will generate a current in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.460
 which will be able to be the water and already 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 is after you do not remove this block 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.290
 because if it's not going to generate water and it goes and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.590
 will pay but do not worry 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.470
 why 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.660
 with the passage of time this block will 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.170
 he will go alone and he will stay like this 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.170
 with fire inside like a stream 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.060
 of water without the ice on top and let's 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.330
 build here one already in step so that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 you see it would be like the block 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.220
 to see if you can 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.489
 and it's already from outside you can not see 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.580
 directly the block of ice but 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.349
 you feel if although with time I have already 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.950
 said that it will be removed but for example if 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.890
 you take it off now it's going to pay good this 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.489
 It has been all for today I tell you that inside 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.980
 a few days I'll upload a video about this that 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.959
 you are seeing behind me is going to be a 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.170
 secret camera so we are attentive to 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.739
 my channel if you want to see a greeting and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.739
 until next time
