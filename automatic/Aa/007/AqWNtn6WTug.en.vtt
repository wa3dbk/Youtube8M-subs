00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello everyone today I bring you a sweet that 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 sure have you ever eaten it is 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.289
 of the bones in case someone does not 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.299
 know tell him it's a cookie made 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.730
 of wafers stuffed with cocoa butter 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.020
 and covered with chocolate 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 ingredients that we are going to use to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 make 6 bones are 8 cookies 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.699
 rectangular ice cream 200 grams of cream 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.499
 of cocoa in this case nutella 150 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 grams of milk chocolate to be able 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.869
 be 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.019
 milka and a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019
 sunflower 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 The first thing we will do is to put in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.610
 microwave the cocoa cream for 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 soften the and make it easier to spread 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 the cookies I put a minute in the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 Defrost function after anoint 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.720
 of nutella the cookies for the side 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.670
 to form four layers the layer does not 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.680
 It must be very thick but neither should it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.310
 see the cookie more or less like the one 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310
 you see in the video 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.590
 Once we have them ready we will do 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.630
 a little bit of pressure for them to join 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 well and the one that does not excel the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.750
 we will remove with the knife 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.759
 we'll have it in the fridge about 30 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.710
 minutes until it hardens and if not 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.340
 you can wait it can be 10 minutes in 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.680
 the freezer to remove them cut them 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.049
 in three equal parts by the side more 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.830
 long to imitate much more the little bone 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.930
 original 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.700
 and meanwhile we will melt the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.090
 chocolate in the microwave or in the bathroom 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.090
 Mary 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.400
 and then we will add a teaspoon 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.930
 of sunflower oil so that when 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.970
 return to its original state do not miss us 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.950
 It is very hard and we only have left 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.440
 bathe each little bone until covered by 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.170
 complete for it to help you from a 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520
 grate so that the excess falls 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.040
 you can do it or daub it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 directly in your bowl or put it 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.340
 first on the grid and go bathing 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.720
 little by little and if you want the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.790
 bottom part when the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.300
 first you turn around and finish 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.300
 bathing 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.459
 When I finished jce let them harden 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.129
 in the grid and they will be ready to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.659
 serve that yes yes it is summer I recommend you 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.549
 that you keep them in the refrigerator and 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.180
 get them out about five minutes before 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.180
 consume them 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.660
 and so we have the classic bones but 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250
 Now that Valentine arrives, you can not 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.050
 have a special occasion you can see 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.420
 than using a cookie cutter 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.319
 we can make the same recipe but 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.319
 giving it an original touch 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.560
 the mechanism itself we are going to put 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.630
 four layers of cookies 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.550
 the xunta we will do we will put pressure on 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.300
 them and we will keep them a fridge at 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.300
 30 minutes 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 and if you want to make a bone cake 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.630
 you just have to put three 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 cookies together and about ten 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.860
 rows of cookies and follow the same 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.270
 procedure and I assure you that when 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.100
 had in your guests are going to 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.100
 be surprised with the presentation 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.459
 if it does not tell you sunflower oil you have 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.770
 than to use an oil that is very soft 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.270
 so it does not taste like chocolate and 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.610
 By the way if anyone wants too 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.960
 You can bathe them in white chocolate or 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.760
 you can make them mixed 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.680
 Well some do not know where to buy these 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.660
 You can find cookies in all 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 the supermarkets but as I said 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.800
 buy them better rectangular because yes 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.220
 when cutting them they better mimic the way 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.220
 the bones 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.860
 so I hope you do very soon 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.750
 these homemade bones because surely 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.030
 they will fly off the table and they will like both 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.650
 big as small you can also 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.720
 make them to give away because their 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.730
 presentation is very showy to power 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.590
 use different cutters like these 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.349
 hearts that for a romantic song 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.940
 They are ideal and you know that if you have 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.280

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.920

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.660
