welding<00:00:22.869> mask<00:00:23.050> which<00:00:24.010> is<00:00:24.039> like<00:00:24.340> if<00:00:24.610> you<00:00:24.730> don't

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
welding mask which is like if you don't

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.689 
welding mask which is like if you don't
know<00:00:25.030> is<00:00:25.330> when<00:00:25.510> you're<00:00:25.630> welding<00:00:26.100> the<00:00:27.100> gas<00:00:27.130> will

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
know is when you're welding the gas will

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.600 
know is when you're welding the gas will
be<00:00:27.820> crispy<00:00:28.360> and<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.949> gas<00:00:30.100> will<00:00:30.310> form<00:00:30.550> a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
be crispy and or the gas will form a

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.729 
be crispy and or the gas will form a
layer<00:00:30.820> over<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.270> weld<00:00:31.930> and<00:00:32.169> you<00:00:32.319> have<00:00:32.409> to<00:00:32.529> chip

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
layer over the weld and you have to chip

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.540 
layer over the weld and you have to chip
it<00:00:32.859> off<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:34.769> it's<00:00:35.769> just<00:00:36.039> like<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.219> cover

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
it off and it's just like a cover

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.489 
it off and it's just like a cover
material<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.420> make<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.749> well<00:00:37.929> cleaner<00:00:38.289> to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
material to make the well cleaner to

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.380 
material to make the well cleaner to
block<00:00:39.010> oxygen<00:00:39.579> from<00:00:39.729> the<00:00:39.789> web<00:00:39.999> while<00:00:40.210> you're
