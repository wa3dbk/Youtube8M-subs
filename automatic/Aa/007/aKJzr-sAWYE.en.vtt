00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
 hi friends of you tube frikis hahahaha good to all and this time I bring 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.400
 a video about the damn video games censored if those video games that 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.039
 guilt of the children of manizales urán the most chingones videogames 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.650
 Well, that's not what videogame classifications are for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 fucking mother yes that boils the blood of all those assholes that because of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.070
 they censor the video games that we all enjoy the most 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 and there are times that what we enjoy the most is the blood censuses watered by all 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.859
 parts 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 members detached from the victim's body 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.920
 I'm going to finish the video and I'm going to go crazy xd xd xd xd xd 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.750
 hand 2 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 video game of the already controversial North American company roque estar 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 the saga is about a serial killer who gets involved in a movie he's not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160
 to end the goal is to make deaths as bloody as possible 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.350
 Even before it was published, the controversy has been stoked, especially 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.930
 decision on the part of some countries of the European Union to launch the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.700
 video game in their markets 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 It also resulted in a statement by union leaders about the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.300
 possibility of making a blacklist of video games that will veto its sale 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.970
 all this has caused that its developer had to revise it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.050
 and reduce their level of violence 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.510
 but as we said, this was not the first videogame to be banned 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.790
 one of the most famous cases was deadly kombat developed by midway games in 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.720
 1992 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.580
 this was a fighting videogame in which he participated in a tournament in the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.650
 that you had to end up with different enemies 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.630
 It was not the first videogame that appeared in this genre and of course 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.160
 It was not the first game in which violence and death was an act of 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.230
 appearance but the controversy came to life because of scenes of special 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.720
 violence and a lot of blood 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.600
 besides having a graphic design very similar to real images so 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.280
 less for what you could see for the time 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.179
 another well-known case was that of carmagedón published in 1997 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.580
 in this case more than the level of violence surprised the nature of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.330
 is 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.130
 it was a car racing video game 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.050
 up to here all normal but what brought the controversy and fame was that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.659
 they got extra score when moss pedestrians were running over 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.689
 this sample of gratuitous violence raised the anger of many sectors of 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.370
 the society 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.520
 even though it was explicitly stated that its content was 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.579
 exclusively for adults 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.780
