rocker<00:00:26.170> so<00:00:26.530> what<00:00:26.680> this<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:27.120> its<00:00:28.120> reverse

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
rocker so what this is its reverse

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.480 
rocker so what this is its reverse
camber<00:00:28.690> between<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.140> bindings<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.800> positive

as a rock band checking it so this is
just<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.719> carbon<00:01:01.960> band<00:01:02.289> placed<00:01:02.589> under<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.519> core

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
just a carbon band placed under the core

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.670 
just a carbon band placed under the core
this<00:01:03.969> makes<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.390> really<00:01:04.600> smooth<00:01:04.960> ride<00:01:05.229> really

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680

easy to ride so when you start and
linking<00:01:07.420> your<00:01:07.540> turns<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.290> ball<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.560> going<00:01:08.619> to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
linking your turns this ball is going to

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.249 
linking your turns this ball is going to
be<00:01:08.829> great<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:09.219> that

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
be great for that

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.459 
be great for that
Vioxx<00:01:11.259> all<00:01:11.530> fiberglass<00:01:11.890> layup<00:01:12.369> so<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.290> just

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
Vioxx all fiberglass layup so this just

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.620 
Vioxx all fiberglass layup so this just
adds<00:01:14.680> extra<00:01:15.189> pop<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.729> bit<00:01:15.939> more<00:01:16.149> torsional

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
adds extra pop and a bit more torsional

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.740 
adds extra pop and a bit more torsional
flex<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:17.110> it's<00:01:17.350> still<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.399> be<00:01:18.759> quite

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
flex so it's still going to be quite

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.359 
flex so it's still going to be quite
stiff<00:01:19.960> along<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.350> board<00:01:20.560> gives<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.250> really

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
stiff along the board gives it really

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.789 
stiff along the board gives it really
good<00:01:21.520> drive<00:01:21.939> into<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.270> turns<00:01:22.509> but<00:01:22.869> it's<00:01:23.710> still

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
good drive into the turns but it's still

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.190 
good drive into the turns but it's still
going<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.070> be<00:01:24.130> quite<00:01:24.310> playful<00:01:24.579> as<00:01:24.909> well<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
it's not really an advanced board so if

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.209 
it's not really an advanced board so if
you're<00:01:37.990> more<00:01:38.500> advanced<00:01:38.829> I'll<00:01:38.979> go<00:01:39.070> for

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
you're more advanced I'll go for

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.620 
you're more advanced I'll go for
something<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.549> bit<00:01:39.579> more<00:01:39.909> aggressive<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.450> bit

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
something a bit more aggressive a bit

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.779 
something a bit more aggressive a bit
more<00:01:40.780> stiffer<00:01:41.079> but<00:01:42.009> yet<00:01:42.159> for<00:01:42.189> beginners<00:01:42.670> this

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
more stiffer but yet for beginners this

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.950 
more stiffer but yet for beginners this
board<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.149> going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.299> be<00:01:43.420> absolutely<00:01:43.869> perfect
