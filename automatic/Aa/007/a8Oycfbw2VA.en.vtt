misses if you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.370 
misses if you
you<00:02:08.130> know<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.490> really<00:02:09.390> close<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.050> vehicle

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
you know get really close to a vehicle

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
you know get really close to a vehicle
like<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:13.080> yes<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.850> an<00:02:15.000> endless

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
like that and yes so it is an endless

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.559 
like that and yes so it is an endless
runner<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.459> most<00:02:17.459> regards<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.120> suppose<00:02:18.390> so

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
runner in in most regards I suppose so

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.210 
runner in in most regards I suppose so
if<00:02:18.600> you're<00:02:18.840> completely<00:02:19.260> sort<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.770> sworn<00:02:20.100> off

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
if you're completely sort of sworn off

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.340 
if you're completely sort of sworn off
of<00:02:20.400> those<00:02:20.550> then<00:02:20.940> yeah<00:02:21.540> maybe<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.050> isn't

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
of those then yeah maybe this isn't

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.380 
of those then yeah maybe this isn't
gonna<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.370> you're<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:23.580> or<00:02:24.209> if

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you just want a nicely competitive

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.630 
you just want a nicely competitive
simple<00:02:27.570> racing<00:02:28.140> game<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.590> then<00:02:29.130> I'm<00:02:29.520> actually

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
simple racing game and then I'm actually

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.890 
simple racing game and then I'm actually
quite<00:02:29.910> enjoying<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.810> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
quite enjoying this I think this is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.610 
quite enjoying this I think this is
pretty<00:02:31.080> good<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:33.570> guess<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.380> guess<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
pretty good the I guess I guess the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
pretty good the I guess I guess the
thing<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.040> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> liked<00:02:35.489> about<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
thing that I kind of liked about it is

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.760 
thing that I kind of liked about it is
that<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.160> does<00:02:38.760> get<00:02:38.970> quite<00:02:39.209> tricky<00:02:39.770> so

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that it really does get quite tricky so

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.440 
that it really does get quite tricky so
weaving<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.580> out<00:02:41.700> between<00:02:41.910> all<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.300> these

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
weaving in and out between all of these

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.540 
weaving in and out between all of these
vehicles<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.050> then<00:02:43.230> keeping<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.190> mind<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
vehicles and then keeping in mind that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.259 
vehicles and then keeping in mind that
you<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> sort<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.930> switch<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.269> switch

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
you have to sort of switch to the switch

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.670 
you have to sort of switch to the switch
to<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> sort<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.900> fuelling<00:02:49.290> lane<00:02:49.440> at<00:02:49.590> one

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
to the sort of fuelling lane at one

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.160 
to the sort of fuelling lane at one
point<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.070> smash<00:02:50.370> into<00:02:50.550> you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
point as smash into you

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.840 
point as smash into you
don't<00:02:52.170> ever<00:02:52.410> show<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.800> sign<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.280> weakness<00:02:53.519> my

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
don't ever show a sign of weakness my

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.190 
don't ever show a sign of weakness my
lad<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:56.100> know<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.900> switching<00:02:57.900> between<00:02:58.019> this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
lad you know like switching between this

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.479 
lad you know like switching between this
it<00:02:58.380> does<00:02:58.530> take<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.040> fair<00:02:59.280> bit<00:02:59.459> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
it does take it a fair bit of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.520 
it does take it a fair bit of
concentration<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:01.080> think<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.410> that's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
concentration and I think that that's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.020 
concentration and I think that that's
quite<00:03:01.709> cool<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.100> also<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.550> colourful

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
quite cool it's also really colourful

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.420 
quite cool it's also really colourful
and<00:03:03.150> bright<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.630> sunny<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:05.040> kind<00:03:05.370> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and bright and sunny and that kind of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.910 
and bright and sunny and that kind of
just<00:03:05.670> appeals<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.090> me<00:03:06.209> visually<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.780> why<00:03:07.680> we

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
just appeals to me visually and why we

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280 
just appeals to me visually and why we
go<00:03:08.040> look<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.519> go<00:03:08.750> look<00:03:09.750> at<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.230> a

go look here we go look at that for a
little<00:03:10.440> bit<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.860> skill<00:03:11.190> look<00:03:11.519> at<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.030> need

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
little bit of skill look at that I need

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
little bit of skill look at that I need
to<00:03:13.110> fit<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.560> there<00:03:14.010> we<00:03:14.310> go<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:16.040> yeah<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.310> I

leveled up to level 5 oh here we go
well<00:03:52.079> things<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.920> about<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.280> get<00:03:53.549> incredible

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
well things are about to get incredible

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.630 
well things are about to get incredible
right<00:03:54.390> now<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:55.320> can<00:03:55.440> also<00:03:55.560> share<00:03:56.100> an<00:03:56.280> image<00:03:56.459> or

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
right now you can also share an image or

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.789 
right now you can also share an image or
whatever<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.060> you've<00:03:57.299> got<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:57.799> it

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
whatever it is that you've got there it

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.680 
whatever it is that you've got there it
takes<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.700> little<00:04:00.090> bit<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.420> loading

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
takes that so a little bit of a loading

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.620 
takes that so a little bit of a loading
time<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.680> game<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:02.519> sort<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.790> visuals

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
time the game this sort of visuals

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.990 
time the game this sort of visuals
stutter<00:04:04.140> every<00:04:04.739> once<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.130> while<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
stutter every once in a while this is a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.849 
stutter every once in a while this is a
slightly<00:04:06.510> early<00:04:07.019> build<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.380> game's<00:04:07.530> not<00:04:07.709> out

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
slightly early build the game's not out

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.640 
slightly early build the game's not out
just<00:04:07.890> yet<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.269> things<00:04:10.079> are<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.530> know

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
just yet and so things are you know

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.890 
just yet and so things are you know
things<00:04:10.950> may<00:04:11.370> well<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.700> tweaked<00:04:11.970> soon<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.600> I

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
things may well be tweaked soon and I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.509 
things may well be tweaked soon and I
can<00:04:13.049> buy<00:04:13.200> myself<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.590> new<00:04:13.739> car<00:04:14.010> or<00:04:14.190> at<00:04:14.310> least<00:04:14.430> I

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
can buy myself a new car or at least I

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.969 
can buy myself a new car or at least I
could<00:04:15.090> theoretically<00:04:15.510> need<00:04:15.930> $20,000<00:04:16.859> which

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
could theoretically need $20,000 which

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.370 
could theoretically need $20,000 which
isn't<00:04:17.160> actually<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.820> much

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
isn't actually that much

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.920 
isn't actually that much
I've<00:04:19.799> already<00:04:20.130> maximized<00:04:21.000> all<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.419> my<00:04:21.540> engine

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.360 
I've already maximized all of my engine
running<00:04:22.230> gear<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.410> body<00:04:22.650> these<00:04:22.889> kind<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.190> just

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
running gear and body these kind of just

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.570 
running gear and body these kind of just

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
really good auto driver with very

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.230 
really good auto driver with very
responsive<00:05:07.350> controls<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:08.010> nice<00:05:08.280> little<00:05:08.550> extra

Lane<00:05:09.419> mechanic<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.260> quite<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.710> this

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
Lane mechanic that I quite like this

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.190 
Lane mechanic that I quite like this
this<00:05:11.700> fuel<00:05:12.030> system<00:05:12.600> I<00:05:12.660> think<00:05:12.870> works<00:05:13.020> really

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
this fuel system I think works really

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.719 
this fuel system I think works really
well<00:05:13.440> adds<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.830> nice<00:05:14.100> little<00:05:14.280> element<00:05:14.639> of

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
well adds a nice little element of

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.670 
well adds a nice little element of
danger<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:16.039> the<00:05:17.039> crash<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:17.750> a-ok<00:05:18.750> as<00:05:18.960> well<00:05:19.169> so

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
danger and the crash is a-ok as well so

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.250 
danger and the crash is a-ok as well so
nice<00:05:19.830> smash<00:05:20.130> into<00:05:20.430> some<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.699> these<00:05:20.760> guys<00:05:21.000> I

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
nice smash into some of these guys I

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260 
nice smash into some of these guys I
like<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.350> you<00:05:22.560> feel<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.669> full<00:05:23.850> force

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
like a you feel the full force

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
like a you feel the full force
louia<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:24.930> smashed<00:05:25.889> into<00:05:26.039> things<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.460> then

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
louia and smashed into things and then

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.190 
louia and smashed into things and then
you<00:05:26.669> get<00:05:26.729> little<00:05:26.940> pile<00:05:27.539> ups<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:27.900> stuff<00:05:27.960> and

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
you get little pile ups and stuff and

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.560
