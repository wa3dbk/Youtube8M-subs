I'll<00:00:27.820> break<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.330> exercise<00:00:28.750> down<00:00:28.930> into

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
I'll break the exercise down into

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.749 
I'll break the exercise down into
sections<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.189> can<00:00:30.310> work<00:00:30.430> on<00:00:30.550> what

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
sections so you can work on what

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.159 
sections so you can work on what
interests<00:00:31.119> you<00:00:31.270> whether<00:00:31.869> that<00:00:32.020> be

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
interests you whether that be

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.290 
interests you whether that be
specifically<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.800> left<00:00:32.980> or<00:00:33.130> right<00:00:33.160> hand<00:00:33.580> with

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
specifically the left or right hand with

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.410 
specifically the left or right hand with
or<00:00:34.390> without<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.750> thumping<00:00:35.020> technique<00:00:35.440> or

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
or without the thumping technique or

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600 
or without the thumping technique or
four<00:00:37.420> six<00:00:37.660> or<00:00:37.780> eight<00:00:37.960> strings<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:39.160> if<00:00:39.460> you're

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
four six or eight strings so if you're

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.299 
four six or eight strings so if you're
an<00:00:40.120> obsessive<00:00:40.300> person<00:00:40.780> like<00:00:40.900> myself<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:42.190> can

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
an obsessive person like myself you can

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.310 
an obsessive person like myself you can
learn<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.820> entire<00:00:43.090> thing<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.629> practice<00:00:44.199> it

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
here's exercise in full the exercise

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.870 
here's exercise in full the exercise
begins<00:01:10.780> with<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.740> left<00:01:11.950> hand<00:01:12.190> hammering<00:01:12.670> on

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
begins with the left hand hammering on

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.090 
begins with the left hand hammering on
an<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.149> major<00:01:13.390> nine<00:01:13.720> chord<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.289> then<00:01:14.920> that's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
an a major nine chord and then that's

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.219 
an a major nine chord and then that's
immediately<00:01:15.580> followed<00:01:15.940> by<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.990> glitch

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
immediately followed by the glitch

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.600 
immediately followed by the glitch
tapping<00:01:17.619> which<00:01:17.740> occurs<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.250> sixth<00:01:18.550> fret

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
tapping which occurs on the sixth fret

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.160 
tapping which occurs on the sixth fret
of<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.820> d-string<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.509> I'm<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.750> hammering

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
of the d-string and I'm just hammering

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.870 
of the d-string and I'm just hammering
on<00:01:20.289> with<00:01:20.649> my<00:01:20.770> ring<00:01:20.979> finger<00:01:21.009> my<00:01:21.430> middle<00:01:21.640> finger

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
on with my ring finger my middle finger

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.609 
on with my ring finger my middle finger
and<00:01:21.970> my<00:01:22.030> index<00:01:22.360> finger<00:01:22.659> quickly<00:01:23.439> and

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and my index finger quickly and

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.830 
and my index finger quickly and
percussively<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.299> best<00:01:25.479> way<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.780> I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
percussively so the best way that I

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.510 
percussively so the best way that I
found<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.110> practice<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.220> give<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.490> a

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
found to practice this is to give it a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.380 
found to practice this is to give it a
very<00:01:27.930> exaggerated<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.280> strength<00:01:30.670> you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
very exaggerated kind of strength you

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.940 
very exaggerated kind of strength you
just<00:01:31.570> want<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.049> ceiling<00:01:32.409> of<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.650> technique

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
just want the ceiling of the technique

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.050 
just want the ceiling of the technique
to<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.189> higher<00:01:33.340> than<00:01:33.549> what<00:01:33.729> you'll<00:01:33.970> actually

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
to be higher than what you'll actually

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.969 
to be higher than what you'll actually
need<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.990> I'll<00:01:35.110> just<00:01:35.290> slow<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:35.650> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
need so I'll just slow it down and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.980 
need so I'll just slow it down and
practice<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.490> very<00:01:36.729> intentionally<00:01:37.390> something

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
practice it very intentionally something

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.649 
practice it very intentionally something
like<00:01:38.140> this

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.200 

Hey

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.720 

you<00:01:47.210> could<00:01:47.300> also<00:01:47.450> use<00:01:47.810> adjacent<00:01:48.530> strings<00:01:48.800> to

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
you could also use adjacent strings to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.100 
you could also use adjacent strings to
develop<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.270> technique<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.810> gives<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.080> a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
develop the technique it gives you a

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.420 
develop the technique it gives you a
little<00:01:51.230> bit<00:01:51.380> more<00:01:51.530> space<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.130> then<00:01:52.280> some

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
little bit more space and then some

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.530 
little bit more space and then some
people<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.670> skip<00:01:52.940> strings<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.330> things<00:01:53.450> like

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
people will skip strings and things like

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.860 
people will skip strings and things like
that<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:54.110> this

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.830 

and<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:02.730> applications<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.510> this<00:02:03.660> type<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and the applications for this type of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.720 
and the applications for this type of
thing<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.380> tremendous<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.400> really<00:02:05.610> move

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
thing are tremendous you can really move

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.670 
thing are tremendous you can really move
it<00:02:05.880> around<00:02:05.940> have<00:02:06.870> different<00:02:07.170> chords<00:02:07.500> hammer

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it around have different chords hammer

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.170 
it around have different chords hammer
on<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.010> different<00:02:08.130> ways<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.760> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
on in different ways you want to get a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.880 
on in different ways you want to get a
really<00:02:09.450> solid<00:02:09.840> percussive<00:02:10.380> attack<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
really solid percussive attack for the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.020 
really solid percussive attack for the
left<00:02:11.070> hand<00:02:11.280> when<00:02:11.460> you're<00:02:11.580> hammering<00:02:11.820> on<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
left hand when you're hammering on a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:23.500 
left hand when you're hammering on a
chord<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> something<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.750 

the<00:02:24.510> second<00:02:24.900> section<00:02:25.049> begins<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the second section begins with the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.059 
the second section begins with the
glitch<00:02:26.970> tapping<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.659> left<00:02:27.840> hand<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.950> I'm

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
glitch tapping on the left hand and I'm

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.680 
glitch tapping on the left hand and I'm
hammering<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.760> middle<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.120> index<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
hammering on with my middle and index it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.229 
hammering on with my middle and index it
only<00:02:30.840> has<00:02:31.049> two<00:02:31.319> repetitions<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> note<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
only has two repetitions of the note and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.360 
only has two repetitions of the note and
then<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.659> followed<00:02:33.810> by<00:02:34.019> down<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.159> of<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
then it's followed by down up of the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.800 
then it's followed by down up of the
thumb<00:02:35.549> which<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.030> something<00:02:36.420> technique<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
thumb which is the something technique I

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.539 
thumb which is the something technique I
got<00:02:36.959> from<00:02:37.110> Victor<00:02:37.349> Wooten<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.099> it's<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.340> hammer

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
got from Victor Wooten so it's a hammer

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.280 
got from Victor Wooten so it's a hammer
on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.879> fifth<00:02:39.090> fret<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> b-string

the middle finger the index the down up
and<00:02:43.170> then<00:02:43.650> I'm<00:02:44.010> hitting<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.360> an<00:02:46.140> arpeggio<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and then I'm hitting the an arpeggio and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.170 
and then I'm hitting the an arpeggio and
it's<00:02:47.129> on<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> G<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.579> D<00:02:47.700> strings<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.120> I'm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's on the G and the D strings and I'm

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.890 
it's on the G and the D strings and I'm
hammering<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.540> those<00:02:48.750> notes<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.739> this

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

there's<00:02:57.900> some<00:02:58.019> cool<00:02:58.140> applications<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.799> this

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
there's some cool applications for this

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.530 
there's some cool applications for this
you<00:02:59.069> can<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.670> walk<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.060> arpeggios

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you can really walk these arpeggios

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.750 
you can really walk these arpeggios
around<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.140> sending<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:01.620> descending<00:03:02.069> in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
around a sending or descending in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.849 
around a sending or descending in
different<00:03:03.150> areas<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.230> mileage<00:03:04.620> can

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
different areas a lot of mileage can

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.790 
different areas a lot of mileage can
come<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.129> this<00:03:05.280> type<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> technique

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.740 

the<00:03:11.490> next<00:03:11.700> couple<00:03:11.940> parts<00:03:12.210> are<00:03:12.390> pretty<00:03:12.570> much

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the next couple parts are pretty much

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.600 
the next couple parts are pretty much
the<00:03:12.870> same<00:03:13.020> thing<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.320> what<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.740> did<00:03:14.100> except

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
the same thing as what I just did except

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.730 
the same thing as what I just did except
for<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:14.880> moved<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.330> minor<00:03:15.540> third<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
for it's moved up a minor third and the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.960 
for it's moved up a minor third and the
thumped<00:03:17.010> arpeggio<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.760> little

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
thumped arpeggio is just a little

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:28.550 
thumped arpeggio is just a little
different<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.540> last<00:03:27.780> section<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
different in this last section of the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.040 
different in this last section of the
exercise<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.340> began<00:03:29.850> by<00:03:30.030> using<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.600> glitch<00:03:30.780> tap

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
exercise I began by using the glitch tap

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.620 
exercise I began by using the glitch tap
on<00:03:31.260> my<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.830> hand<00:03:32.160> I'm<00:03:32.430> hammering<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
on my right hand I'm hammering on the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.780 
on my right hand I'm hammering on the
ring<00:03:34.050> middle<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.680> index<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:35.460> doing<00:03:35.610> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
ring middle and index and then doing a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.450 
ring middle and index and then doing a
slide<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.770> slide<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.220> be<00:03:38.310> pretty

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
slide so the slide can be pretty

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.160 
slide so the slide can be pretty
difficult<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:39.390> kind<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.600> an<00:03:39.720> example<00:03:39.990> of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
difficult it's kind of an example of

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.570 
difficult it's kind of an example of
what<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.500> can<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.770> once<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.070> develop<00:03:41.400> some

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
what you can do once you develop some

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.610 
what you can do once you develop some
strengths<00:03:41.880> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> technique<00:03:42.450> I'm<00:03:43.380> then

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
strengths with the technique I'm then

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.900 
strengths with the technique I'm then
I'm<00:03:43.740> hammering<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.190> an<00:03:44.340> E<00:03:44.460> major<00:03:44.640> nine<00:03:44.880> chord

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
I'm hammering on an E major nine chord

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.660 
I'm hammering on an E major nine chord
after<00:03:45.390> each<00:03:45.930> slide<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:47.280> I'm<00:03:47.400> doing<00:03:47.580> this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
after each slide and I'm doing this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.310 
after each slide and I'm doing this
slide<00:03:47.880> ascending<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> descending<00:03:48.750> on

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
slide ascending and descending on

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.710 
slide ascending and descending on
different<00:03:49.620> strings<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.820> then<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.000> hammer<00:03:51.240> on<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
different strings and then I hammer on a
