here on the other side the Jake brake
control<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:41.189> believe<00:03:42.189> this<00:03:42.310> thing<00:03:42.519> has<00:03:42.639> a

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
control I believe this thing has a

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.819 
control I believe this thing has a
common<00:03:43.269> Senate<00:03:43.750> probably<00:03:44.439> in<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.859> X<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.739> this

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
common Senate probably in is X so this

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.589 
common Senate probably in is X so this
enough<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.189> bus<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.639> very<00:03:48.849> new<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.090> me<00:03:49.359> it's

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
enough the bus is very new to me it's

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.290 
enough the bus is very new to me it's
first<00:03:49.810> time<00:03:50.079> I've<00:03:50.199> driven<00:03:50.349> it

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
of course the service brake in the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.780 
of course the service brake in the
throttle<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:55.140> switch<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.430> let<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
