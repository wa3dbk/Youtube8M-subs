00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
about um you can see here when I first

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.490 
about um you can see here when I first
got<00:01:27.850> these<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.890> initial<00:01:30.520> thoughts<00:01:30.880> were<00:01:31.500> dude

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
got these my initial thoughts were dude

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.370 
got these my initial thoughts were dude
these<00:01:33.070> are<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.370> carbon<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.940> got<00:01:34.180> gypped<00:01:34.540> but

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
these are not carbon I got gypped but

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.370 
these are not carbon I got gypped but
these<00:01:36.250> are<00:01:36.460> actually<00:01:36.910> carbon<00:01:37.390> fiber<00:01:37.750> now<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
these are actually carbon fiber now the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.900 
these are actually carbon fiber now the
reason<00:01:38.590> why<00:01:38.800> i<00:01:38.830> thought<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> microfiber<00:01:39.670> is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
reason why i thought the microfiber is

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.980 
reason why i thought the microfiber is
because<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.500> super<00:01:41.860> light<00:01:42.190> it's<00:01:42.460> under

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
because this is super light it's under

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.380 
because this is super light it's under
six<00:01:43.990> grams<00:01:44.320> for<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.010> carbon<00:01:45.490> fiber

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
six grams for this carbon fiber

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.050 
six grams for this carbon fiber

you<00:02:01.210> know<00:02:01.240> experience<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.229> this<00:02:02.320> look<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.620> the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
you know experience of this look at the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.800 
you know experience of this look at the
quality<00:02:02.950> it's<00:02:03.340> very<00:02:03.580> very<00:02:03.820> nice<00:02:04.060> very

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
quality it's very very nice very

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.430 
quality it's very very nice very
impressive<00:02:04.960> fit<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:06.970> here<00:02:07.440> very

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
impressive fit you can see here very

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.670 
impressive fit you can see here very
very<00:02:08.590> little<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.539> know<00:02:10.659> twist<00:02:11.260> when<00:02:11.590> I'm

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
very little to you know twist when I'm

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.739 
very little to you know twist when I'm
flexing<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.249> on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.609> torsion<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.299> also<00:02:13.599> when

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.749 
flexing it on the torsion and also when

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:14.410 
flexing it on the torsion and also when
I'm<00:02:13.840> moving

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'm moving

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.900 
I'm moving
apply<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.470> doesn't<00:02:15.800> flex<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.400> much<00:02:16.670> at

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
apply here it doesn't flex that much at

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.850 
apply here it doesn't flex that much at
all<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.360> that's<00:02:17.510> very<00:02:17.810> good<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.440> telling<00:02:18.739> you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
all so that's very good it's telling you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.400 
all so that's very good it's telling you
that<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.220> prop<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.970> stiff<00:02:20.450> enough<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:21.110> flying

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
that the prop is stiff enough for flying

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.820 
that the prop is stiff enough for flying
multi-rotor<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.250> providing<00:02:23.410> smooth<00:02:24.410> and

multi-rotor and providing smooth and
vibration<00:02:25.730> free<00:02:26.150> video<00:02:26.720> footage<00:02:26.989> now<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.319> have

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
vibration free video footage now I have

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.270 
vibration free video footage now I have
here<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.800> an<00:02:27.890> APC<00:02:28.630> 8<00:02:29.630> by<00:02:29.959> 4<00:02:30.470> inch<00:02:30.739> plastic

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
here is an APC 8 by 4 inch plastic

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.660 
here is an APC 8 by 4 inch plastic
propeller<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.890> flexes<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.069> lot

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
propeller you can see it flexes a lot

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.790 
propeller you can see it flexes a lot
when<00:02:35.239> you're<00:02:35.360> flying<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.260> all<00:02:36.530> of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
when you're flying it like so all of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
when you're flying it like so all of
them<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> hub<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.580> way<00:02:37.640> up<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.239> also

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
them the hub all the way up and also

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.290 
them the hub all the way up and also
it's<00:02:39.319> easily<00:02:39.890> able<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.610> be<00:02:40.730> able<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.030> twist

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
it's easily able to be able to twist

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.809 
it's easily able to be able to twist
right<00:02:41.569> here<00:02:41.810> on<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.440> side<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:43.730> you're

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
right here on this side so when you're

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.610 
right here on this side so when you're
flying<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.300> with<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.540> lot<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.780> load<00:02:45.080> or<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.500> it's

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
flying it with a lot of load or if it's

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.290 
flying it with a lot of load or if it's
windy<00:02:45.830> or<00:02:46.130> climbing<00:02:46.730> are<00:02:46.819> fine<00:02:47.150> too

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
windy or climbing are fine too

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.540 
windy or climbing are fine too
aggressive<00:02:47.780> these<00:02:48.470> prop<00:02:48.769> starts<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.220> flutter

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
aggressive these prop starts to flutter

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.270 
aggressive these prop starts to flutter
and<00:02:50.330> that's<00:02:51.110> not<00:02:51.290> good<00:02:51.620> because<00:02:51.830> many

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
and that's not good because many

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.070 
and that's not good because many
flutters<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.060> vibration<00:02:53.630> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.959> your

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
flutters that's vibration going to your

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.449 
flutters that's vibration going to your
camera<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.650> gives<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.860> bad<00:02:55.160> video

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
camera and it gives you bad video

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.479 
camera and it gives you bad video
footage<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.110> other<00:02:57.170> hand<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.680> really

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
footage this on the other hand is really

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.780 
footage this on the other hand is really
rigid<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.709> stiff<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.100> very<00:03:01.250> very<00:03:01.580> nice

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
rigid and stiff so it's very very nice

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.870 
rigid and stiff so it's very very nice
now<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.660> as<00:03:02.900> stiff<00:03:03.440> as<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.670> night

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
now it's not as stiff as the night

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.000 
now it's not as stiff as the night
before<00:03:05.090> inch<00:03:05.480> pot<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.019> here<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.920> you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
before inch pot that I have here but you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.009 
before inch pot that I have here but you
can<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.310> these<00:03:07.610> are<00:03:07.760> actually<00:03:08.060> super<00:03:08.780> stiff

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
can see these are actually super stiff

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.960 
can see these are actually super stiff
but<00:03:09.319> they're<00:03:09.500> super<00:03:09.830> heavy<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.370> when<00:03:10.910> you

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
but they're super heavy and when you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.430 
but they're super heavy and when you
have<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> heavy<00:03:11.330> prop<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> lot<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.170> mass

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
have a heavy prop you have a lot of mass

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.229 
have a heavy prop you have a lot of mass
that's<00:03:12.680> spinning<00:03:13.010> around<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.060> would<00:03:14.209> think

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
that's spinning around you would think

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.490 
that's spinning around you would think
that<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.870> know<00:03:14.959> when<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> lot<00:03:15.470> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that you know when you have a lot of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.410 
that you know when you have a lot of
mastering<00:03:15.950> around<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.400> stabilizes<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.060> crap

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
mastering around it stabilizes the crap

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.520 
mastering around it stabilizes the crap
really<00:03:17.630> well<00:03:18.730> kinda<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.880> gyro<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:21.230> it

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
really well kinda like a gyro but it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.259 
really well kinda like a gyro but it
doesn't<00:03:21.890> really<00:03:21.950> work<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.459> great<00:03:23.060> because

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
doesn't really work that great because

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.870 
doesn't really work that great because
you<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:23.989> much<00:03:24.109> mass<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.650> motor<00:03:24.859> has<00:03:25.070> to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
you have so much mass the motor has to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.460 
you have so much mass the motor has to
work<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.180> lot<00:03:26.359> harder<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.930> takes<00:03:27.109> longer

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
work a lot harder and it takes longer

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.310 
work a lot harder and it takes longer
and<00:03:27.680> slower<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.609> speed<00:03:28.880> up<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.239> spool<00:03:29.510> down<00:03:29.720> to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
and slower to speed up and spool down to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.780 
and slower to speed up and spool down to
keep<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.680> craft<00:03:30.950> stabilized<00:03:31.370> because<00:03:31.640> you

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
keep the craft stabilized because you

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.000 
keep the craft stabilized because you
know<00:03:31.940> your<00:03:32.660> craft<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.049> doing<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.829> then

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
know your craft is doing this and then

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.680 
know your craft is doing this and then
your<00:03:34.130> flight<00:03:34.280> controllers<00:03:34.700> telling<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.209> tell

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
your flight controllers telling you tell

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.479 
your flight controllers telling you tell
me<00:03:35.750> think<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.109> this<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.220> takes<00:03:37.400> longer

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
me think to do this so it takes longer

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.770 
me think to do this so it takes longer
and<00:03:37.790> everything<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:38.239> gets<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:38.540> bit

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
and everything just gets a little bit

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.900 
and everything just gets a little bit
wobbly<00:03:38.989> sometimes<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.010> that's<00:03:40.609> what<00:03:40.790> I'm

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
wobbly sometimes and that's what I'm

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.550 
wobbly sometimes and that's what I'm
assuming<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.870> can't<00:03:42.200> wait<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.320> try<00:03:42.500> these

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
assuming so I can't wait to try these

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.110 
assuming so I can't wait to try these
out<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:43.070> if<00:03:43.100> there's<00:03:43.340> any<00:03:43.489> difference<00:03:43.700> in

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
out to see if there's any difference in

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.490 
out to see if there's any difference in
the<00:03:44.299> flight<00:03:44.510> performance<00:03:44.660> which<00:03:45.230> I'm

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
the flight performance which I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.680 
the flight performance which I'm
assuming<00:03:45.739> there<00:03:46.310> will<00:03:46.459> be<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.700> little<00:03:47.000> bit<00:03:47.239> I'm

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
assuming there will be a little bit I'm

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.160 
assuming there will be a little bit I'm
not<00:03:47.930> looking<00:03:48.200> for<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> day<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.579> night

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
not looking for a day and night

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.660 
not looking for a day and night
difference<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:51.829> am<00:03:52.070> expecting<00:03:52.370> these<00:03:52.609> to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
difference but I am expecting these to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.789 
difference but I am expecting these to
be<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:52.940> slightly<00:03:53.390> better<00:03:53.600> quality<00:03:54.170> better<00:03:54.320> or

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
be a slightly better quality better or

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.420 
be a slightly better quality better or
more<00:03:55.400> stability<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.290> slightly<00:03:57.290> more<00:03:57.890> flight

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
more stability and slightly more flight

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.370 
more stability and slightly more flight
time<00:03:58.459> I'm<00:03:58.910> hoping<00:03:59.329> more<00:03:59.660> flight<00:03:59.930> time<00:03:59.959> because

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
time I'm hoping more flight time because

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.500 
time I'm hoping more flight time because
the<00:04:00.470> court<00:04:00.680> respects<00:04:01.069> these<00:04:01.670> props<00:04:02.030> put<00:04:02.390> out

90 bucks apiece so I thought these were

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.909 
90 bucks apiece so I thought these were
expensive<00:04:53.270> at<00:04:53.419> first<00:04:53.690> but<00:04:53.930> when<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.229> got<00:04:54.710> these
