so one of the cool things about the Jobi
tripod<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> said<00:00:39.450> before<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.960> can

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
tripod is like I said before you can

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.020 
tripod is like I said before you can
flex<00:00:40.350> each<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.040> parts<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.879> they

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
flex each one of these parts but they

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.970 
flex each one of these parts but they
actually<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.480> rubber<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.230> each<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> on

actually have rubber around each and on
the<00:00:44.100> feet<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.610> basically<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:45.480> you're

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the feet so basically when you're

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000

wrapping<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.050> around<00:00:46.079> something<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> grips

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
wrapping it around something it grips

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
wrapping it around something it grips

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
really really really well another one of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200 
really really really well another one of
the<00:00:49.530> features<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:51.059> can

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
particular model of the granola pod is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.549 
particular model of the granola pod is
59<00:00:58.109> 99<00:00:58.379> Canadian<00:00:59.129> which<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> bit<00:01:00.059> expensive

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
59 99 Canadian which is a bit expensive

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.810 
59 99 Canadian which is a bit expensive
the<00:01:01.559> reason<00:01:01.859> why<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> though

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the reason why I really like it though

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
the reason why I really like it though
is<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> bring<00:01:04.229> around

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
is because I don't like to bring around

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
is because I don't like to bring around
my<00:01:04.830> huge<00:01:05.129> tripod<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.420> you're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
though without a ball head or some sort

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
though without a ball head or some sort
of<00:01:14.369> tripod<00:01:14.820> head<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> top<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.750> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of tripod head on the top of this it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.289 
of tripod head on the top of this it's
kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> useless<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> put<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> over

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
kind of useless like if you put it over

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.420 
kind of useless like if you put it over
top<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.290> bar<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.560> something<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.220> works

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
top of a bar or something that works

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.679 
top of a bar or something that works
fine<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.210> you're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> wrap<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
fine but if you're going to wrap it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
fine but if you're going to wrap it
around<00:01:21.869> something<00:01:22.200> sideways<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.130> anything

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
around something sideways or anything

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
around something sideways or anything
that's<00:01:23.759> an<00:01:23.939> odd<00:01:24.150> shape<00:01:24.180> your<00:01:24.810> camera<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.200> going

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's an odd shape your camera is going

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
that's an odd shape your camera is going
to<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to be that way so what you do you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
to be that way so what you do you
actually<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.350> head<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.799> top

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
actually need to have a head on the top

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
actually need to have a head on the top
so<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> sideways<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so when you put it sideways you can

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.999 
so when you put it sideways you can
actually<00:01:30.780> turn<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> camera<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
actually turn the camera and get the
