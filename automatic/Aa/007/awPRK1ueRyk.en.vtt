on<00:01:10.030> his<00:01:10.630> website<00:01:10.840> today<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.350> notice<00:01:12.009> which<00:01:12.189> I'll

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
on his website today I notice which I'll

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.889 
on his website today I notice which I'll
be<00:01:12.429> buying<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:13.390> has<00:01:13.539> actually<00:01:13.869> a

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
be buying one that has actually a

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.039 
be buying one that has actually a
survival<00:01:14.530> pot<00:01:14.890> at<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.130> top<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:16.030> with<00:01:16.899> this

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
survival pot at the top so with this

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.899 
survival pot at the top so with this
model<00:01:17.530> here<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.859> can<00:01:18.009> see<00:01:18.130> if<00:01:18.219> I<00:01:18.310> pull<00:01:18.579> out<00:01:18.609> the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
model here you can see if I pull out the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.639 
model here you can see if I pull out the
piston<00:01:19.329> it<00:01:19.570> actually<00:01:19.960> has<00:01:20.049> suction<00:01:20.409> on<00:01:20.530> if<00:01:20.590> I

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
piston it actually has suction on if I

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.679 
piston it actually has suction on if I
let<00:01:20.770> go<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.039> snaps<00:01:21.280> back<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.759> because<00:01:22.450> there's

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
let go it snaps back in because there's

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.450 
let go it snaps back in because there's
a<00:01:22.749> suction<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.499> pressure<00:01:23.799> in<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.039> chamber

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
a suction and pressure in that chamber

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.999 
a suction and pressure in that chamber
so<00:01:25.149> this<00:01:25.689> you<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:25.990> loosen<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.469> bottom<00:01:26.619> cap<00:01:26.979> a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
so this you just loosen the bottom cap a

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.410 
so this you just loosen the bottom cap a
little<00:01:27.130> bit<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.789> releases<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.299> pressure

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
little bit that releases the pressure

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
little bit that releases the pressure
and<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.840> can<00:01:28.869> pull<00:01:29.109> your<00:01:29.229> piston<00:01:29.619> out

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and you can pull your piston out

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
and you can pull your piston out
retighten<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:30.999> bottle<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:32.259> now<00:01:32.469> we<00:01:32.530> have

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
retighten that bottle and now we have

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.739 
retighten that bottle and now we have
our<00:01:32.920> piston<00:01:33.340> with<00:01:33.490> our<00:01:33.609> own<00:01:33.850> ring<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.359> keep<00:01:34.509> the

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
our piston with our own ring to keep the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.349 
our piston with our own ring to keep the
air<00:01:34.990> from<00:01:35.350> escaping<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.759> when<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:36.999> put<00:01:37.240> this

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
air from escaping and when you put this

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.539 
air from escaping and when you put this
in<00:01:37.689> with<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.929> piece<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.200> char<00:01:38.950> cloth<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.429> that

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
in with a piece of char cloth in that

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.340 
in with a piece of char cloth in that
chamber<00:01:39.969> or<00:01:40.210> any<00:01:40.329> other<00:01:40.539> combustible<00:01:41.109> piece

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350

chamber or any other combustible piece
of<00:01:41.530> material<00:01:41.969> when<00:01:42.969> you<00:01:42.999> force<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.600> down<00:01:43.810> in

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
of material when you force this down in

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.050 
of material when you force this down in
that<00:01:44.079> chamber<00:01:44.499> and<00:01:44.649> no<00:01:44.740> air<00:01:44.920> can<00:01:45.280> escape<00:01:45.310> like

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
that chamber and no air can escape like

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.550 
that chamber and no air can escape like
our<00:01:46.210> diesel<00:01:46.420> engine<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:46.929> creates<00:01:47.409> that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
our diesel engine that creates that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.830 
our diesel engine that creates that
combustion<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.280> air<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.729> creates<00:01:49.359> that<00:01:49.569> heat

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
hopefully you'll be able to see that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.520 
hopefully you'll be able to see that
when<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.190> ignite<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:10.000> I'll<00:02:10.899> pick<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.170> out<00:02:11.380> with

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
when I ignite and I'll pick it out with

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
when I ignite and I'll pick it out with
my<00:02:11.709> knife<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.250> place<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.819> into<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.000> tinder

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
my knife and place it into the tinder

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.810 
my knife and place it into the tinder
nest<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.200> humidity<00:02:14.770> today<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.160> waffle<00:02:15.640> high

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
nest the humidity today is waffle high

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.850 
nest the humidity today is waffle high
so<00:02:16.540> hopefully<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.140> tinder<00:02:17.410> nests<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.710> get

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
so hopefully the tinder nests will get

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.340 
so hopefully the tinder nests will get
going<00:02:18.100> for

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
going for

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.260 
going for
to<00:02:18.530> see<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:18.800> create<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> fire<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:20.060> again

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
to see we can create a fire but again

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.600 
to see we can create a fire but again
this<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.630> fire<00:02:21.110> piston<00:02:21.470> by<00:02:21.590> Tara<00:02:21.890> light<00:02:22.070> so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
this is a fire piston by Tara light so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.130 
this is a fire piston by Tara light so
again<00:02:22.820> I've<00:02:22.970> tightened<00:02:23.300> up<00:02:23.390> my<00:02:23.540> bottom<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:24.110> I

humidity hopefully be able to get a fire
going<00:03:28.910> pretty<00:03:29.120> easily<00:03:29.360> with<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:31.690> now<00:03:32.690> we

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
going pretty easily with this now we

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.450 
going pretty easily with this now we
just<00:03:33.020> do<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.290> as<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:33.770> any<00:03:33.890> other<00:03:34.960> fire
