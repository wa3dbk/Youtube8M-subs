00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
as you can see it's got all the score

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.270

the<00:00:43.190> background<00:00:44.190> stuff<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:45.030> miss<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
the background stuff i miss that the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
the background stuff i miss that the
environment<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.420> clearly<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.809> image

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
environment so this is clearly a image

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.740 
environment so this is clearly a image
from<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> game<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:50.789> me<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> looks<00:00:51.360> count<00:00:51.600> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
from the game to me it looks count on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.090 
from the game to me it looks count on
finished<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:54.020> people<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.140> saying<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.980> this

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
finished so people are saying that this

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
finished so people are saying that this
is<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.809> canvas<00:00:57.809> appointing<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is like canvas appointing because the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.170 
is like canvas appointing because the
lighting<00:00:59.039> isn't<00:00:59.340> love<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
lighting isn't love right and all that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
lighting isn't love right and all that
stuff<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
stuff but i think this is not this is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
stuff but i think this is not this is
not<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.340> finished<00:01:02.699> product<00:01:03.019> like<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
not a finished product like this that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
not a finished product like this that
the<00:01:04.619> screenshot<00:01:05.070> isn't<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.549> from<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> finished

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the screenshot isn't a from the finished

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.770 
the screenshot isn't a from the finished
product<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> lighting<00:01:09.210> hasn't<00:01:09.540> clearly

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
product so the lighting hasn't clearly

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320 
product so the lighting hasn't clearly
been<00:01:09.900> implemented<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> percent<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:12.000> yet

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
been implemented and a percent right yet

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.560 
been implemented and a percent right yet
and<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.640> looks<00:01:14.880> too<00:01:14.939> bright<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and like it just looks too bright and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
and like it just looks too bright and
that's<00:01:16.110> whether<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.310> just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's whether or not if if it's just

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
that's whether or not if if it's just
the<00:01:18.380> screenshots<00:01:19.380> too<00:01:19.650> bright<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.700> scan

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the screenshots too bright or the scan

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
the screenshots too bright or the scan
of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> actual<00:01:21.780> photo<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> magazines

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of the actual photo from the magazines

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
of the actual photo from the magazines
too<00:01:23.070> bright<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.990> purely

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
too bright but that's just purely

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
too bright but that's just purely
speculation<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
speculation but as you can see all the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.440 
speculation but as you can see all the
models<00:01:28.140> look<00:01:28.229> great<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> mean<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.939> mine<00:01:30.180> looks

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
models look great I mean the mine looks

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
models look great I mean the mine looks
a<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.810> different<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> home<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.670> Abe's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

new and tasty back in September and you
can<00:01:59.460> clearly<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> isn't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
can clearly see this is this this isn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.490 
can clearly see this is this this isn't
as<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.540> vols<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.320> more

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
as good as that so the vols you had more

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
as good as that so the vols you had more
work<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.009> rupture<00:02:05.399> farms<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:05.969> they've<00:02:06.090> had

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
work on rupture farms than they've had

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.570 
work on rupture farms than they've had
on<00:02:06.320> scrappy<00:02:07.320> Nia<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.280> opinion<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
on scrappy Nia that's my opinion and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.270 
on scrappy Nia that's my opinion and
again<00:02:11.330> that's<00:02:12.290> what<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.860> whether<00:02:13.100> or<00:02:13.190> not

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
again that's what this whether or not

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.190 
again that's what this whether or not
this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.460> like<00:02:13.640> an<00:02:13.730> early<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.390> game<00:02:14.630> screenshot

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
this is like an early in game screenshot

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.270 
this is like an early in game screenshot
that<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.680> might<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:15.980> been<00:02:16.010> before

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
that and that might have been before

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.590 
that and that might have been before
even<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:17.000> trailer<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.570> we<00:02:17.690> saw<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:19.600> we

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
even that trailer that we saw but we

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.560 
even that trailer that we saw but we
don't<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.260> need<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.530> find<00:02:21.770> out<00:02:21.890> more<00:02:22.570> III

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
don't know we need to find out more III

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.560 
don't know we need to find out more III
will<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.930> preferable<00:02:25.390> hopefully<00:02:26.390> we'll<00:02:26.540> see

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
will be preferable hopefully we'll see

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.990 
will be preferable hopefully we'll see
some<00:02:26.750> actual<00:02:27.710> footage<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.220> sky<00:02:28.520> be<00:02:28.640> Nia<00:02:28.850> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
some actual footage of sky be Nia and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
pomona and even more other things so we

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.970 
pomona and even more other things so we
can<00:02:32.090> compare<00:02:32.450> compare<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.830> actual

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
can compare compare that to the actual

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.950 
can compare compare that to the actual
screen<00:02:34.340> shot<00:02:34.610> anyway<00:02:35.330> that's<00:02:35.540> enough<00:02:35.780> of

screen shot anyway that's enough of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.540 
screen shot anyway that's enough of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
that's just me but it couldn't it could

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.400 
that's just me but it couldn't it could
be<00:03:37.130> released<00:03:37.459> on<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.300> set<00:03:38.630> time<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.080> so

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
be released on the set time it is so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.240 
be released on the set time it is so
well<00:03:39.769> if<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:41.000> delayed<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.260> great<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:43.070> my

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
well if it is delayed that's great in my

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.820 
well if it is delayed that's great in my
opinion<00:03:43.430> because<00:03:43.700> that's<00:03:44.230> more<00:03:45.230> time<00:03:45.410> spent

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
opinion because that's more time spent

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.380 
opinion because that's more time spent
making<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.030> game<00:03:48.010> right<00:03:49.010> then<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.060> that's<00:03:50.209> me
