00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 all right 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 good 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 what is the body organ more 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.279
 interesting most wonderful we have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.790
 where is it we have it here in the brain 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.830
 the brain has 100,000 million 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.189
 neurons and those neurons are 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 connected together to generate the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.500
 greater complexity of known matter in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.840
 the universe and also as it changes and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 is learning does not age like the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 other organs but can develop 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.610
 new faculties at times that others 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.739
 organs are already on their decline the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 brain is our most precious organ 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.160
 but what happens is that it does not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.980
 we pay enough attention 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.489
 because because until very recently with 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.800
 this formidable ability to process 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.230
 data that we had there from memory we 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.570
 we handled very well in life but at 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.240
 get the new processors and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.770
 connect with each other and the speed that 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.200
 they have all the processors now 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.140
 We are starting to notice some 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 limitations in our brain so in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 the latest accenture survey 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 in 30 countries with three thousand and one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.820
 workers and company managers are 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 I saw that 50 percent of the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.840
 executives his main problem was 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.910
 manage excess information and 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.820
 manage information technologies 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.000
 and communication 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.210
 to alleviate this, what some people do is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.160
 use multitasking and other tricks 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 they do one thing but they are lending 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.260
 attention to another the result of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.890
 practicing multitasking is that our 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.220
 listening decreases our low attention 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 and the ability to connect with others 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.200
 people are diminished 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 also our attention is being 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 reducing a lot and we are creating as 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.610
 some superficial brains and every time 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.819
 it costs us more to concentrate on things the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.209
 result is greater fatigue and a 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.430
 less satisfaction with what we do to 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.819
 the time the consumption of psychotropic drugs is 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.500
 growing anxiolytic antidepressants 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.300
 hypnotic and we are in a situation 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.489
 that almost one in six people 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.819
 is consuming some type of drug 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.299
 these 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.299
 what can we do good we know that for 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.480
 have a healthy and beautiful body we can 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.430
 exercise or have health habits 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.280
 eat in a way to drink more water 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.010
 etcetera etcetera we do not have to apply 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.170
 these same habits of health to the mind 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.040
 so that our mind is a mind 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.840
 beautiful an effective mind a healthy mind 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.359
 as we do it thanks to the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.189
 discoveries of neuroscience now 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.950
 we know that the brain is neuro plastic 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.200
 and that is generating new connections and 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.169
 we can see that there are trainings that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.239
 have an effect on developing new 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.790
 competitions one of these trainings 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.150
 it's called mindfulness that comes from 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 ancient contemplative practices 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.000
 mindfulness in Spanish what 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.609
 we could translate as consciousness 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.609
 full or conscious attention and you have to 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.959
 see with the ability to pay attention 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:26.900
 things deliberately noticing 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.360
 the changes that are occurring in 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.090
 that one is paying attention 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.670
 leaving aside distractions or 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.650
 judgments that are arising us 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.570
 we cultivate mindfulness when we are in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.800
 a conversation fully attentive to what 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.020
 that says to the other person without 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.020
 interrupt her and lending her all 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.760
 our attention on the other side when 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.920
 We work with automatic pilot or 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.080
 we do multitasking then we have the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.980
 divided attention and our efficiency 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.500
 low and our connection also gets worse 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.970
 when people train this that 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 we call mindfulness in a way 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.650
 deliberate just like when you go to a 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.220
 gym put on for 8 or 10 weeks 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.440
 with workouts of 30 to 45 minutes at 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.629
 day as in the jobs we have done 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.140
 with primary care doctors 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:18.470
 We see increases empathy and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.440
 connection with patients increases their 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.949
 emotional management and therefore its 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.770
 activity and decreases its fatigue 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:31.070
 reduces stress and also generate 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.320
 behaviors of greater care and being more 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.610
 professionals who in the end is what 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.880
 we all need and this because it happens 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.310
 because people start to have more 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.580
 clear the intention with what the 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.830
 things and to have clear intention go 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.320
 paying more attention to what they do 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.650
 moment to moment that ability to 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.080
 Paying sustained attention connects us 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.569
 more with the tasks with people with 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.020
 the as with communications for 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:06.979
 and allow us to stay focused 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.959
 for more time without affecting us 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.389
 the distractions or other things that 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.569
 the result of that is happening 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:18.289
 It also leads to behavior 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:22.639
 more balanced more ethical or better 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.099
 ability to reconcile work and life 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.599
 staff and in the end leads to greater 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:31.870
 health therefore we have to start 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.160
 take us seriously 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.500
 training of the mind to be able 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.140
 live in a world where there are so many 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.360
 processors are connected and is and 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.729
 there is so much information moving to this 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.279
 speed 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.729
 if we are not going to have more and more 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.819
 problems 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.029
 in the practice of mindfulness at the end 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.249
 it is beginning to be used in companies 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:57.229
 in hospitals and people are 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.809
 beginning to integrate in a way 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.900
 varied but the result is that it affects 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:06.110
 in the end to his happiness because when 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.270
 we have a healthy mind and we can be 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.089
 effective at work we are also more 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.610
 happy and that could be a good 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.099
 motivation to take this practice in 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.710
 serious mindfulness would also be to live 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.279
 with the spirit of the poem sing is of 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.800
 antonio machado who says well walker 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:26.839
 your footprints are the path and nothing else 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.569
 walker there is no road is made way 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:31.969
 When we walk, we walk and walk 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.460
 look back you see the path that 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.289
 never have to walk again 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.289
 there is no road but steles in the sea
