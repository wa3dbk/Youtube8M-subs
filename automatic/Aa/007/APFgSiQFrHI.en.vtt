00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
a link is always tends to be late almost

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.790 
a link is always tends to be late almost
halfway<00:01:09.850> around<00:01:10.150> before<00:01:10.840> you<00:01:11.020> can<00:01:11.320> get<00:01:11.500> into

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
halfway around before you can get into

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.340 
halfway around before you can get into
your<00:01:11.890> passe<00:01:12.340> turn<00:01:12.670> right<00:01:13.360> before<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.870> you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
your passe turn right before the you

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.640 
your passe turn right before the you
reach<00:01:14.620> the<00:01:14.830> position<00:01:15.010> of<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.910> passe<00:01:16.360> so<00:01:17.140> by

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
reach the position of the passe so by

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.490 
reach the position of the passe so by
thinking<00:01:17.710> back<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.060> position<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.780> can

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
thinking back to the position you can

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.880 
thinking back to the position you can
get<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.010> position<00:01:21.600> fast<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.080> then<00:01:23.740> we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
get to that position fast and then we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.340 
get to that position fast and then we
actually<00:01:24.250> see<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> term<00:01:24.910> happen<00:01:25.540> in<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
actually see the term happen in the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.980 
actually see the term happen in the
whole<00:01:26.620> way<00:01:26.800> around<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.310> opposed<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.090> getting

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
whole way around as opposed to getting

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.230 
whole way around as opposed to getting
almost<00:01:29.290> around<00:01:29.770> by<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.730> position<00:01:30.760> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
almost around by a is in position and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.640 
almost around by a is in position and
then<00:01:31.480> it's<00:01:31.600> just<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.840> quarter<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.410> term

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
then it's just a quarter of the term

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.120 
then it's just a quarter of the term
right<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:35.170> do<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.320> think<00:01:35.530> fast<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.100> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
right so what do you think fast of the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
right so what do you think fast of the
position<00:01:36.670> it's<00:01:37.030> about<00:01:37.300> getting<00:01:37.570> them<00:01:37.870> leg

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
position it's about getting them leg

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.300 
position it's about getting them leg
