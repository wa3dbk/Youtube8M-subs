you<00:01:14.490> travel<00:01:15.149> from<00:01:15.330> star<00:01:15.630> system<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> star

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you travel from star system to star

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
you travel from star system to star
system<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.160> it<00:01:17.250> takes<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> certain<00:01:17.820> number

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

days<00:01:18.690> or<00:01:19.550> years<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.160> destination

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you to travel there and so here you can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
you to travel there and so here you can
see<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.710> were<00:01:46.829> viewing<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.430> information

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
see we were viewing some information

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.340 
see we were viewing some information
about<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:49.380> particular<00:01:50.270> star<00:01:51.270> system<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.110> then

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
about a particular star system and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
about a particular star system and then
we're<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:52.860> travel<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
we're going to actually travel there and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
we're going to actually travel there and
you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.540> our<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.840> ship<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.470> flying<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can see our little ship is flying to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.230 
you can see our little ship is flying to
the<00:01:56.820> next<00:01:57.060> star<00:01:57.270> system<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.030> when

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the next star system and and then when

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.749 
the next star system and and then when
you<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:01.040> depending<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.070> what's<00:02:02.520> at

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you get there depending on what's at

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.289 
you get there depending on what's at
that<00:02:03.030> location<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.259> various<00:02:05.299> things

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299

just<00:02:25.189> kind<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.430> depends<00:02:25.849> on<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:27.489> your

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
just kind of depends on how that your

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.530 
just kind of depends on how that your
put<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:28.700> current<00:02:29.360> game<00:02:30.140> generated<00:02:31.540> those

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
particular star systems it's kind of a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.300 
particular star systems it's kind of a
an<00:02:37.760> interesting<00:02:38.629> game<00:02:38.900> because<00:02:39.799> like<00:02:40.099> here

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
an interesting game because like here

an interesting game because like here
you<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.700> see<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:42.069> traveled<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:44.299> a<00:02:44.329> planet<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
you just see I traveled to a planet and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.899 
you just see I traveled to a planet and
i<00:02:45.349> believe<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.280> star<00:02:46.760> exploded<00:02:47.439> so<00:02:48.879> right<00:02:49.879> now

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
i believe the star exploded so right now

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.000 
i believe the star exploded so right now
i<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.109> process<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.560> getting<00:02:51.769> away

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
i was in the process of getting away

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.240 
i was in the process of getting away
from<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.459> planet<00:02:53.079> I'm<00:02:54.079> I<00:02:54.319> travel<00:02:54.859> to<00:02:54.980> another

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
from that planet I'm I travel to another

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490 
from that planet I'm I travel to another
planet<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.299> stars<00:02:56.659> currently

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
planet and so that stars currently

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.699 
planet and so that stars currently

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.390 
expanding but yet i'm over at another
star<00:03:01.040> system<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:03.530> i'm<00:03:03.650> finding<00:03:04.159> some

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
star system and here i'm finding some

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.869

your<00:03:43.730> game<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.090> over<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.739> objective

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
your game is over so that the objective

your game is over so that the objective
of<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.489> game<00:03:49.519> really<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.780> fly<00:03:50.989> around<00:03:51.169> all

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
of the game really is to fly around all

of the game really is to fly around all
these<00:03:51.590> star<00:03:51.859> systems<00:03:52.569> stay<00:03:53.569> alive<00:03:54.250> collect<00:03:55.250> as

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
these star systems stay alive collect as

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.970 
these star systems stay alive collect as
much<00:03:55.609> stuff<00:03:55.940> as<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.239> can<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:56.989> return

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
much stuff as you can and then return

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
home before you run out of days so you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.030 
home before you run out of days so you
usually<00:04:02.750> have<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.109> home<00:04:03.349> planet<00:04:03.829> that<00:04:03.949> you

and leave the game and basically you you

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.970 
and leave the game and basically you you
end<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.800> with<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:24.040> bubble<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.490> course<00:04:25.680> if<00:04:26.680> you

fairly<00:05:06.430> quickly<00:05:08.460> here<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.610> can<00:05:09.820> see<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.450> got

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
fairly quickly here you can see I got

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.330 
fairly quickly here you can see I got
three<00:05:11.820> ships

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
three ships

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.749 
three ships
this<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.520> custom<00:05:16.289> simulation<00:05:17.610> kind<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.639> like

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
this is a custom simulation kind of like

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.670 
this is a custom simulation kind of like
a<00:05:18.789> practice<00:05:19.360> mode<00:05:20.129> for<00:05:21.129> combat<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.819> we<00:05:21.970> get

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
a practice mode for combat that we get

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.980 
a practice mode for combat that we get
selected<00:05:23.680> three<00:05:24.039> ships<00:05:24.370> for<00:05:25.060> my<00:05:25.240> team<00:05:25.569> just

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
selected three ships for my team just

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.200 
selected three ships for my team just
tuning<00:05:26.470> ships<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.250> kind<00:05:27.550> of<00:05:27.610> get<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.539> feel<00:05:28.900> for

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
tuning ships to kind of get a feel for

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.869 
tuning ships to kind of get a feel for
how<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.270> do<00:05:31.449> the<00:05:31.569> combat<00:05:32.080> in<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.349> game<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:33.250> so

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
how to do the combat in the game and so

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.850 
how to do the combat in the game and so
it's<00:05:34.030> kind<00:05:34.240> of<00:05:34.300> that<00:05:34.780> they<00:05:34.960> they<00:05:35.409> have<00:05:35.620> this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
it's kind of that they they have this

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.950 
it's kind of that they they have this
kind<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.129> features<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.819> you<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:37.389> put<00:05:37.659> in<00:05:37.810> all

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
kind of features and you can put in all

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.520 
kind of features and you can put in all
kinds<00:05:38.289> of<00:05:38.349> ships<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.330> hit<00:05:40.330> different<00:05:41.169> races
