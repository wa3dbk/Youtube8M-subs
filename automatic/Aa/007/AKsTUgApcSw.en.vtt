their go up four percent they split the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
their go up four percent they split the
pot<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
pot so that's what I like about it is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
pot so that's what I like about it is
not<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.270> whoever<00:01:18.570> loses<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.290> most

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
not like you know whoever loses the most

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
not like you know whoever loses the most
gives<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.310> money<00:01:20.549> everybody<00:01:21.420> who<00:01:21.720> meets

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
gives all the money everybody who meets

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
gives all the money everybody who meets
there<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.710> four<00:01:22.979> percent<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.060> they

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
there go up four percent you know they

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
there go up four percent you know they
all<00:01:24.540> split<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> pot<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.799> just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
all split the pot so I think it's just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.770 
all split the pot so I think it's just
like<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.490> fun<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> lose<00:01:27.299> weight<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
like a really fun way to lose weight the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.450 
like a really fun way to lose weight the
goal<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.380> manageable<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.130> mean<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
goal is pretty manageable I mean it's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.390 
goal is pretty manageable I mean it's
only<00:01:29.610> 4%<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.600> four<00:01:30.930> weeks<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.920> example<00:01:32.340> if

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
only 4% in four weeks so for example if

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
only 4% in four weeks so for example if
you're<00:01:32.549> 200<00:01:33.060> pounds<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.570> would<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> lose

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you're 200 pounds you would have to lose

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
you're 200 pounds you would have to lose
two<00:01:34.590> pounds<00:01:34.829> every<00:01:35.189> week<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> next<00:01:36.090> four

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
two pounds every week for the next four

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
two pounds every week for the next four

me to reach my desired weight for my

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.780 
me to reach my desired weight for my
wedding<00:02:25.200> day<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.530> anybody<00:02:26.010> else<00:02:26.310> who<00:02:26.610> wants

to<00:02:26.970> lose<00:02:27.180> weight<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
to lose weight I just think that it's a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
to lose weight I just think that it's a
great<00:02:29.010> incentive<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.180> great<00:02:30.390> way<00:02:30.570> for

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
great incentive and it's a great way for

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.870 
great incentive and it's a great way for
