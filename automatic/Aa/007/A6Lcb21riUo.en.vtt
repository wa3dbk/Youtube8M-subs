ground<00:04:03.900> floor<00:04:04.079> literally<00:04:04.859> has<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.220> come

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
ground floor literally has to come

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.680 
ground floor literally has to come
around<00:04:05.549> one<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.730> these<00:04:05.880> corners<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.450> get

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
around one of these corners and get

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
around one of these corners and get
right<00:04:07.019> up<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.410> spawn<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.069> unless<00:04:08.489> you're

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
right up on the spawn and unless you're

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.339 
right up on the spawn and unless you're
directly<00:04:09.150> below<00:04:09.389> where<00:04:09.690> I'm<00:04:09.810> laying<00:04:10.109> right

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
directly below where I'm laying right

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.039 
directly below where I'm laying right
now<00:04:10.549> it's<00:04:11.549> pretty<00:04:11.790> much<00:04:11.880> impossible<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.930> go

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
now it's pretty much impossible to go

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.449 
now it's pretty much impossible to go
ahead<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.440> pick<00:04:13.590> up<00:04:13.739> kills<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.280> get

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
ahead and pick up kills because you get

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.849 
ahead and pick up kills because you get
any<00:04:14.609> bit<00:04:14.849> closer<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.840> flag<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.440> you

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
any bit closer to that see flag and you

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.949 
any bit closer to that see flag and you
start<00:04:17.099> flipping<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:18.479> know<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.660> keep<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
start flipping it so you know to keep a

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.750 
start flipping it so you know to keep a
comfortable<00:04:19.410> spawn<00:04:19.919> trap<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.340> really<00:04:20.609> really

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
comfortable spawn trap it really really

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.069 
comfortable spawn trap it really really
comes<00:04:20.970> down<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.209> who<00:04:21.450> you're<00:04:21.599> playing<00:04:21.810> with

and what you know that's why I don't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.190

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
experience I'm used as pawns flipping

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.460 
experience I'm used as pawns flipping
and<00:04:36.120> that's<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.660> one<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> downfalls<00:04:37.170> of

and that's just one of the downfalls of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.720 
and that's just one of the downfalls of
playing<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:37.740> people<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.160> don't<00:04:38.190> know<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.490> I

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
playing with people you don't know but I

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.610 
playing with people you don't know but I
think<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.270> was<00:04:39.390> playing<00:04:39.660> with<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:40.530> girls

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
think I was playing with the girls

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.720 
think I was playing with the girls
playing<00:04:40.830> with<00:04:40.890> subscribers<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.610> and

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
playing with subscribers in this and

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.980 
playing with subscribers in this and
they<00:04:41.790> were<00:04:41.880> still<00:04:42.060> flipping<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.480> spawns<00:04:42.750> and

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
they were still flipping the spawns and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.360 
they were still flipping the spawns and
I<00:04:43.200> don't<00:04:43.680> know<00:04:43.770> if<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:43.980> was<00:04:44.100> like<00:04:44.220> they<00:04:44.340> were

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
I don't know if it was like they were

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.860 
I don't know if it was like they were
eager<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.730> try<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.240> prove<00:04:45.420> that<00:04:45.480> they're

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
eager to try to prove that they're

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
this in like five seconds and there's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.270 
this in like five seconds and there's
nothing<00:05:12.810> i<00:05:13.050> can<00:05:13.080> do<00:05:13.320> about<00:05:13.350> that<00:05:13.590> i<00:05:13.740> try<00:05:14.220> to

so slow I'm sometimes behind a little

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.920 
so slow I'm sometimes behind a little
bit<00:05:23.910> okay<00:05:24.150> I've<00:05:24.270> got<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.450> little<00:05:24.600> bit<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:24.840> a

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
bit okay I've got a little bit of a

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.900 
bit okay I've got a little bit of a
delay<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.410> little<00:05:25.770> bit<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.040> little<00:05:26.670> bit<00:05:26.760> of<00:05:26.820> a

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
delay a little bit of a little bit of a

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240 
delay a little bit of a little bit of a
lag<00:05:27.570> so<00:05:28.050> that's<00:05:28.290> what<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.470> comes<00:05:28.620> down<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.100> when

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250
