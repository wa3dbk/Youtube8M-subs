00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
fighting it it does feel like it really
feels<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.780> everyone<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.740> there

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
feels like so you can everyone out there

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
feels like so you can everyone out there
was<00:01:44.130> smashing<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> ball<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.000> quite<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> lot<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
was smashing a ball with quite a lot of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.139 
was smashing a ball with quite a lot of
ease<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.990> was<00:01:46.470> firing<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
ease and it was firing it was like so I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
ease and it was firing it was like so I
think<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:49.259> gonna<00:01:49.470> fire<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> World<00:01:50.640> Cup<00:01:50.790> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
think it's gonna fire at the World Cup I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
think it's gonna fire at the World Cup I
think<00:01:51.090> it'll<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.329> great<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.720> free<00:01:51.899> kicks<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
think it'll be great for free kicks and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.980 
think it'll be great for free kicks and
that's<00:01:52.680> only<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.460> door<00:01:53.670> Kelly<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.750> ball

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's only good door Kelly if the ball

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
that's only good door Kelly if the ball
comes<00:01:55.020> dying<00:01:55.560> richer<00:01:55.920> Yankee<00:01:56.280> does<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> ball

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
comes dying richer Yankee does the ball

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
comes dying richer Yankee does the ball
come<00:01:57.270> dying<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.770> gonna<00:01:58.979> see

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

balls<00:01:59.490> flying<00:01:59.729> under<00:02:00.000> rosette<00:02:00.680> there<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
balls flying under rosette there was a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.609 
balls flying under rosette there was a
couple<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> passes<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:03.409> weren't<00:02:04.409> coming

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
couple of passes they weren't coming

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.300 
couple of passes they weren't coming
down<00:02:04.860> em<00:02:05.210> no<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.649> what

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
down em no I think you know it was what

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.949 
down em no I think you know it was what
once<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> put<00:02:08.819> your<00:02:09.060> sort<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> wanted

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
once you put your sort of way you wanted

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
once you put your sort of way you wanted
it<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.200> pass<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.619> was<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.129> sort<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.430> going

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it to pass it was it was sort of going

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.059 
it to pass it was it was sort of going
where<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> wanted<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
where you wanted it

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.500 
where you wanted it
yeah<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> think<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.329> lot<00:02:14.480> of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
yeah I think you can get a lot of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.059 
yeah I think you can get a lot of
control<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.110> book<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.590> play<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
control on the book do you play with a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.059 
control on the book do you play with a
different<00:02:16.489> football<00:02:16.879> obviously<00:02:17.629> we<00:02:18.140> can<00:02:18.349> we

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
different football obviously we can we

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.240 
different football obviously we can we
go<00:02:20.230> would<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.319> be<00:02:21.439> happy<00:02:21.769> if<00:02:21.859> this<00:02:21.980> was<00:02:22.159> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
go would you be happy if this was the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.619 
go would you be happy if this was the
ball<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.519> were<00:02:22.609> playing<00:02:22.849> with<00:02:22.909> ritual<00:02:23.329> Yankee

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
ball you were playing with ritual Yankee

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.080 
ball you were playing with ritual Yankee
this<00:02:23.900> weekend<00:02:24.319> yeah<00:02:25.159> yeah<00:02:25.430> definitely<00:02:25.700> I

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
this weekend yeah yeah definitely I

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.940 
this weekend yeah yeah definitely I
don't<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.349> that's<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.620> thing<00:02:27.799> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
don't think I think that's the thing is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
don't think I think that's the thing is
once<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.609> get<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.849> period<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.269> time<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.629> train

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
once you get a period of time to train

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.839 
once you get a period of time to train
with<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.079> then<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.040> know<00:02:31.159> you<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.430> used<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.790> a

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
with it then you know you get used to a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.520 
with it then you know you get used to a
football<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.629> I<00:02:32.659> think<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.500> is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
football so I think that's what it is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.920 
football so I think that's what it is
every<00:02:33.890> team<00:02:34.099> well<00:02:34.340> obviously<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:35.629> know<00:02:35.750> once

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
every team well obviously you know once

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.030 
every team well obviously you know once
thing<00:02:36.109> on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.319> thing<00:02:36.349> goes<00:02:36.620> out<00:02:36.829> there

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
thing on the thing goes out there

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.500 
thing on the thing goes out there
they'll<00:02:37.489> obviously<00:02:37.790> have<00:02:37.939> their<00:02:38.180> sort<00:02:38.420> of

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
they'll obviously have their sort of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.089 
they'll obviously have their sort of
training<00:02:38.720> time<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.200> their<00:02:39.290> periods<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.920> get

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
training time and their periods to get

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.160 
training time and their periods to get
used<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.579> ball<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.840> won't<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.139> a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
used to the ball so it won't be a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.520 
used to the ball so it won't be a
problem

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
problem

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.619 
problem
it<00:02:42.769> sounds<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.159> me<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:44.120> gone<00:02:44.359> -

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
it sounds to me like it's it's gone -

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.080 
it sounds to me like it's it's gone -
it's<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.769> like<00:02:45.889> it's<00:02:46.040> not<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.579> jubal<00:02:46.849> army

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
it's not me like it's not the jubal army

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.789 
it's not me like it's not the jubal army
it<00:02:47.180> sounds<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.569> it's<00:02:47.720> better<00:02:47.959> than<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.560> Juba

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
it sounds like it's better than the Juba

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.259 
it sounds like it's better than the Juba
Lonnie<00:02:48.980> berry<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> don't<00:02:49.700> think<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:50.209> will

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
Lonnie berry yeah I don't think it will

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.970 
Lonnie berry yeah I don't think it will
deviate<00:02:50.599> as<00:02:50.810> much<00:02:51.139> I<00:02:51.319> think<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.530> Juba<00:02:51.799> Lonnie

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
deviate as much I think the Juba Lonnie

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.860 
deviate as much I think the Juba Lonnie
knight<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.579> last<00:02:52.819> sort<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.299> two<00:02:53.629> or<00:02:53.720> three

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
knight in the last sort of two or three

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.240 
knight in the last sort of two or three
yards<00:02:54.109> of<00:02:54.139> its<00:02:54.260> flight<00:02:54.439> it<00:02:54.620> could<00:02:54.769> move<00:02:54.919> a<00:02:55.069> yard

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
yards of its flight it could move a yard

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.740 
yards of its flight it could move a yard
that<00:02:55.879> was<00:02:56.000> here<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.239> was<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.389> nightmare<00:02:56.720> for

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
that was here that was a nightmare for

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.119 
that was here that was a nightmare for
goalkeepers<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.319> think<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:57.769> will<00:02:57.950> move

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
goalkeepers I think this one will move

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.610 
goalkeepers I think this one will move
but<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.730> as<00:02:58.970> much<00:02:59.419> that'd<00:02:59.689> be<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.079> little<00:03:00.470> bit

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
but not as much that'd be a little bit

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.659 
but not as much that'd be a little bit
better<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:00.889> gold<00:03:01.040> keys<00:03:01.159> but<00:03:01.340> who<00:03:01.400> cares<00:03:01.609> about

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
better for gold keys but who cares about

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.830 
better for gold keys but who cares about
gold<00:03:01.939> cubes<00:03:02.120> anyway<00:03:04.209> yeah<00:03:05.239> goalkeepers

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
gold cubes anyway yeah goalkeepers

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.129 
gold cubes anyway yeah goalkeepers
you're<00:03:06.109> weirdos<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:07.549> about<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.139> colors

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.659 
you're weirdos and what about the colors
in<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.349> ball<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.799> ready<00:03:10.010> cooled<00:03:10.310> earlier

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
in the ball I was ready cooled earlier

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:11.949 
in the ball I was ready cooled earlier
for<00:03:10.849> Senate<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.209> didn't<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:11.689> like<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
for Senate I didn't really like the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.690 
for Senate I didn't really like the
design<00:03:12.439> on<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.829> at<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.129> it<00:03:13.280> wasn't

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
design on it at what it wasn't

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.390 
design on it at what it wasn't
symmetrical<00:03:14.389> its<00:03:14.750> squiggly<00:03:15.379> lines<00:03:15.650> did<00:03:16.189> that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
symmetrical its squiggly lines did that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.890 
symmetrical its squiggly lines did that
affect<00:03:16.730> anything<00:03:17.299> at<00:03:17.419> all<00:03:17.510> when<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.810> was

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
affect anything at all when it was

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.110 
affect anything at all when it was
flying<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.379> colors<00:03:18.530> coming<00:03:18.979> out<00:03:19.159> yeah<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.849> it

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
flying the colors coming out yeah and it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.180 
flying the colors coming out yeah and it
didn't<00:03:20.359> out<00:03:20.479> there<00:03:20.659> but<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.019> think<00:03:21.319> with<00:03:22.159> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
didn't out there but I think with a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.369 
didn't out there but I think with a
crowd<00:03:22.579> if<00:03:23.359> you<00:03:23.449> were<00:03:23.540> passing<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.989> long<00:03:24.139> ball

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
crowd if you were passing a long ball

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.839 
crowd if you were passing a long ball
and<00:03:24.409> obviously<00:03:24.859> a<00:03:24.919> crowd<00:03:25.159> if<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> lose<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.790> in

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
and obviously a crowd if you lose it in

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.009 
and obviously a crowd if you lose it in
the<00:03:25.879> floodlights<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.510> stuff<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:26.840> that

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
the floodlights and stuff like that

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.330 
the floodlights and stuff like that
night<00:03:27.349> matches<00:03:27.829> is<00:03:27.949> going<00:03:28.129> to<00:03:28.190> be<00:03:28.280> an

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
night matches is going to be an

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.740

interesting<00:03:28.609> one<00:03:28.879> I<00:03:29.030> could<00:03:29.269> see<00:03:29.479> that<00:03:29.629> that

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
interesting one I could see that that

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.509 
interesting one I could see that that
might<00:03:30.109> be<00:03:30.169> a<00:03:30.590> little<00:03:30.709> bit<00:03:30.919> difficult<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.340> some

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
