00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello everyone today got someone like that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.830
 wonderful brother job stm 400 watt 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.059
 new ones 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 they are even sold here for food 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 CPU already 8 pin connector 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 divided into two fruits as a block 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 power easy just air and 400 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.420
 watts here if we take say thermaltake 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 old 420 water is just a brick month 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.480
 ice too old averman 300 watt too 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 heavy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 Well, let's see maybe the Chinese 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 applied some high 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.450
 technology on on development in business 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 that allow you to make light blocks 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 power and get more power 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 disassembled this power supply review by 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.770
 input filter impulse noise and someone 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.050
 you are completely absent 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.910
 choke replaced jumpers 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.610
 capacitors not soldered and correct 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.119
 finally only need to interfere and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 cost shake further diode bridge 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.689
 that's such small diodes unsoldered 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.930
 high voltage capacitor here 330 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.549
 device yes let's see the transistor 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.990
 the generator turns out there are two keys torus 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.259
 2 and polar transistors with this watched 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.930
 I have written their characteristics on the Internet 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 80 watts i.e. it turns out they work 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.509
 in pulse mode it is every 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 160 watt transistor only gives 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 how do they work every sandal period 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.590
 it turns out 320 you can knock out here 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.930
 PSU have written a 400-watt 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.050
 generator 320 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.450
 then pulse transformer here such 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.200
 small is worth but on it and not say that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.680
 he 400 watts can give a radiator well 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.209
 Seen Chinese saving on remy climbs in 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.670
 thin as I do not know what to do here 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.580
 throttle group stabilization costs 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.260
 one single choke on line 5 and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.150
 12 volts to 33 times longer soldered yet 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.540
 capacitors are not decoupled and correctly 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.530
 see they need baby food will 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.580
 grow here such a good light 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.090
 power supply what i want to say is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.340
 most real Chinese pro budo if 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.950
 see don't buy one like that 400 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.540
 watt you will not give out at best watts 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:53.230
 250 let's show for etching such 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.230
 300 watt old powerman 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.560
 we can stand here with a damper 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.950
 capacitor resistor filter 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.320
 impulse noise from thrown unsoldered 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.560
 the capacitor is soldered as it should be 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.830
 and here is a diode bridge 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.590
 the capacitor at 470 microfarad is worth 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.570
 such a 300 watt transformer is not 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.660
 at 400 to 300 watts worth this 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.180
 the transformer here is watching you choke 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.790
 group stabilization on line 5 and 12 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.560
 volt even thicker so more on 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.320
 lines 3 3 volts choke this 300th 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.940
 Here are three honest 300 in the yard food 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:44.120
 but this is the real Chinese 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 guber yes where power is written just from 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.390
 noodle
