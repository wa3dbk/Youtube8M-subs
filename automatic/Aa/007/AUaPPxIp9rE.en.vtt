00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 this is the net atmo weather station with the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 optional indoor module well this is it 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.760
 complete weather station that you see in front of you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.040
 And we see the very elegant and beautiful 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 looks like we see the debts 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.490
 modules is located here in the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.170
 you will find the main module in the middle 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 module is also connected to the cable 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.289
 the nutrition and this is also in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.119
 connection to your WiFi network that couple 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
 you find at the start how that goes 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.900
 each remember atmo on the website 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 In addition, we see that with every module 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.439
 a kind of slot through the front 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.179
 to be able to breathe just so 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.260
 and this is also the case with the main module 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.550
 like a light bulb 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.989
 you see that for example if you order one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 that man does measurement if you meet the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.440
 top click then he goes one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.149
 do manual measurement normally 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 he does every five or ten minutes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.969
 measurement and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640
 well then do those measurements then study 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 directly to the internet he 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.879
 collects and details all 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.320
 connected modules 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.059
 to the outside module is those choices 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 as the name suggests outside placement 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 can also possibly hang up 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 so nice because there is just going on yes 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 then you go here at the back 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.760
 and the great thing about the outside module is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.199
 that he also followed outside of everything 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 Well , for example, I am back inside 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.409
 of course you have several rooms 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.580
 Hoven module usually have in the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.900
 living room 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.820
 and you also want to know information about 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.229
 your bedroom certainly example how fresh 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.299
 air there once okay so the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.010
 use optional indoor module and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.360
 all modules separately from the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.830
 main goals that work on triple a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 batteries and these also become common 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.140
 included 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.060
 well what does this whole system do 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 collects data it sends to the internet 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 and may from the end via the website 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.189
 everything seen through your account 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.900
 well the nice thing about the website is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.400
 of course another app that you can just do 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.040
 install on your tablet on you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.509
 smartphone both android and ios to we 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.799
 see the app open here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.720
 on this with him but only hope 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 module connected so that's why we just 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 a 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.380
 see collected data and the main module 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 some data 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 well of course temperature 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 humidity and air pressure 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.729
 but a number of things also extra such as 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 for example the co2 where the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 the so good gauge of how fresh 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 air actually is in the room 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 and we see that he is now orange too 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 and if it is still further away 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.119
 he will not with so great 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.950
 in addition you will also find one 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 sound meter in the main module so then 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 he also knows how much noise there is around you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.680
 Well there is the rest you have with the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.360
 outside module only temperature 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.320
 humidity in air pressure have more 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 you actually don't need it either 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.679
 and at the extra official indoors 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.120
 they measure the same as the main module 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.580
 except then 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.379
 the the noise level so that is it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 only thing he doesn't take with it is the beautiful 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.980
 that is that you still have all the data here 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.750
 can still see in nice graphics and also 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.640
 some predictions for the coming days 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.709
 he loves the internet and you can too 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 You can also zoom in on those graphs 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.799
 you see example temperature of the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.819
 last few hours you can just go here 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.659
 recover 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.640
 and you can go all the way 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.290
 And besides that I have never been 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.090
 For example, notifications run your co2 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.760
 value in a particular room above the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.440
 1000 yes, you will receive a notification 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.209
 van hey it's over 1000 it's not 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 life threatening but you know the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.870
 yes the room is not very fresh anymore 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.310
 so then you might want one 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.079
 open window 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.609
 well apart from the app you just don't have that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.769
 me here in a folder were 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.269
 they collect all data from this 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.530
 weather stations you can switch on or off 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.060
 whether or not it wants to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 and then you can immediately see how hot or 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.989
 cold it is in a certain place 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.459
 europe for example now you want more 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.230
 information about this net atmosphere 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.819
 station or do you want him to go right away 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.940
 order with or without that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.269
 optional indoor module please go to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.400
 pdashop.nl 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.819
 or point b or come of course in one 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.819
 from our stores
