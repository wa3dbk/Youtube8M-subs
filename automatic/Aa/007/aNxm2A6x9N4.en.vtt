want<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.240> apply<00:03:58.750> class<00:03:59.050> name<00:03:59.349> Center<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.040> then

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
want to apply class name Center and then

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.880 
want to apply class name Center and then
this<00:04:00.610> will<00:04:00.819> be<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.120> class<00:04:01.890> with

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
this will be a class with

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.460 
this will be a class with
text-align:center<00:04:03.580> within<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:05.319> this

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
text-align:center within it and this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.740 
text-align:center within it and this
will<00:04:05.709> align<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.340> text<00:04:06.730> within<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.360> container

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
will align the text within the container

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.589 
will align the text within the container
once<00:04:08.349> you<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.650> space<00:04:09.040> center<00:04:09.700> within<00:04:10.390> the

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
once you do space center within the

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.660 
once you do space center within the
class<00:04:10.840> attribute<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:12.250> will<00:04:12.400> line<00:04:12.550> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
class attribute and it will line the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.840 
class attribute and it will line the
text<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.180> center<00:04:13.569> like<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.380> now<00:04:15.340> what<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.730> may

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
text to center like so now what you may

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.909 
text to center like so now what you may
want<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.060> do<00:04:16.150> is<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.450> may<00:04:16.600> want<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.930> align<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
want to do is you may want to align the

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
want to do is you may want to align the
container<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.970> center<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.840> document

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
container to the center of the document

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.500 
container to the center of the document
so<00:04:20.950> what<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.459> do<00:04:21.579> margin<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.210> then

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
so what you do is you do margin and then

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.629 
so what you do is you do margin and then
however<00:04:22.900> pixels<00:04:23.560> from<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.770> top<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.400> I'm<00:04:24.490> going

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
however pixels from the top so I'm going

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.810 
however pixels from the top so I'm going
to<00:04:24.700> do<00:04:24.790> 20<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.050> write<00:04:26.230> Auto<00:04:26.820> now

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
to do 20 and then you write Auto now

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.080 
to do 20 and then you write Auto now
Auto<00:04:28.060> will<00:04:28.919> automate<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.130> left<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:30.880> right

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
Auto will automate the left and right

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.960 
Auto will automate the left and right
hand<00:04:31.360> pixels<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.050> make<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.710> center<00:04:33.070> now

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
hand pixels to make it in the center now

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.190 
hand pixels to make it in the center now
we're<00:04:34.240> going<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.450> be<00:04:34.540> connecting<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
we're going to be connecting to the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.800 
we're going to be connecting to the
database<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:36.340> we're<00:04:36.460> going<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.810> phpMyAdmin

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
database so we're going to phpMyAdmin

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.810 
database so we're going to phpMyAdmin
within<00:04:38.169> localhost<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.950> we<00:04:39.100> select<00:04:39.370> databases

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
within localhost and we select databases

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.670 
within localhost and we select databases
then<00:04:40.780> we're<00:04:41.080> going<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.260> create<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.530> new

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
then we're going to create a new

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.050 
then we're going to create a new
database<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.400> then<00:04:42.880> membership

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.240 

once<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.810> state<00:04:50.020> space<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.230> created<00:04:51.040> you'll

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
once the state space is created you'll

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.000 
once the state space is created you'll
see<00:04:51.460> appear<00:04:51.790> on<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.060> left<00:04:52.290> then<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:53.560> log<00:04:53.800> in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
see appear on the left then we log in

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.590 
see appear on the left then we log in
and<00:04:54.160> you<00:04:54.700> can<00:04:54.850> see<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.480> our

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
and you can see that this is our

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.500 
and you can see that this is our
database<00:04:55.810> with<00:04:56.290> no<00:04:56.470> tables<00:04:56.890> in<00:04:56.980> it<00:04:57.100> yet<00:04:57.510> so

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
database with no tables in it yet so

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.000 
database with no tables in it yet so
we're<00:04:58.630> going<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.810> do<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:59.020> when<00:04:59.170> you<00:04:59.260> file<00:04:59.530> new

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
we're going to do is when you file new

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.100 
we're going to do is when you file new
and<00:05:00.420> we're<00:05:01.420> going<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.600> create<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.810> new<00:05:01.960> PHP

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
and we're going to create a new PHP

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.560 
and we're going to create a new PHP
document<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.830> just<00:05:02.860> open<00:05:03.490> PHP<00:05:03.760> tag<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.360> close

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
document and just open PHP tag and close

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.660 
document and just open PHP tag and close
the<00:05:04.690> PHP<00:05:04.870> tag<00:05:05.200> then<00:05:06.040> we're<00:05:06.340> going<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.520> write

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
the PHP tag then we're going to write

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.820 
the PHP tag then we're going to write
MySQL<00:05:07.270> underscore<00:05:07.390> connect<00:05:08.050> now<00:05:08.350> this<00:05:08.560> takes

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
MySQL underscore connect now this takes

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.160 
MySQL underscore connect now this takes
three<00:05:09.280> arguments<00:05:09.670> I'm<00:05:10.060> going<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.810> split<00:05:10.990> each

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
three arguments I'm going to split each

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.860 
three arguments I'm going to split each
argument<00:05:11.440> up<00:05:11.800> over<00:05:12.340> comma<00:05:12.600> leaving<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.690> comma

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
argument up over comma leaving the comma

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.730 
argument up over comma leaving the comma
out<00:05:13.990> at<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.530> end<00:05:15.930> then<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.290> first<00:05:17.530> argument

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
out at the end then the first argument

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.510 
out at the end then the first argument
is<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.160> server<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.940> for<00:05:19.120> me<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.480> localhost

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
is the server so for me is localhost

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.610 
is the server so for me is localhost
then<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:21.850> using<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.630> for<00:05:22.780> me<00:05:22.900> is<00:05:23.080> root<00:05:23.350> and

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
then it's using it so for me is root and

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.440 
then it's using it so for me is root and
then<00:05:24.040> password<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.730> I<00:05:24.760> just<00:05:25.000> named<00:05:25.210> mine

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
then password and I just named mine

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.640 
then password and I just named mine
password<00:05:26.550> then<00:05:27.550> we<00:05:28.090> do<00:05:28.270> could<00:05:28.750> not<00:05:28.780> connect<00:05:29.320> to

global dot PHP within the scripts folder

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.490 
global dot PHP within the scripts folder
then<00:06:47.360> once<00:06:48.360> that's<00:06:48.570> done<00:06:48.840> we<00:06:49.590> can<00:06:49.740> save<00:06:50.400> as

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
then once that's done we can save as

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.210 
then once that's done we can save as
login<00:06:52.500> dot<00:06:52.650> PHP<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:54.380> we<00:06:55.380> can<00:06:55.530> just<00:06:55.770> change<00:06:55.919> the

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
login dot PHP and we can just change the

don't need to change on login dot PHP

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.760 
don't need to change on login dot PHP
then<00:07:06.330> we<00:07:06.419> just<00:07:06.599> do<00:07:06.720> the<00:07:06.810> same<00:07:07.050> for<00:07:07.380> register
