00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.660
 once the exit is done, it takes as much 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.910
 before the rolls to reveal the movie 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.430
 photographic once exposed as best 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.230
 it is revealed beware of the 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.090
 excessively cheap revelations 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.250
 Most are made with chemicals 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.000
 exhausted and do not draw colors with all 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.950
 its intensity 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.410
 It is best that you reveal in your store 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.030
 Trust if the day was cloudy 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.039
 We recommend that you order your copies in 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.820
 brightness will draw more strongly 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.470
 colors 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.710
 the glitter paper is quite spectacular 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.140
 but it has two problems 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 the first are those annoying reflections 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 that produces the paper when canceling the copy 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 and the second that if you touch a lot 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.289
 photos will appear traces 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 If in any picture they bother you in excess 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.170
 wash the copy with running water and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.980
 drying 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.980
 they will disappear 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.540
 if instead you had a very sunny day 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.970
 It is preferable to order the copies in mate 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.690
 the elegance of the mate captivates us 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.240
 most photographers 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.920
 If you can avoid asking for your copies in 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.810
 size of 10 x 15 is one size 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.910
 excessively small intended 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 mainly to the amateur without 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.710
 photographic concerns for a little 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.110
 more you can do them in 13 by 18 a 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 size where you will see and show a lot 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 better your progress 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.549
 Regarding the margin issue if you ask 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 the photo will be better delimited the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.750
 framing will look more accurate but if not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.060
 you ask, it will look bigger 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.430
 just receive your copies and after a 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.800
 inevitable first glance leave them a 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.170
 moment aside and the first buy a 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.360
 small album of negatives with leaves and 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.030
 file manipulating them always by 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.979
 its edge avoids putting your fingers to 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.470
 that do not take traces the negative one has to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.660
 spoil it if a copy is spoiled 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.580
 another and it's over if it spoiled negative 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.500
 we will never have the copy 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.210
 if he has revealed to you the copies of a good 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.120
 laboratory probably the negatives 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.980
 come already protected in stored cases 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.510
 for when you ask for second copies and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.140
 you have to deliver the negative in the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.850
 store 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220
 You can also enter the date of the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
 exit and the place where you made it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.760
 things as time goes by is very 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.270
 gratifying to have them well targeted 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.800
 so you can easily remember them now 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.080
 maybe the most important thing comes from the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.880
 exit once seen several times 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.850
 photos to calm that anxiety logic 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.459
 Take your notebook and one to one especially 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.650
 the important photos go checking 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.770
 everything you did and point you will see 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.810
 how fast you learn a tip when 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 look at your photographs avoid doing it under 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.370
 the light of the fluorescent one because it is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.989
 lighting turn off the colors look at them 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.690
 whenever you can under the lighting 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.030
 of filament or halogen bulbs or 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.980
 if not with the natural light of the street 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 point out what you consider your best 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.810
 photographs the diaphragm values 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.330
 focal speed and so on for possible 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.630
 contests or future exhibitions 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.340
 do not underestimate you never know break 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.830
 those that do not say anything but you're eye 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.350
 starting do not be too hard on yourself and 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.740
 you keep in albums well classified the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.960
 the rest 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.090
 If any picture made you very excited and 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.680
 it did not work out, save it soon 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.510
 we will teach to put it in the computer 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.330
 in order to be able to touch up and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.040
 transform it if necessary and by 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.870
 course another good advice that you 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.580
 we want to give is that those two or three 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.160
 fabulous pictures you've got 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.920
 in this output and that you are happy with 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.930
 them the larger ones to larger size and go 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.450
 preparing a special album of your 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.400
 better jobs for you to teach it that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.650
 see your friends as far as you go 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.300
 you may well understand why those who 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.670
 we know photography like you now 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.340
 it took more than the account to make a 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 picture to see if between all and all 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.930
 we are teaching the people of this country 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.310
 that one thing is to take pictures and another very 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.170
 different practice photography 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.580
 also if something good has paper 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.680
 photographic is that in any 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.300
 metro or bus cafe 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.190
 You can show your works in the way 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.750
 more comfortable 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.849
 another curious thing that you should know if 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.770
 is that in the laboratory the 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.630
 Image size will not match 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.250
 always with the paper so 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.470
 depending on what size they can cut 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.650
 part of the photo to avoid this you 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.609
 we recommend enlargement sizes of 18 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.609
 x 24 20 x 30 or 30 x 45 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.440
 if you made your photos with digital camera 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
 first we will place the cable 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.240
 Connecting the camera to the computer 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.630
 in this way we can use the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 software that comes with the camera 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.200
 with this program we will be selecting 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.150
 the photos that interest us now 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.020
 then we will start the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.020
 transfer of images 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.200
 once on the computer we will click 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.050
 on the photo and they will appear 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.540
 Your data speed focal diaphragm 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.420
 we can also manipulate our 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.330
 I like the images enlarging the spinning 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.300
 investing them and how not to touch up 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.400
 to correct possible failures by 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.010
 last we will record them on a CD-ROM and the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.840
 We will take you to our developing store 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.820
 where from this digital support 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.490
 they will give us the photos on photo paper 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.590
 conventional system this much more 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.180
 economic and higher quality than 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.280
 ink printer 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.979
 in the same way it has been used 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.570
 conventional photographic film you can 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.270
 ask in your shop to scan your 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.699
 photos that you like most on a CD-ROM and 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.220
 with this one transfer them to the computer 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.169
 this way you can manipulate them the same 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.350
 that if I took them out with a camera 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.350
 digital
