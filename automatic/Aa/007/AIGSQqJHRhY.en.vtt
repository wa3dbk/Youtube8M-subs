00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
wanted it to look really dirty and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.700 
wanted it to look really dirty and
greedy<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.340> used<00:01:40.760> at<00:01:41.030> our<00:01:41.690> tracks<00:01:42.170> her<00:01:42.380> shade

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
greedy so I used at our tracks her shade

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.160 
greedy so I used at our tracks her shade
which<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.120> new<00:01:44.390> version<00:01:44.960> of

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
which is that the the the new version of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.160 
which is that the the the new version of
Devlin<00:01:45.710> mud<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.790> applied<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.510> one<00:01:47.780> for

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
Devlin mud and I applied this one for

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.740 
Devlin mud and I applied this one for
the<00:01:48.440> whole<00:01:48.650> back<00:01:49.010> part<00:01:49.550> or<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.240> underside

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750

the whole back part or the the underside
of<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.430> vehicle<00:01:52.430> just<00:01:52.460> because<00:01:53.120> I<00:01:53.150> wanted<00:01:53.660> it

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
canopy up and then I went with a badger

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.960 
canopy up and then I went with a badger
Minatare<00:02:02.870> charted<00:02:03.410> stone<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.100> did<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> little

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
Minatare charted stone and did a little

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.710 
Minatare charted stone and did a little
bit<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.300> line<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.130> simulate

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
bit of a line and just to simulate

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320 
bit of a line and just to simulate
reflection<00:02:08.720> on<00:02:08.989> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
reflection on the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.290 
reflection on the
the<00:02:10.420> main<00:02:10.660> canopy<00:02:11.110> itself<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.820> little<00:02:13.150> bit

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the main canopy itself so a little bit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.730 
the main canopy itself so a little bit
of<00:02:13.360> chart<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.870> gone<00:02:14.110> which<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> really

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
of chart it's gone which is a really

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.980 
of chart it's gone which is a really
dark<00:02:15.040> gray<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:16.060> after<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.600> we're

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
dark gray and then after that we're

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.650 
dark gray and then after that we're
gonna<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:18.100> we're<00:02:18.250> gonna<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
gonna be going is we're gonna go for a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.920 
gonna be going is we're gonna go for a
badger<00:02:20.050> fur<00:02:20.680> which<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> great<00:02:22.210> dome<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
badger fur which is a great dome just to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
badger fur which is a great dome just to
make<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.260> more<00:02:23.500> pop<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> little<00:02:24.520> bit<00:02:24.700> more<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
make it more pop a little bit more the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.340 
make it more pop a little bit more the
last<00:02:27.970> step<00:02:28.240> for<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.510> canopy<00:02:28.930> was<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
last step for the canopy was just to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.500 
last step for the canopy was just to
take<00:02:29.530> some<00:02:29.740> white<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.180> put<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> little

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
take some white and then put a little

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.600 
take some white and then put a little
dot<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.050> there<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.890> was<00:02:33.040> skull<00:02:33.370> white

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
dot on there because it was skull white

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.710 
dot on there because it was skull white
now<00:02:34.450> onto<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:36.070> super<00:02:36.880> OSL<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
now onto the the super OSL for the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.170 
now onto the the super OSL for the
reactors<00:02:38.590> first<00:02:39.310> color<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.640> i<00:02:39.910> actually

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
reactors first color that i actually

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.780 
reactors first color that i actually
used<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.170> warning<00:02:41.830> yellow<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
used for this is warning yellow so I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.020 
used for this is warning yellow so I
started<00:02:43.510> straight<00:02:44.320> on<00:02:44.500> no<00:02:45.040> white<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:45.880> it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
started straight on no white just so it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.780 
started straight on no white just so it
it<00:02:46.660> looks<00:02:46.930> transparent<00:02:47.710> started<00:02:48.310> doing<00:02:48.580> some

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
it looks transparent started doing some

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.720 
it looks transparent started doing some
warning<00:02:49.210> yellow<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.810> there<00:02:50.280> where<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> three

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
warning yellow on there where the three

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.600 
warning yellow on there where the three
engines<00:02:52.180> are<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.600> thought<00:02:53.190> at<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> beginning<00:02:54.550> I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
engines are I thought at the beginning I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.100 
engines are I thought at the beginning I
thought<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.970> only<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.330> two<00:02:55.510> dots<00:02:55.750> were<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
thought that only the two dots were the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.780 
thought that only the two dots were the
engine<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:56.650> after<00:02:56.920> looking<00:02:57.220> at<00:02:57.340> reference

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
engine but after looking at reference

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.550 
engine but after looking at reference
picture<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.150> realized<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> bar<00:02:59.140> at<00:02:59.350> home

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
picture I realized that the bar at home

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.580 
picture I realized that the bar at home
top<00:02:59.800> was<00:03:00.010> also<00:03:00.580> an<00:03:00.760> engine<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:01.780> that's<00:03:01.900> why<00:03:02.170> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
top was also an engine so that's why I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.390 
top was also an engine so that's why I
went<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.340> for<00:03:04.330> those<00:03:04.480> three<00:03:04.920> places<00:03:05.920> then

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
went for for those three places then

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.460 
went for for those three places then
after<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.940> took<00:03:07.000> some<00:03:07.390> skull<00:03:07.960> white<00:03:08.200> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
after that I took some skull white and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.460 
after that I took some skull white and
then<00:03:08.980> only<00:03:09.250> did<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.730> inside<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
then only did the inside of the the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
then only did the inside of the the
engine<00:03:11.830> itself<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.850> go<00:03:13.000> back<00:03:13.240> with<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
engine itself to go back with a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.390 
engine itself to go back with a
different<00:03:13.990> kind<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.260> yellow<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:14.830> make<00:03:15.130> that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
different kind of yellow but make that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970 
different kind of yellow but make that
yellow<00:03:15.730> pop<00:03:15.970> locks<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.350> would<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.739> just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
yellow pop locks if I would have just

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.710 
yellow pop locks if I would have just
went<00:03:18.489> straight<00:03:18.640> yellow<00:03:19.030> on<00:03:19.239> top<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
went straight yellow on top of the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.960 
went straight yellow on top of the
previous<00:03:19.930> base<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.620> would<00:03:20.739> have<00:03:20.860> not<00:03:21.070> had<00:03:21.310> that

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
previous base it would have not had that

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.210 
previous base it would have not had that
much<00:03:22.239> impact<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.170> much<00:03:23.410> vivid<00:03:23.950> color

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
much impact in that much vivid color

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.580 
much impact in that much vivid color
that<00:03:24.940> would<00:03:25.120> have<00:03:25.239> came<00:03:25.450> out<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.260> so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
that would have came out out of it so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.910 
that would have came out out of it so
did<00:03:27.190> some<00:03:27.459> white<00:03:27.730> there<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.300> then<00:03:28.770> now<00:03:29.770> I'm

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
did some white there and then now I'm

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.150 
did some white there and then now I'm
gonna<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.280> changing<00:03:30.520> with<00:03:31.120> four<00:03:31.770> if<00:03:32.770> I'm<00:03:32.980> not

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
gonna be changing with four if I'm not

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.030 
gonna be changing with four if I'm not

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
yellow for a minute there badger lion

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.270 
yellow for a minute there badger lion
and<00:03:40.600> then<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.140> just<00:03:41.530> did<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.920> in<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.250> middle

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
and then I just did that in the middle

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.810 
and then I just did that in the middle
by<00:03:42.760> keeping<00:03:43.180> all<00:03:43.500> trying<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.680> keep<00:03:44.890> my<00:03:45.070> warning

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
by keeping all trying to keep my warning

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.270 
by keeping all trying to keep my warning
yellow<00:03:46.180> still<00:03:47.050> outside<00:03:47.470> not<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.950> too<00:03:48.100> much

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
yellow still outside not going too much

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.940 
yellow still outside not going too much
over<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:49.000> then<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.720> went<00:03:49.959> back<00:03:50.290> again<00:03:50.320> with

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
over it and then I went back again with

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.490 
over it and then I went back again with
some<00:03:51.130> white<00:03:51.430> just<00:03:52.300> for<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.840> inside<00:03:53.290> to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
some white just for the inside to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.620 
some white just for the inside to
simulate<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.220> hotness<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.000> engine<00:03:55.450> and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
simulate the hotness of the engine and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.170 
simulate the hotness of the engine and
that<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:56.470> glow<00:03:56.800> effect<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> middle

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
that that glow effect just in the middle

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.840 
that that glow effect just in the middle
part<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.840> then<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.560> finish<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.310> top<00:04:00.520> it<00:04:00.700> off

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
part and then to finish it to top it off

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.500 
part and then to finish it to top it off
then<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.330> went<00:04:01.600> back<00:04:01.870> with<00:04:01.900> my<00:04:02.470> warning<00:04:03.040> yellow

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
then I went back with my warning yellow

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.979 
then I went back with my warning yellow
