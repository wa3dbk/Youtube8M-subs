00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 came in three guys in this my first 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.259
 video on my apple world channel 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 today I will show you the best 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.590
 applications that I operate mine 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.640
 i.e. iphone 4 device 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.060
 then we put it around is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.310
 a facebook application that we 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.519
 allows you to send messages with 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.050
 the latest update also call 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:36.440
 obviously with internet connection 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can call and send messages 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:50.100
 no more then nothing more then we have viber 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.780
 or viber that allows us to call e 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 messaging for free 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.410
 here we have a keyboard the contacts the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.489
 last things we did in this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 the unloader that we have the messages 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.049
 that we have sent or m messaggiamo 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 then something else to change the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.060
 our profile 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.119
 the name of the image behind etcetera 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 then of course we can symbols 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.680
 call for free as I said e 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.799
 we always need one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 internet or 3g connection we have many 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.659
 xto this an application that there 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 lets you have emoticons like 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.290
 keyboard 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.049
 in this way we have the letters i 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.100
 numbers all the rest then here in the world 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 we used to say when those who come out are beaten 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 Sign up emoticons as you activate 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.570
 download on the app store 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.570
 let's go to general settings 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.649
 keyboard keyboards and reaches a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.009
 keyboard and add us 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.049
 and so we have the emoticon as one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.750
 normal keyboard 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.930
 then we have 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.180
 or display recorder that the application 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.340
 he is using now downloadable from cydia 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.750
 then to download to download 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.290
 this application we need 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.630
 a jailbroken device that is recommended 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.220
 and don't worry I'll do it sooner or later 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.500
 a video where I'll put you have to do or where 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.360
 I will show you how it will download ie how 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.040
 will install to cydia on your 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:43.880
 device for iphone 4 4s 3gs 3 to 4 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:49.160
 ipad 3 etc. 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.050
 obviously for 6 point 1.3 and it is a premium 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.150
 it's a tethered jailbreak 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.020
 but nothing the red then we have to the tubes 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.800
 what you need to download a free food 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.850
 by clicking on if so arches are pronounced 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.720
 we put in the name of the song that 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.660
 we want history to be saved later 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.989
 we can also add the playlist 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.850
 etc 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.230
 obviously we need to look for it 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.180
 of internet 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.370
 then when it will be saved in history 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.330
 we can listen to music without it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:29.540
 an internet connection and then how 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:32.180
 we have burrell that allows us 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.580
 to change the way they turn 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.269
 the pages in this way this is the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.360
 coop side nightmare side mode 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:48.970
 now let's try changing modes 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:53.299
 sleep mode we put snake for example 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.540
 you have seen how to change or 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.820
 we can also put random that is yes 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.970
 randomly turns the random 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:09.190
 look at this every time it changes then 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.190
 enough, however, I prefer as a side anyway 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.989
 wait for the jumper to turn up the volume 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.609
 for today it is all we see the next one 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.269
 video I recommend that which me 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.780
 like to sign up and if you want to know 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.280
 something 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.410
 write it in the comments or 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.770
 suggest the next videos and that's it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.770
 bye Bye
