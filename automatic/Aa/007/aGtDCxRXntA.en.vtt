 good battery but I found this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.350
 fins ix company that is here giving 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 letting you recharge your computer or your 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.119
 phone and took the opportunity to show me 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 right now it 's the laptop charger 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 smallest in the whole world we're going to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.070
 talk about the whole world let's talk 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.800

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 watts and can load computers like 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820

 you are watching it connects has 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.719
 different adapters but the most 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 surprising is again the size for 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 do not get confused here we have a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.340
 apple charger and look at the difference 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.219
 is 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.799
 2 almost 2 connectors of these for one of 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.689
 support so it's double or a little 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.549
 more than twice as small and it's not 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.350
 only the smallest but the most 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.719
 nice because look at the colors that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.069

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.130
 very well still not available 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.929
 they were a kickstart project and they have already 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.520
 won the money they had to raise 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.090

 market the official price is 89 dollars 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.380

 discount and the truth is that it is 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.310
