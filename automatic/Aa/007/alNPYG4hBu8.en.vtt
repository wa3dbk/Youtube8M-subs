beta<00:00:25.160> was<00:00:25.400> kind<00:00:25.610> of<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:26.000> wasn't<00:00:26.210> clear<00:00:26.510> to

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
beta was kind of it wasn't clear to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.230 
beta was kind of it wasn't clear to
begin<00:00:26.930> with<00:00:27.110> but<00:00:27.350> I'm<00:00:27.530> adding<00:00:27.830> white<00:00:28.280> base

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
begin with but I'm adding white base

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.679 
begin with but I'm adding white base
coat<00:00:29.510> to<00:00:29.690> it<00:00:29.810> anyhow<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.470> usually<00:00:31.280> you<00:00:32.210> can<00:00:32.390> you

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
coat to it anyhow so usually you can you

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.569 
coat to it anyhow so usually you can you
could<00:00:32.840> do<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.170> pattern<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:34.070> Tennessee

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
could do this pattern this Tennessee

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.279 
could do this pattern this Tennessee
shad<00:00:34.850> he<00:00:35.030> could<00:00:35.180> do<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.420> ghost<00:00:35.629> pattern<00:00:36.079> too

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
shad he could do it a ghost pattern too

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.910 
shad he could do it a ghost pattern too
and<00:00:36.500> do<00:00:36.920> not<00:00:37.100> add<00:00:37.310> the<00:00:37.340> white<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:38.000> uh<00:00:38.920> really

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and do not add the white is uh really

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.090 
and do not add the white is uh really
the<00:00:40.040> only<00:00:40.280> difference<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:40.700> you<00:00:40.910> would<00:00:41.060> do

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.830 

looks<00:00:49.100> like<00:00:49.280> still<00:00:49.940> adding<00:00:50.210> some<00:00:50.390> white<00:00:50.570> paint

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
looks like still adding some white paint

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
looks like still adding some white paint

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
a little more hit with the blow dryer

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:08.050 
a little more hit with the blow dryer
quick<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.820> add<00:00:58.820> another<00:00:59.090> coat<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:08.000> I

quick and add another coat so now here I
got<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.479> black<00:01:08.719> I'll<00:01:09.350> go<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.679> the<00:01:09.770> back<00:01:09.950> side

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
got the black I'll go on the back side

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:11.980 
got the black I'll go on the back side
and<00:01:10.459> I<00:01:10.609> kind<00:01:10.939> of<00:01:10.999> fade<00:01:11.179> it<00:01:11.299> down<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.600> sides<00:01:11.840> a

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
and I kind of fade it down the sides a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.169 
and I kind of fade it down the sides a
little<00:01:12.079> bit<00:01:12.319> and<00:01:12.619> turn<00:01:13.459> down<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.729> PIAT<00:01:13.969> the

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
little bit and turn down the PIAT the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.649 
little bit and turn down the PIAT the
air<00:01:14.509> pressure<00:01:14.810> here<00:01:15.229> trying<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.590> get<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.889> right

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
air pressure here trying to get it right

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.139 
air pressure here trying to get it right
just<00:01:17.659> probably<00:01:18.020> around<00:01:18.109> 10<00:01:18.439> psi<00:01:18.950> or<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:19.310> and

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
just probably around 10 psi or so and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.870 
just probably around 10 psi or so and
when<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.299> get<00:01:20.799> black<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.159> very<00:01:22.189> unforgiving

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
when you get black is a very unforgiving

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.719 
when you get black is a very unforgiving
color<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.479> paint<00:01:23.740> against<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.950> white<00:01:25.399> or<00:01:25.700> a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
color to paint against a white or a

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.789 
color to paint against a white or a
light<00:01:26.060> color<00:01:26.509> like<00:01:26.749> that<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.679> the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
light color like that because of the

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.169 
light color like that because of the
tendency<00:01:28.759> if<00:01:29.029> for<00:01:29.209> it<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.420> splatter<00:01:29.779> and<00:01:31.179> so

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
tendency if for it to splatter and so

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.319 
tendency if for it to splatter and so
shooting<00:01:32.959> really<00:01:33.200> low<00:01:33.380> PSI<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.340> keeping<00:01:35.270> a

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
shooting really low PSI and keeping a

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.580 
shooting really low PSI and keeping a
steady<00:01:35.569> air<00:01:36.380> pressure<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.229> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
steady air pressure on the on the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.099 
steady air pressure on the on the
airbrush<00:01:40.099> itself<00:01:40.549> really<00:01:40.969> helps<00:01:41.389> a<00:01:41.479> lot<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.810> a

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
airbrush itself really helps a lot and a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.389 
airbrush itself really helps a lot and a
clean<00:01:42.619> airbrush<00:01:43.009> also<00:01:43.429> helps<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.759> lot<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:45.399> just

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
clean airbrush also helps a lot to just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.099 
clean airbrush also helps a lot to just
kind<00:01:46.609> of<00:01:46.670> work<00:01:46.849> it<00:01:46.969> up<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.299> down<00:01:47.419> the<00:01:47.599> back<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
kind of work it up and down the back the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.629 
kind of work it up and down the back the
spine<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.529> the<00:01:48.590> bait<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:50.619> kind<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.709> I'll<00:01:52.429> get

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
spine of the bait and kind of I'll get

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.580 
spine of the bait and kind of I'll get
it<00:01:52.729> towards<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.299> around<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> eye<00:01:54.079> sockets

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
it towards the around the eye sockets

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.010 
it towards the around the eye sockets
towards<00:01:54.889> the<00:01:54.950> front<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.249> head<00:01:55.459> too<00:02:02.020> but

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
towards the front of the head too but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.080 
towards the front of the head too but
always<00:02:03.200> if<00:02:03.499> you<00:02:03.649> over<00:02:04.189> spray<00:02:04.489> with<00:02:04.700> your<00:02:04.849> black

it<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.940> real<00:02:22.940> quick<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.870> mean<00:02:25.120> take<00:02:26.120> your

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
it up real quick so I mean take your

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.140 
it up real quick so I mean take your
time<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.710> lower<00:02:28.370> air<00:02:28.550> pressure<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.060> know

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
time with a lower air pressure you know

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.750 
time with a lower air pressure you know
it's<00:02:29.300> gonna<00:02:29.420> take<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.660> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:29.960> longer<00:02:30.140> but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
it's gonna take a little bit longer but

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.400 
it's gonna take a little bit longer but
it<00:02:31.760> definitely<00:02:32.240> looks<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.960> lot<00:02:33.110> better<00:02:33.320> than

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
it definitely looks a lot better than

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.310 
it definitely looks a lot better than
the<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.980> long<00:02:34.160> run<00:02:35.020> instead<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.140> looking

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
the in the long run instead of looking

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.930 
the in the long run instead of looking
like<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.770> threw<00:02:36.950> some<00:02:37.160> paint<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.760> on

I'm<00:02:51.740> good<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:52.850> sometimes<00:02:53.330> two<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.780> shoot

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
I'm good then sometimes two and shoot

doesn't<00:02:58.160> usually<00:02:58.670> have<00:02:59.000> enough<00:03:00.550> psi<00:03:01.550> to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
doesn't usually have enough psi to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.850 
doesn't usually have enough psi to
sometimes<00:03:02.870> get<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.230> paint<00:03:03.500> flowing

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
sometimes get that paint flowing

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.580 
sometimes get that paint flowing
correctly<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.790> got<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> usually<00:03:06.140> spray

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
correctly so I got what I usually spray

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.620 
correctly so I got what I usually spray
on<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:07.760> see<00:03:07.940> me<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.240> there<00:03:08.450> was

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
on that you just see me do there was

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.140 
on that you just see me do there was
just<00:03:08.960> a<00:03:09.070> artists<00:03:10.070> notepad<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.550> got<00:03:10.790> hanging<00:03:11.060> on

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
just a artists notepad I got hanging on

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.750 
just a artists notepad I got hanging on
the<00:03:11.240> wall<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.420> I'll<00:03:11.900> test<00:03:12.230> spray<00:03:12.500> every<00:03:12.830> every

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the wall and I'll test spray every every

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.340 
the wall and I'll test spray every every
color<00:03:13.970> before<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.330> shoot<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> bait<00:03:15.140> I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
color before I shoot it on the bait I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.500 
color before I shoot it on the bait I
guess<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.340> sometimes<00:03:16.910> when<00:03:17.090> you're<00:03:17.210> shooting

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
guess but sometimes when you're shooting

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.020 
guess but sometimes when you're shooting
at<00:03:17.600> low<00:03:17.810> psi<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.440> need<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.490> kind<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.760> work<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
at low psi you need to kind of work the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.230 
at low psi you need to kind of work the
trigger<00:03:20.270> back<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.750> forth<00:03:20.990> with<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.440> know<00:03:22.240> to

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
trigger back and forth with you know to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.060 
trigger back and forth with you know to
get<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:24.010> get<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.160> paint<00:03:25.430> flowing<00:03:25.760> again<00:03:26.030> so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
get that get that paint flowing again so

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.230 
get that get that paint flowing again so
that's<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.280> that's<00:03:28.550> what<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:28.910> did<00:03:29.060> right

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
that's you that's what I just did right

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.900 
that's you that's what I just did right
there<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.720> um<00:03:30.440> instead<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.370> doing<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:31.760> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
there and um instead of doing it on the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.160 
there and um instead of doing it on the
bait<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.270> don't<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.540> don't<00:03:32.810> want<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.020> have<00:03:33.140> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
bait you don't you don't want to have a

bait you don't you don't want to have a
big<00:03:33.740> splatter<00:03:34.070> or<00:03:34.310> anything<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.880> base<00:03:35.090> so

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
big splatter or anything on the base so

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.710 
big splatter or anything on the base so
then<00:03:36.710> here<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.490> sepia<00:03:37.940> color<00:03:38.000> here<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> go

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
together and gives the white body part

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.590 
together and gives the white body part
of<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.140> little<00:04:48.800> more<00:04:48.980> shine<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.180> know<00:04:50.300> a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600

of it a little more shine and you know a
shimmer<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.830> then<00:04:52.010> all<00:04:52.420> works<00:04:53.420> really

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
shimmer so and then all works really

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.800 
shimmer so and then all works really
well<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:54.140> in<00:04:54.500> between<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:55.480> black<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.690> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
well like in between the black on the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.930 
well like in between the black on the
head<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.200> bait<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.710> then<00:04:58.370> where<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.730> got

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
head of the bait and then where you got

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.390 
head of the bait and then where you got
that<00:04:59.210> tan<00:04:59.510> behind<00:05:00.229> the<00:05:00.320> gill<00:05:00.530> plate<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.130> kind

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
that tan behind the gill plate it kind

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040 
that tan behind the gill plate it kind
of<00:05:01.460> really<00:05:01.669> helps<00:05:01.970> blend<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.390> together<00:05:02.570> so

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
of really helps blend that together so

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.260 
of really helps blend that together so
it<00:05:03.140> doesn't<00:05:03.440> look<00:05:03.530> like

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
it doesn't look like

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.659 
it doesn't look like
like<00:05:05.930> two<00:05:06.410> straight<00:05:06.770> lines<00:05:07.009> or<00:05:07.220> anything<00:05:07.430> like

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
like two straight lines or anything like

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.339 
like two straight lines or anything like
that<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:10.180> just<00:05:11.180> kind<00:05:11.419> of<00:05:11.479> fades<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.990> helps

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
that it just kind of fades that helps

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.469 
that it just kind of fades that helps
fade<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.770> black<00:05:13.069> into<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.580> white<00:05:14.210> better

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
fade that black into the white better

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:53.080 
fade that black into the white better
and<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.900> tan<00:05:15.800> into<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.250> white<00:05:16.460> better<00:05:16.699> too<00:05:17.000> so

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090
