we're going to switch back to our
material<00:01:38.620> we're<00:01:39.620> going<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.800> material<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.460> all

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
material we're going to material on all

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.170 
material we're going to material on all
of<00:01:40.790> them<00:01:43.930> right<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.190> basically<00:01:46.190> we<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:46.850> this

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
of them right so basically we have this

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.430 
of them right so basically we have this
now<00:01:47.450> we're<00:01:47.960> going<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.200> want<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.470> put<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.440> fence

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
now we're going to want to put the fence

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.700 
now we're going to want to put the fence
zero<00:01:52.160> one<00:01:52.340> B's<00:01:52.610> if<00:01:52.910> we<00:01:53.060> put<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> fence<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:54.500> B's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
zero one B's if we put the fence to B's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.210 
zero one B's if we put the fence to B's
you<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.580> see<00:01:55.910> like<00:01:56.540> they<00:01:57.530> don't<00:01:57.710> really<00:01:57.890> work

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
you can see like they don't really work

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.249 
you can see like they don't really work
that<00:01:58.400> well<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:59.090> these<00:01:59.210> stands<00:02:00.110> they

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
that well because of these stands they

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.050 
that well because of these stands they
have<00:02:00.410> at<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.619> bottom<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.790> we're<00:02:01.910> going<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
have at the bottom so we're going to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.109 
have at the bottom so we're going to
want<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.240> put<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.450> one<00:02:02.840> B<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.320> way<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:04.119> goes

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
want to put on one B so that way it goes

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.520 
want to put on one B so that way it goes
right<00:02:05.420> in<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.660> center<00:02:06.020> let's<00:02:06.200> see<00:02:06.320> if<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.440> can

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
right in the center let's see if I can

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.680 
right in the center let's see if I can
get<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.830> work<00:02:06.950> forever<00:02:07.220> there<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.610> go<00:02:07.700> so

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
get this to work forever there we go so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.749 
get this to work forever there we go so
we<00:02:08.899> have<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:09.290> that<00:02:09.530> one<00:02:10.340> thing<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.489> can<00:02:10.670> do

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
we have a like that one thing you can do

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.340 
we have a like that one thing you can do
is<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.830> fit<00:02:12.830> okay<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:14.180> because<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:15.140> made

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
is you can fit okay so because we made

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.690 
is you can fit okay so because we made
these<00:02:15.530> first<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.160> not<00:02:16.310> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.489> work<00:02:16.640> very

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
these first it's not going to work very

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.940 
these first it's not going to work very
well<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> sticks<00:02:18.800> out<00:02:18.920> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
well as you can see the sticks out of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.170 
well as you can see the sticks out of
one<00:02:19.160> side<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> little<00:02:19.489> bit<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:19.910> shouldn't

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
one side a little bit but that shouldn't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.400 
one side a little bit but that shouldn't
be<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.330> problem<00:02:20.360> you're<00:02:21.050> only<00:02:21.140> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.350> be

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
be a problem you're only going to be

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.810 
be a problem you're only going to be
using<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.830> side<00:02:22.070> really<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.459> look<00:02:22.610> down

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
using one side really to look down

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.580 
using one side really to look down
unless<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.540> multiple<00:02:23.900> people<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.560> even

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
unless you have multiple people but even

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.699 
unless you have multiple people but even
then<00:02:24.950> still<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:27.440> you're<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
then still so for this you're going to

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.740 
then still so for this you're going to
want<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> have<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:30.170> B's<00:02:31.450> I'm<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.600> going

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
want to have the one B's I'm just going

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.490 
want to have the one B's I'm just going
to<00:02:32.780> set<00:02:32.989> these<00:02:33.140> up<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.950> few<00:02:34.100> police's

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
to set these up and a few police's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.570 
to set these up and a few police's
actually<00:02:36.500> once<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:36.860> set<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.130> one<00:02:37.310> up<00:02:37.370> at<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
actually once one set this one up at the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.930 
actually once one set this one up at the
end

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
end

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.050 
end
now<00:02:39.720> these<00:02:40.380> fences<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:41.070> probably<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> most

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
now these fences are probably the most

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.550 
now these fences are probably the most
important<00:02:42.600> part<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> entire<00:02:43.140> base

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
important part of the entire base

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560 
important part of the entire base
because<00:02:44.010> these<00:02:44.190> fences<00:02:44.700> keep<00:02:45.150> people<00:02:45.420> from

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
because these fences keep people from

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.980 
because these fences keep people from
seeing<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.360> once<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.750> we're

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
seeing you so once we do that we're

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.090 
seeing you so once we do that we're
going<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.230> ahead<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.470> set<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.710> fading

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
going to go ahead and set up the fading

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.050 
going to go ahead and set up the fading
doors<00:02:51.440> gonna<00:02:52.440> do<00:02:52.710> fading<00:02:53.220> door<00:02:53.370> forgetting

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
doors gonna do fading door forgetting

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.390 
doors gonna do fading door forgetting
door<00:02:54.620> fading<00:02:55.620> door<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.890> are<00:02:55.950> gonna<00:02:56.130> want<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
door fading door and are gonna want to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280 
door fading door and are gonna want to
set<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.760> fading<00:02:57.300> doors<00:02:57.480> differently<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.260> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
set the fading doors differently so you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.540 
set the fading doors differently so you
can<00:02:58.500> get<00:02:58.620> out<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.800> your<00:02:58.860> base<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.430> just

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
can get out of your base or you can just

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.520 
can get out of your base or you can just
do<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> do<00:02:59.850> and<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> set<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.290> key

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
do what I do and have it set to one key

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
do what I do and have it set to one key
but<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:01.920> again<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.640> it'll<00:03:02.850> open

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
but then again if you do that it'll open

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.020 
but then again if you do that it'll open
up<00:03:03.180> all<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.540> at<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.690> same<00:03:03.870> time<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.030> then

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
up all of them at the same time and then

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.180 
up all of them at the same time and then
we're<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> want<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.930> put<00:03:07.470> keypad<00:03:07.860> I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
we're going to want to put keypad I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.070 
we're going to want to put keypad I
always<00:03:08.820> keep<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.150> safe<00:03:10.790> key<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.480> access<00:03:12.900> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
always keep it safe key for to access it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.290 
always keep it safe key for to access it
now<00:03:13.520> most<00:03:14.520> servers<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:16.460> at<00:03:17.460> least<00:03:17.790> five

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
now most servers have a at least five

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.410 
now most servers have a at least five
second<00:03:18.810> rule--<00:03:19.520> when<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.640> comes<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.120> your

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
second rule-- when it comes to your

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.740 
second rule-- when it comes to your
actual<00:03:21.690> keypad<00:03:22.470> whole<00:03:22.680> length<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.730> because<00:03:24.510> I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
actual keypad whole length but because I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.440 
actual keypad whole length but because I
have<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> motto<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.670> use<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.210> type<00:03:27.420> of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
have a motto that if I use this type of

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.290 
have a motto that if I use this type of
base<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.340> somebody<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.940> able<00:03:30.210> to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
base and somebody actually is able to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.000 
base and somebody actually is able to
kill<00:03:30.480> me<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:30.930> going<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.320> leave<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.710> ten

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
kill me I'm going to leave it on for ten

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.410 
kill me I'm going to leave it on for ten
seconds<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.880> get<00:03:33.060> inside<00:03:33.390> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
seconds just so they can get inside and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.060 
seconds just so they can get inside and
take<00:03:33.570> everything<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.170> because<00:03:34.740> if<00:03:34.920> I'm

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
take everything I have because if I'm

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.040 
take everything I have because if I'm
using<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.490> technique<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.180> I'm<00:03:36.360> doing<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
using this technique and I'm doing it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.900 
using this technique and I'm doing it
properly<00:03:37.320> there<00:03:38.070> shouldn't<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.520> single

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
properly there shouldn't be a single

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.990 
properly there shouldn't be a single
moment<00:03:39.210> when<00:03:39.300> somebody<00:03:39.630> gets<00:03:39.720> into<00:03:39.960> my<00:03:40.080> base

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
moment when somebody gets into my base

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.850 
moment when somebody gets into my base
so<00:03:42.000> I'm<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.500> I'm

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so I'm going to go and do that and I'm

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.960 
so I'm going to go and do that and I'm
going<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> use<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.250> materials<00:03:44.700> doesn't

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
going to use the materials doesn't

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.760 
going to use the materials doesn't
matter<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.240> material<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.690> use<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.560> put

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
matter what material you use just put

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.620 
matter what material you use just put
the<00:03:46.860> materials<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.880> fences<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.800> way

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
the materials on the fences so that way

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.510 
the materials on the fences so that way
they<00:03:51.630> can't<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.010> can<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:53.340> them

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
they can't see you but you can see them

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360 
they can't see you but you can see them
now<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.020> top<00:03:55.200> part<00:03:55.590> we're<00:03:55.980> going<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.160> put

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
now for the top part we're going to put

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.490 
now for the top part we're going to put
the<00:03:56.720> fences<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.270> easy<00:04:00.720> alternative<00:04:00.900> or

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the fences this is a easy alternative or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.590 
the fences this is a easy alternative or
you<00:04:01.740> can<00:04:01.950> use<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:03.560> one<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.970> fences<00:04:05.970> for<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
you can use the one be fences for the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.840 
you can use the one be fences for the
top<00:04:06.810> if<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.860> want<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.130> have<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.400> extra<00:04:08.700> level

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
top if you want to have that extra level

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.270 
top if you want to have that extra level
of<00:04:08.970> protection<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.660> topper<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.650> always

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
of protection a topper is always

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
of protection a topper is always
important<00:04:12.270> for<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.570> kind<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.870> base<00:04:13.050> because

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
important for this kind of base because

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.830 
important for this kind of base because
I've<00:04:13.890> seen<00:04:14.160> people<00:04:14.610> use<00:04:14.640> my<00:04:15.209> technique<00:04:15.630> before

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
I've seen people use my technique before

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.490 
I've seen people use my technique before
and<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:17.160> their<00:04:17.760> flaw<00:04:18.120> was<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.690> they<00:04:19.260> never

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
and what their flaw was is they never

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.240 
and what their flaw was is they never
put<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.950> topper<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:23.190> is

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
put a topper on it like this and this is

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.080 
put a topper on it like this and this is
extremely<00:04:24.060> important<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.960> servers<00:04:25.410> in<00:04:25.650> which

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
extremely important for servers in which

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.970 
extremely important for servers in which
they<00:04:27.090> allow<00:04:27.330> grenades<00:04:27.900> or<00:04:28.230> any<00:04:28.590> sort<00:04:28.919> of

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
they allow grenades or any sort of

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.970 
they allow grenades or any sort of
rocket-propelled<00:04:29.840> launchers<00:04:30.980> because

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
rocket-propelled launchers because

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.580 
rocket-propelled launchers because
people<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.370> just<00:04:32.520> shoot<00:04:32.700> right<00:04:32.760> up<00:04:32.970> out<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.360> it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
people can just shoot right up out of it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.290 
people can just shoot right up out of it
and<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:35.340> kind<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.610> skimp<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.910> little<00:04:36.120> bit<00:04:36.210> on

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
and just kind of skimp a little bit on

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.350 
and just kind of skimp a little bit on
this

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.050 

so<00:04:40.170> basically<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.550> people<00:04:41.670> can't

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
so basically do that so people can't

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.050 
so basically do that so people can't
throw<00:04:42.390> grenades<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:43.370> over<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> walls<00:04:44.700> because

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
throw grenades in over the walls because

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.640 
throw grenades in over the walls because
if<00:04:45.180> you're<00:04:45.300> doing<00:04:45.570> this<00:04:45.840> in<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.080> really<00:04:46.380> small

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
if you're doing this in a really small

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.560 
if you're doing this in a really small
room<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.670> don't<00:04:47.820> have<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.030> lot<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.300> room<00:04:48.540> to

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
room and you don't have a lot of room to

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.330 
room and you don't have a lot of room to
run<00:04:48.870> away<00:04:49.170> because<00:04:49.410> by<00:04:49.740> time<00:04:49.980> they're<00:04:50.130> innate

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
run away because by time they're innate

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.330 
run away because by time they're innate
in<00:04:50.780> m9k<00:04:51.780> gets<00:04:52.110> up<00:04:52.260> over<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.740> fence<00:04:52.920> it'll

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
in m9k gets up over the fence it'll

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.070 
in m9k gets up over the fence it'll
actually<00:04:53.460> go<00:04:53.760> off<00:04:53.940> within<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.330> matter<00:04:54.840> of<00:04:54.930> a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
actually go off within a matter of a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.290 
actually go off within a matter of a
second<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.620> half<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.760> we're<00:04:56.910> going<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.240> do

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
second and a half so we're going to do

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.030 
second and a half so we're going to do
that<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:58.140> your<00:04:58.260> choice<00:04:58.440> whether<00:04:58.680> or<00:04:58.830> not<00:04:58.920> you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
that it's your choice whether or not you

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.260 
that it's your choice whether or not you
want<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.220> put<00:04:59.340> them<00:04:59.460> at<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.640> allotted<00:04:59.850> I'm<00:05:00.060> just

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
want to put them at a allotted I'm just

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.140 
want to put them at a allotted I'm just
going<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.420> put<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.690> material<00:05:00.870> on<00:05:01.290> top<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:02.150> so

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
going to put the material on top and so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.450 
going to put the material on top and so
now<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.780> we<00:05:04.170> have<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.530> base<00:05:04.680> properly<00:05:05.220> set

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
now that we have the base properly set

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.520 
now that we have the base properly set
up<00:05:05.490> with<00:05:05.760> kill<00:05:06.000> boxes<00:05:06.540> what<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.110> usually<00:05:07.350> like

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
up with kill boxes what I usually like

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.260 
up with kill boxes what I usually like
to<00:05:07.680> do<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.130> I<00:05:08.250> like<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.460> keep<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.850> really<00:05:09.090> quiet

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
to do is I like to keep it really quiet

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.030 
to do is I like to keep it really quiet
I'll<00:05:09.660> let<00:05:09.900> them<00:05:10.020> go<00:05:10.230> through<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.620> door<00:05:10.830> and

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
I'll let them go through the door and

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.740 
I'll let them go through the door and
then<00:05:11.730> I'll<00:05:11.850> let<00:05:11.970> them<00:05:12.120> go<00:05:12.270> through<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.540> first

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
then I'll let them go through the first

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.270 
then I'll let them go through the first
fading<00:05:13.110> door<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.530> then<00:05:13.710> I'll<00:05:13.830> wait<00:05:14.040> till

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
fading door and then I'll wait till

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.950 
fading door and then I'll wait till
they're<00:05:14.400> stuck<00:05:14.760> in<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.120> second<00:05:15.480> fading<00:05:15.810> door

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
they're stuck in the second fading door

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.560 
they're stuck in the second fading door
which<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.680> what<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.890> call<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.310> kill<00:05:17.580> box<00:05:17.820> which<00:05:18.390> is

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
which is what I call a kill box which is

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.000 
which is what I call a kill box which is
right<00:05:18.840> in<00:05:18.870> between<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.410> spot<00:05:19.620> where<00:05:19.890> they

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
right in between the spot where they

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.890 
right in between the spot where they
can't<00:05:20.280> get<00:05:20.460> out<00:05:20.490> no<00:05:20.730> matter<00:05:20.910> what<00:05:21.000> they<00:05:21.420> do<00:05:21.480> and

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
can't get out no matter what they do and

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.110 
can't get out no matter what they do and
that<00:05:22.470> is<00:05:22.620> when<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.890> kill<00:05:23.430> them<00:05:23.610> because<00:05:23.730> if

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
that is when I just kill them because if

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.150 
that is when I just kill them because if
you<00:05:24.330> if<00:05:24.630> they're<00:05:25.140> like<00:05:25.590> picking<00:05:25.830> into<00:05:26.010> this

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
you if they're like picking into this

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.260 
you if they're like picking into this
and<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.520> come<00:05:26.640> over<00:05:26.760> here<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.120> start

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
and you come over here and you start

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.090 
and you come over here and you start
shooting<00:05:27.570> down<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.110> hallway<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.860> miss

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
shooting down this hallway and you miss

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.470 
shooting down this hallway and you miss
a<00:05:29.130> shot<00:05:29.430> or<00:05:29.580> two<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:29.970> they're<00:05:30.150> able<00:05:30.300> to

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
a shot or two and they're able to

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.390 
a shot or two and they're able to
realize<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.260> they're<00:05:31.410> screwed<00:05:31.980> and<00:05:32.220> they

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
realize that they're screwed and they

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.470 
realize that they're screwed and they
run<00:05:32.610> out<00:05:32.640> and<00:05:32.790> you're<00:05:32.970> going<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.210> miss<00:05:33.360> the
