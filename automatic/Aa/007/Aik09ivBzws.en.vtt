00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
worry about it but I found myself really

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
worry about it but I found myself really
getting<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.500> almost<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.430> everyday<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
getting out almost about everyday and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
getting out almost about everyday and
and<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.350> though<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:13.799> importantly<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and more so though more importantly I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
and more so though more importantly I
found<00:01:14.670> myself<00:01:14.760> eating<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:16.530> once<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
found myself eating out now about once a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
found myself eating out now about once a
day<00:01:17.280> once<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.150> awhile<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.360> skip<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.470> at

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
day once in awhile I skip but it's at

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
day once in awhile I skip but it's at
least<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:20.189> five<00:01:20.430> times<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> week<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
least about five times a week now

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960 
least about five times a week now
sometimes<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.670> thought<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
sometimes more and so I thought this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
sometimes more and so I thought this
would<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.390> important<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.280> about

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
would be really important because about

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
would be really important because about
it's<00:01:26.729> been<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.270> months<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> I've
