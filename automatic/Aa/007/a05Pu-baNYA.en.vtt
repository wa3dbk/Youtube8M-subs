00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.170
 it likes music it has the piano 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.120
 especially like in one night 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.010
 It was already very late about two o'clock 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 I was up in the morning and made it 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.650
 Through the internet while listening to music 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.580
 Heard it was a night like any other 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 but then finally on one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 interesting video on youtube with the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 title easiest song to you on the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 playing the piano can still learn it 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 tonight 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 i cant play a lot of piano but 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.169
 I had it a few years ago 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.759
 trying to learn as mine now 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.290
 Grandmother deceased me the piano 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 that had always been in her 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 living room it is a very old one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.930
 piano from the year 1928 but always 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.580
 still in good condition 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 I decided to do that in the video 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.420
 to look how easy it was this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.519
 to learn song 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.409
 in the video, white hands played one 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.339
 ancient melody around the middle 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.129
 key around 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.089
 the song was really easy though 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.470
 something about him was strange 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.989
 nerve-wracking but I liked it 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 somehow I remembered that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.060
 Chords and notes got up and left 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.159
 the room on the way to the piano 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.899
 walk was pretty dark 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.079
 only a small nightlight flickered 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.579
 a candle in the corner i walked slowly 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.289
 me along a wall groping the aisle 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.920
 down 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.079
 somewhere here has the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.759
 be found light switch 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.229
 the gang felt light but me 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.959
 felt a little uncomfortable 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.630
 It seemed like a little moment 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.899
 Is if I saw something? 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 small and fine not how you look 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.789
 but introduces a hiss or a soul 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.649
 not like a person but it was 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.879
 small and probably only mine 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.959
 fantasy team to play a prank 

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:51.119
 I tried to move on to the room 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.060
 the piano stood this room was 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.319
 just as dark our high ceilings 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 you can never see in the dark 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.000
 but the darkness did not seem 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 to be natural a kind of darkness 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.219
 which you can practically feel already 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.229
 I switched on the small lamp next to the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.629
 piano on opened the keys and ceiling 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459
 I play some melodies to practice 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.049
 put my foot on while I was playing 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 a pedal that echoes the whole thing 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.700
 lent and almost sounded like one 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.970
 exhale constantly 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.800
 exhale I stopped and still heard 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.489
 once 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 silence an eerie silence 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.420
 I started the song is in the video too 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.640
 playing the notes all fit well 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 together I could still closely 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.700
 the keys I have to play 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.130
 recall 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.750
 he was very simple actually could 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.849
 someone will play this song without him 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.730
 would realize that it was actually a 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.230
 song is 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.049
 I played to the end and leaned against it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.349
 Satisfied back suddenly I stopped 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.959
 to sound this melody out of the corridor 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.610
 how could that be I got up and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.290
 Gently went out of the room and then in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.690
 my room because it sounds like 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 the music would come from there 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.319
 I saw my computer this video 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.160
 played again 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.290
 he probably just got new 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.650
 loaded 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.269
 then I heard that melody again 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.569
 this time she arrived from the piano 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.930
 I was still staring at him 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.230
 fright 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 I could not move slowly 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.500
 I went then when I something again 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.180
 had calmed down the dark passage in 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.120
 The direction of music is the dark one 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.470
 the room sounded the piano always played 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.970
 even this bloodcurdling melody 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.040
 I reached the corner of the me that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.569
 piano could draw took all 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.200
 Mut together and turned around and 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.200
 nachzuschauen 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.159
 Suddenly the music stopped and there was 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.470
 not to be seen at first sight 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:53.879
 When I looked closer, I saw something 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.489
 something small skins up something white 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.700
 that stood in the dark corner and me 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.000
 smiled it whispered in one 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.419
 Distorted and quiet sound play 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.419
 one more
