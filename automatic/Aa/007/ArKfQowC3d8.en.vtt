00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
box the same but they start putting

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.800 
box the same but they start putting
someone<00:03:14.470> limited's<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.430> box<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.060> there's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
someone limited's in this box so there's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.020 
someone limited's in this box so there's
a<00:03:16.900> chance<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.290> could<00:03:17.320> be<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> shadowless<00:03:18.100> chance

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
a chance it could be a shadowless chance

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.120 
a chance it could be a shadowless chance
it<00:03:19.180> could<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.450> not<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:20.200> i<00:03:20.410> have<00:03:20.620> three<00:03:21.010> of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
it could be not but i have three of

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.970 
it could be not but i have three of
these<00:03:21.220> i<00:03:21.520> think<00:03:21.790> three<00:03:22.480> or<00:03:22.510> four<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.930> them<00:03:23.050> with

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
these i think three or four of them with

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.860 
these i think three or four of them with
the<00:03:24.100> green<00:03:24.310> wing<00:03:24.490> Charizard<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.630> there's<00:03:25.780> a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
the green wing Charizard so there's a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.970 
the green wing Charizard so there's a
chance<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.320> know<00:03:26.380> one<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.620> them<00:03:26.770> could<00:03:26.950> be

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
chance you know one of them could be

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.680 
chance you know one of them could be
shadowless<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> might<00:03:27.940> open<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.270> couple<00:03:28.630> of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
shadowless so I might open a couple of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.240 
shadowless so I might open a couple of
those<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.170> take<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.440> chance<00:03:29.680> even

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
those just to take the chance even

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.650 
those just to take the chance even
though<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:30.970> don't<00:03:31.240> care<00:03:31.510> because

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
