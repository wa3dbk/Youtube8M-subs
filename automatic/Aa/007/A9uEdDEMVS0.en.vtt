on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.200 
on
ox2<00:02:13.380> anything<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.980> was<00:02:14.190> alive<00:02:14.490> before<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
ox2 anything that was alive before I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.240 
ox2 anything that was alive before I
know<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.840> worms<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.560> still<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> think

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.470 
know it's just worms but still I think
it<00:02:17.400> might<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.550> kind<00:02:17.820> of<00:02:17.850> cool<00:02:18.000> i'll<00:02:18.270> probably

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it might be kind of cool i'll probably

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780 
it might be kind of cool i'll probably
show<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:18.990> set<00:02:19.260> them<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.860> maybe<00:02:20.580> I'll

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
show how I set them up and maybe I'll

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.520
