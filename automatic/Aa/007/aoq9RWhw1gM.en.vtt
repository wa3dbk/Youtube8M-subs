it's fairly standard I'll go to this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.460 
it's fairly standard I'll go to this
black<00:02:45.420> thing<00:02:45.800> wherever<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.410> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
black thing wherever it is just so you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.250 
black thing wherever it is just so you
can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.100> bit<00:02:50.220> nicer<00:02:54.260> pretty

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
can see a little bit nicer pretty

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.880 
can see a little bit nicer pretty
standard

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
standard

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.290 
standard
about<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.030> uh<00:02:58.370> thick<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> case<00:02:59.880> itself

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
about it is uh thick is the case itself

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.990 
about it is uh thick is the case itself
so<00:03:00.540> probably<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.370> almost<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:02.580> thick<00:03:02.760> as<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
so probably about almost as thick as the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.699 
so probably about almost as thick as the
actual<00:03:03.269> camera<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.690> fairly<00:03:07.320> decent

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
actual camera and it's fairly decent

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.920 
actual camera and it's fairly decent
length<00:03:08.150> probably<00:03:09.150> fit<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.450> around<00:03:09.720> your

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
length probably fit this around your

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.729 
length probably fit this around your
shoulder<00:03:10.709> fairly<00:03:11.130> easily<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:12.470> yeah<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.680> is

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
shoulder fairly easily and yeah this is

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.830 
shoulder fairly easily and yeah this is
my<00:03:13.890> unboxing<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.209> would<00:03:15.360> love<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.660> show

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
unfortunately seems my pre-order it's
