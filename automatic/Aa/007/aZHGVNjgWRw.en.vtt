hello this is James the creator of Mac
caching<00:00:05.670> now<00:00:06.390> I'm<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.690> come<00:00:06.930> out<00:00:07.020> with

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
caching now I'm about to come out with

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.140 
caching now I'm about to come out with
version<00:00:07.589> 1<00:00:07.740> point<00:00:07.980> 0<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.340> thought<00:00:08.519> I'd<00:00:08.670> take

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
version 1 point 0 and I thought I'd take

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.549 
version 1 point 0 and I thought I'd take
a<00:00:09.210> few<00:00:09.360> minutes<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.840> show<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.290> some<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
a few minutes and show you some of the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.560 
a few minutes and show you some of the
new<00:00:10.679> features<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.280> coming<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
new features that are coming so the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.480 
new features that are coming so the
first<00:00:12.750> thing<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.990> want<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> show<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
first thing I want to show off is that I

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.250 
first thing I want to show off is that I
now<00:00:14.820> support<00:00:15.240> zip<00:00:15.480> files<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.550> import<00:00:17.550> type

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
now support zip files as a import type

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.800 
now support zip files as a import type
so<00:00:19.260> when<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> download<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.420> pocket<00:00:21.420> query<00:00:21.630> for

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so when you download a pocket query for

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.269 
so when you download a pocket query for
example<00:00:22.230> when<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> save<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> zip<00:00:23.100> file<00:00:23.250> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
example when you save the zip file to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.310 
example when you save the zip file to
your<00:00:23.550> computer<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.779> take<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> drag

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
your computer you can just take and drag

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980 
your computer you can just take and drag
it<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:25.560> Mac<00:00:25.830> caching<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> first

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it into Mac caching so one of the first

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.450 
it into Mac caching so one of the first
things<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.260> might<00:00:28.380> notice<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.859> importing

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
things you might notice is importing

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.710 
things you might notice is importing
will<00:00:29.580> take<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.150> longer<00:00:30.330> than<00:00:30.599> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
will take a little bit longer than it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.170 
will take a little bit longer than it
used<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> brand-new<00:00:32.550> back<00:00:32.820> end<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
used to there's a brand-new back end of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
used to there's a brand-new back end of
mac<00:00:33.300> caching<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> new<00:00:34.590> back<00:00:34.800> one

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
mac caching and one of the new back one

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.709 
mac caching and one of the new back one
of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> advantages<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.090> new<00:00:36.270> back<00:00:36.450> end

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
of the advantages of this new back end

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.770 
of the advantages of this new back end
is<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:37.980> store<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.629> log

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is that I now store all of the log

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560 
is that I now store all of the log
information<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.700> why<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> imports

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
information and so that's why I imports

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
information and so that's why I imports
will<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:43.020> longer<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> logs<00:00:44.850> will

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
will take a little longer the logs will

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
will take a little longer the logs will
be<00:00:45.149> exported<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.809> two<00:00:46.469> things<00:00:46.500> cash<00:00:47.370> mate<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
be exported on two things cash mate and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.459 
be exported on two things cash mate and
one<00:00:48.420> other<00:00:48.510> feature<00:00:48.780> I'll<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> I'll<00:00:49.289> show

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
one other feature I'll that I'll show

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
one other feature I'll that I'll show
you<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.920> minute<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.719> thing<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you in just a minute so one thing you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
you in just a minute so one thing you
might<00:00:52.079> notice<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.309> off<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> bat

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
might notice is that right off the bat

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
might notice is that right off the bat
Matt<00:00:54.120> caching<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.870> faster<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.440> much

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
Matt caching is much faster and much

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
Matt caching is much faster and much
more<00:00:55.890> responsive<00:00:56.250> than<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.730> used<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.120> for

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
more responsive than it used to be for

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
more responsive than it used to be for
example<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.320> type<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.800> search<00:00:58.980> term<00:00:59.280> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
example when i type in a search term on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.479 
example when i type in a search term on
the<00:01:00.329> top<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> screen<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.530> let's<00:01:02.280> say<00:01:02.460> i

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the top of the screen here let's say i

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.620 
the top of the screen here let's say i
type<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.000> GC<00:01:03.570> 1<00:01:04.369> which<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.580> show<00:01:05.850> me<00:01:06.000> where<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
type in GC 1 which will show me where in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.280 
type in GC 1 which will show me where in
any<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> fields<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.729> caches<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
any of the fields for your caches if the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980 
any of the fields for your caches if the
letters<00:01:10.619> G<00:01:10.830> c1<00:01:11.040> show<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.299> shows<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
letters G c1 show up that shows up in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
letters G c1 show up that shows up in
the<00:01:13.080> listing<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:14.040> 126<00:01:14.909> caches

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the listing now and there's 126 caches

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
the listing now and there's 126 caches
that<00:01:15.360> contain<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that contain this another one I can

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
that contain this another one I can
think<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.850> pound<00:01:18.240> sign<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.200> pound

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
think of is like pound sign one or pound

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.340 
think of is like pound sign one or pound
sign<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.890> pound<00:01:20.340> sign<00:01:20.580> three<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:22.020> kinds<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sign to pound sign three those kinds of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
sign to pound sign three those kinds of
things<00:01:22.470> usually<00:01:22.740> series<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.670> labeled<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
things usually series will be labeled in

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.100 
things usually series will be labeled in
such<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> way<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.490> another<00:01:27.330> way<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> search<00:01:28.080> for

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
such a way now another way to search for

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100 
such a way now another way to search for
the<00:01:28.380> cash<00:01:28.590> listing<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> by<00:01:29.670> creating<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.720> smart

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the cash listing is by creating a smart

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660 
the cash listing is by creating a smart
cache<00:01:31.350> list<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:32.040> you'll<00:01:32.189> notice<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
cache list what you'll notice is that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780 
cache list what you'll notice is that
purple<00:01:33.299> means<00:01:33.720> smart<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> blue<00:01:35.009> means<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
purple means smart and blue means I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
purple means smart and blue means I
don't<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.990> smart<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.640> up

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
don't know not so smart so if I go up

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.710 
don't know not so smart so if I go up
here<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> file<00:01:39.329> new<00:01:39.840> smart<00:01:40.320> cache<00:01:41.130> list<00:01:41.720> we

here to file new smart cache list we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
here to file new smart cache list we
have<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> new<00:01:43.049> window<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:44.340> window<00:01:44.399> has<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
number of fields that you can go and say

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
number of fields that you can go and say
I<00:01:47.159> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.759> things<00:01:47.939> within<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I want to look for things within that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
I want to look for things within that
field<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.259> example<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
field so for example if I want it to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.340 
field so for example if I want it to
look<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.270> any<00:01:51.570> caches<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.290> contain<00:01:52.860> GC<00:01:53.820> 1<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
look for any caches that contain GC 1 I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
look for any caches that contain GC 1 I
could<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.729> say<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
could do it this way and then say I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
could do it this way and then say I
wanted<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> only<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.140> caches<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> are

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wanted to only get this caches that are

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
wanted to only get this caches that are
microbes<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> add<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.079> line<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.590> want

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
microbes so then I can add a line I want

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.330 
microbes so then I can add a line I want
when<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.180> size<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:05.329> micro<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.129> I'll

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
when the size is micro and then I'll

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390 
when the size is micro and then I'll
undo<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.789> limit<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.239> say<00:02:09.750> okay<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> if<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.370> go

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
undo this limit and say okay so if I go

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
undo this limit and say okay so if I go
to<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.120> when<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.780> look<00:02:12.870> through<00:02:13.170> here
