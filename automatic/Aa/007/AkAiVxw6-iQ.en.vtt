then all of a sudden John threw me a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
then all of a sudden John threw me a
huge<00:01:29.579> curveball<00:01:29.850> thinking<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> phone

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
huge curveball thinking about the phone

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
huge curveball thinking about the phone
our<00:01:30.960> stars<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.040> feel<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
our stars is it actually made me feel I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
our stars is it actually made me feel I
know<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> might<00:01:32.820> sound<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.299> weird<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
know that might sound a little weird but

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.120 
know that might sound a little weird but
it<00:01:34.680> were<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it were as if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
it were as if
I<00:01:35.310> myself<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.090> through<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.930> these

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I myself was going through what these

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.630 
I myself was going through what these
characters<00:01:37.530> were<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.860> through<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.280> think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
characters were going through I think

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.859 
characters were going through I think
that's<00:01:38.880> something<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.360> hard<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that's something that's very hard to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
that's something that's very hard to
achieve<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.439> an<00:01:40.590> author<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.159> John<00:01:41.430> did<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
achieve as an author but John did that I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
achieve as an author but John did that I
honestly<00:01:42.299> can't<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.990> thing<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
honestly can't think of one thing I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
honestly can't think of one thing I
