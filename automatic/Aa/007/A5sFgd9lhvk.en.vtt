you know not spawn trapping people even
though<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.050> could<00:02:16.260> definitely<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.890> on

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
though you could definitely do it on

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.130 
though you could definitely do it on
that<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.489> well<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.330> was<00:02:18.420> more<00:02:18.569> people<00:02:18.900> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140

camping<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.239> whole<00:02:21.390> time<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.380> kind<00:02:22.560> of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
camping the whole time you know kind of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
camping the whole time you know kind of
a<00:02:22.800> really<00:02:23.280> abusing<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.849> upper<00:02:24.330> level<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a really abusing that upper level you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.780 
a really abusing that upper level you
know<00:02:24.959> having<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> higher<00:02:25.650> ground<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.670> that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
know having the higher ground but that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
know having the higher ground but that
but<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.209> believe<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.410> exact

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
but I believe I don't know the exact

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.770 
but I believe I don't know the exact
shinier<00:02:29.370> changes<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.030> did<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.330> trenches

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
shinier changes they did for trenches

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
shinier changes they did for trenches
but<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.319> definitely<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.099> they<00:02:32.430> have

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
but I definitely know that they have

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.570 
but I definitely know that they have
some<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.209> know<00:02:33.239> new<00:02:33.720> areas<00:02:34.319> linked<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
some you know new areas linked so that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.790 
some you know new areas linked so that
you<00:02:35.940> know<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.120> can't<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.840> camp<00:02:37.530> up<00:02:37.769> there

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you know you can't really camp up there

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.920 
you know you can't really camp up there
anymore<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.030> little<00:02:39.300> but<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
anymore and it's a little but it's a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.990 
anymore and it's a little but it's a
little<00:02:40.110> bit<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.410> secure<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.430> it's

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
little bit more secure you know so it's

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.089 
little bit more secure you know so it's
not<00:02:42.209> such<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> cheap<00:02:42.780> map<00:02:43.019> which<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.709> definitely

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
not such a cheap map which is definitely

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.470 
not such a cheap map which is definitely
a<00:02:44.160> great<00:02:44.370> thing<00:02:44.610> I'm<00:02:44.940> actually<00:02:45.150> really

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
