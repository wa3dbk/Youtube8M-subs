00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 besides the language but I'm here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 in mine going the 8 to teach one thing 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.290
 which can help many who think 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.450
 Your computer waddle has a counter is 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.079
 You have already realized that you know that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.180
 customize your computer and you do not have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:53.899
 a classic mode has these modes here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 for example and if it appears here 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.570
 these very good things played and the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 from this it has returned to normal that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.189
 from this a concept on the internet 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.140
 explaining how to create themes for windows 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:18.990
 I was created my theme only you can 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.259
 see here and here 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 when you click here 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.710
 will be one or another high theme 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.630
 contrast with the wii own load 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.390
 and colorful 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 You can change the colors here at ease. 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.930
 several million colors used here 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.759
 so then I thought it would be that the system 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:54.180
 high contrast decreases what is used in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.100
 yes branch but decreases enough perhaps 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 that's what I did, I'm going 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.750
 make it available here for you since 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.500
 rar classic that does not have 28 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.979
 but you can add with it I 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.780
 I did the first you get it click 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.620
 on here 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 to extract 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.849
 to open the local disk 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.530
 if I scroll to the windows install 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:32.870
 Windows 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 we open here is and solve sears in spam 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.720
 accidents 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.090
 exactly here I'm going to paste this one here 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.930
 For you guys, you can take this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.370
 address pressing here met and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.560
 Opening here I feel ready and have the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.510
 themes 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.280
 I'll be around here to make a mistake 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.870
 again denied access to then the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 cat and put it here ready 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.500
 drawing absent minded classic here after 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.540
 of extracted class 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 you normally click with the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:19.609
 right click and customize 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:25.769
 calm classic a little wait a little 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:29.400
 few minutes and ready your windows is 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.650
 totally in classic mode is classic 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.319
 they can see that it was much more 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.090
 sinister well more way too well 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.799
 created so far along these stops 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.430
 they look really cool 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:50.400
 good classic mode even if there all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.319
 same as the classic mode even a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.299
 very cool, right? 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:00.870
 I congratulate you for creating 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:02.879
 this but I feel so so so good just 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.730
 to create this is a thing makes any 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.579
 one can do at least in my vision 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.910
 but it is this personal that only to teach the 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:15.120
 How are you, the classic theme in 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 windows 8 to slow down the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.570
 slowed down is to decrease the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.380
 Windows speed to have more 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.450
 space more things in the cpu 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.450
 but this is personal 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.450
 Thanks and until the next master video
