 hello to all so here is the following of 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.209
 the collection and we arrived at 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.570
 the super nathan of water and so we go 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.000
 start right now and we'll 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.700
 start with the console by the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.180
 consoles well I'll introduce the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.350
 more opaque super nintendo that I have in 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.270
 the collection so the pack so the cons 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.570
 contrite and it had bugs 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.409
 then another very nice pack too 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.489
