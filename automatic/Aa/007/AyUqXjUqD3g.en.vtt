00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.580 
poses you know they can move around they
can't<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.790> much<00:00:35.820> beyond<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.590> these

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
can't really do much beyond that these

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
how it's supposed to be held whether

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
how it's supposed to be held whether
it's<00:02:17.549> supposed<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.150> upside<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.599> like

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
it's supposed to be upside down like

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.849 
it's supposed to be upside down like
that<00:02:19.049> or<00:02:20.180> right-side<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.569> can<00:02:22.170> squeeze<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
that or right-side up I can squeeze it

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.970 
that or right-side up I can squeeze it
in<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:24.109> which<00:02:25.109> is<00:02:25.140> why<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.409> assumed<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.859> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
in there which is why I assumed that it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.229 
in there which is why I assumed that it
was<00:02:26.129> supposed<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.519> be<00:02:26.609> upside<00:02:26.879> down<00:02:26.939> just

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
was supposed to be upside down just

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.030 
was supposed to be upside down just
because<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.540> doesn't<00:02:27.810> fit<00:02:28.079> like<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.709> that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
because it doesn't fit like this that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.660 
because it doesn't fit like this that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
different configurations even like some

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.500 
different configurations even like some
vehicles<00:05:44.340> they<00:05:44.550> have<00:05:44.580> like<00:05:44.820> three<00:05:45.060> figures

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
see more of them but I have a feeling

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.540 
see more of them but I have a feeling
that<00:05:54.780> Fisher<00:05:55.170> Price<00:05:55.380> even<00:05:55.860> if<00:05:55.950> its<00:05:56.070> success

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
that Fisher Price even if its success

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.150 
that Fisher Price even if its success
will<00:05:56.760> probably<00:05:57.240> just<00:05:57.480> stick<00:05:58.380> with<00:05:58.560> up<00:05:58.740> selling

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
will probably just stick with up selling

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.850 
will probably just stick with up selling
the<00:05:59.370> vehicles<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:01.020> other<00:06:01.170> stuff<00:06:01.470> instead

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
the vehicles and the other stuff instead

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.710 
the vehicles and the other stuff instead
of<00:06:01.920> giving<00:06:02.100> us<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.310> huge<00:06:02.700> variety<00:06:03.000> in<00:06:03.300> figures

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
of giving us a huge variety in figures

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.140 
of giving us a huge variety in figures
the<00:06:04.650> guy<00:06:04.770> doubt<00:06:05.010> we'll<00:06:05.160> ever<00:06:05.250> see<00:06:05.610> even<00:06:06.030> like
