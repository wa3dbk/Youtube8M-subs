start once you collect a bunch of the to
be<00:02:20.390> even<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.110> two<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.379> three<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.680> them<00:02:22.209> if<00:02:23.209> you

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
be even it's two or three of them if you

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.520 
be even it's two or three of them if you
want<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.569> build<00:02:23.659> an<00:02:23.780> original<00:02:24.170> deck<00:02:24.319> that's

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
want to build an original deck that's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.349 
want to build an original deck that's
yours<00:02:24.829> you<00:02:25.069> can't<00:02:25.370> really<00:02:25.549> just<00:02:25.790> copy<00:02:26.030> someone

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
yours you can't really just copy someone

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:26.920 
yours you can't really just copy someone
else's<00:02:26.420> deck

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
else's deck

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.030 
else's deck
that's<00:02:27.319> not<00:02:27.590> yours<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.750> take<00:02:30.079> punch<00:02:30.590> cards

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that's not yours so you take punch cards

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.910 
that's not yours so you take punch cards
you<00:02:32.000> make<00:02:32.150> big<00:02:32.480> list<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.959> cards<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.799> you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
you make big list of cards and then you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.429 
you make big list of cards and then you
start<00:02:34.129> selecting<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.870> basically<00:02:36.170> let<00:02:36.260> me<00:02:36.319> do

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
start selecting so basically let me do

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.690 
start selecting so basically let me do
is<00:02:36.530> I'm<00:02:36.590> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.769> be<00:02:37.010> building<00:02:37.189> the<00:02:37.370> stick

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
is I'm going to be building the stick

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.660 
is I'm going to be building the stick
from<00:02:38.239> scratch<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.129> you<00:02:40.129> didn't<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.549> first

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
from scratch so you didn't see the first

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.009 
from scratch so you didn't see the first
step<00:02:40.939> which<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.629> through<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> bunch

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
step which was just go through a bunch

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.660 
step which was just go through a bunch
of<00:02:42.170> random<00:02:42.500> deck<00:02:42.620> lists<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:42.980> find<00:02:43.129> cool<00:02:43.340> cards

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
of random deck lists and find cool cards

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.959 
of random deck lists and find cool cards
and<00:02:43.879> throw<00:02:44.840> them<00:02:44.900> at<00:02:44.989> w<00:02:45.260> pile<00:02:45.530> along<00:02:46.219> with<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
and throw them at w pile along with the

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.970 
and throw them at w pile along with the
cards<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.299> know<00:02:47.480> already<00:02:47.719> but<00:02:47.989> if<00:02:48.859> you're

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
cards you know already but if you're

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.459 
cards you know already but if you're
newer<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.459> building<00:02:50.299> EDH<00:02:50.629> this<00:02:51.319> is

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:51.469 
newer to the building EDH this is

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.830 
newer to the building EDH this is
definitely<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> way<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.159> go<00:02:52.389> someone<00:02:53.389> like<00:02:53.689> me

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
definitely the way to go someone like me

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.390 
definitely the way to go someone like me
who's<00:02:53.959> been<00:02:54.049> playing<00:02:54.170> eh<00:02:54.469> a<00:02:54.620> while<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.189> knows

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
a lot of the old cards I didn't

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.319 
a lot of the old cards I didn't
necessarily<00:02:57.349> need<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.159> it<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.060> find<00:02:59.239> a

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
necessarily need to do it but you find a

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.379 
necessarily need to do it but you find a
lot<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.510> really<00:02:59.810> cool<00:02:59.840> stuff<00:03:00.139> if<00:03:00.439> you<00:03:00.560> do<00:03:01.389> so

as of now other hopefully in during the
break<00:03:07.579> times<00:03:07.849> I'll<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.329> able<00:03:08.359> to<00:03:08.599> take<00:03:09.019> more

really neat idea so I'm going to post
below<00:03:20.689> this<00:03:21.409> deck<00:03:21.469> list<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:22.700> same<00:03:22.939> thing<00:03:23.209> so

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
below this deck list the same thing so

below this deck list the same thing so
you<00:03:23.510> guys<00:03:23.689> can<00:03:23.840> see<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.079> amount<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.290> costs<00:03:24.709> or

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
you guys can see the amount of costs or

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.089 
you guys can see the amount of costs or
approximate<00:03:25.609> matta<00:03:25.760> cost<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.480> order<00:03:27.099> that's

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
approximate matta cost in order that's

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.199 
approximate matta cost in order that's
for<00:03:28.280> people<00:03:28.370> who've<00:03:28.579> been<00:03:28.730> playing<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:29.000> eh<00:03:29.120> a
