I've had a lot of requests for the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.779 
I've had a lot of requests for the
strumming<00:00:20.520> part<00:00:20.790> after<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.360> main<00:00:21.570> intro<00:00:22.789> I'll

strumming part after the main intro I'll
cover<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.720> transition<00:00:25.590> strumming<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.369> the

next tutorial this will be where this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
next tutorial this will be where this
tutorial<00:00:31.230> will<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.380> working<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
tutorial will be working on just the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.820 
tutorial will be working on just the
very<00:00:32.519> basic<00:00:32.940> strumming<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.350> used<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
very basic strumming and it's used in a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.110 
very basic strumming and it's used in a
couple<00:00:35.190> places<00:00:35.220> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> song<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.940> lot

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
couple places in the song the it's a lot

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640 
couple places in the song the it's a lot
of<00:00:39.239> right-hand<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.170> there's<00:00:40.440> some

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
of right-hand and there's some

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.960 
of right-hand and there's some
coordination<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.449> note<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.970> in

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
coordination with this note here in

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.060 
coordination with this note here in
general<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.019> sounds<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.559> I'll<00:00:46.799> first

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
general what it sounds like I'll first

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.579 
general what it sounds like I'll first
play<00:00:47.339> it<00:00:47.570> hopefully<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.900> right<00:00:49.049> speed<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
play it hopefully at the right speed and

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.770 
play it hopefully at the right speed and
then<00:00:50.430> we'll<00:00:50.640> break<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:50.970> down<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.449> it'll

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
then we'll break it down because it'll

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.450 
then we'll break it down because it'll
be<00:00:51.839> hard<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.080> see<00:00:52.290> my<00:00:52.409> right<00:00:52.619> hand<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
be hard to see my right hand on the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479 
be hard to see my right hand on the
video<00:00:54.059> given<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> frame<00:00:55.049> rate<00:00:55.229> but<00:00:55.489> we're

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
video given the frame rate but we're

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:08.529 
video given the frame rate but we're
going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.970> breaking<00:00:57.150> this<00:00:57.479> down

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.389 

now<00:01:09.539> I'm<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> try<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.009> break<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> down

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
now I'm going to try to break this down

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.490 
now I'm going to try to break this down
slowly<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.990> used<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> playing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
slowly I'm actually just used to playing

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
slowly I'm actually just used to playing
it<00:01:13.680> fast<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.280> slow<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> might<00:01:15.240> make<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it fast and not slow so I might make a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
it fast and not slow so I might make a
couple<00:01:15.689> mistakes<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.590> along

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
couple mistakes as I go along

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.459 
couple mistakes as I go along
but<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> general<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.200> this

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
but in general it's something like this

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.429 
but in general it's something like this
with<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:21.149> third<00:01:21.360> finger<00:01:21.719> down<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.170> twelfth

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
with the third finger down the twelfth

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
with the third finger down the twelfth
fret<00:01:22.530> third<00:01:22.860> string<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.819> down<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
fret third string so that's down and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.090 
fret third string so that's down and
then<00:01:28.649> take<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.039> third<00:01:29.220> finger<00:01:29.579> off<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
then take the third finger off like that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
then take the third finger off like that
so<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:34.219> that's<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.399> first<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:37.409> let's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so we got that's the first two now let's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.919 
so we got that's the first two now let's
go<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> next<00:01:38.069> step<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:41.509> now<00:01:42.509> we've<00:01:42.780> got

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
go to the next step so now we've got

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.510 
go to the next step so now we've got
down<00:01:43.580> up<00:01:45.200> down<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.829> down

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
down up down up down

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.359 
down up down up down
I<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:49.229> I've<00:01:49.349> got<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.530> right<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.039> got<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I think I've got that right I got to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.589 
I think I've got that right I got to
actually<00:01:50.610> play<00:01:50.789> it<00:01:50.880> fast<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> make<00:01:51.360> sure<00:01:51.509> I'm

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
actually play it fast to make sure I'm

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.480 
actually play it fast to make sure I'm
kidding<00:01:51.929> right

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.030 

okay

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.100 

that's<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.970> whole<00:02:05.120> thing<00:02:05.390> slow<00:02:05.750> I'm<00:02:05.930> going<00:02:05.990> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
that's the whole thing slow I'm going to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.510 
that's the whole thing slow I'm going to
try<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.620> again<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.860> few<00:02:07.070> times<00:02:07.310> and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
try to do it again a few times and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:17.170 
try to do it again a few times and
change<00:02:07.760> up<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.030> speed<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.780> see<00:02:08.990> it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.850 

you'll<00:02:18.180> notice<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.020> stroke<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.650> there

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
you'll notice there's a stroke in there

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.510 
you'll notice there's a stroke in there
that's<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:21.690> off<00:02:22.160> but<00:02:23.160> I'll<00:02:23.250> try<00:02:23.460> it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's a little off but I'll try it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.480 
that's a little off but I'll try it
again<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.910> try<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.360> point<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.690> out

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.700 

I<00:02:31.550> jumped<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.660> body<00:02:33.020> there<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.440> show<00:02:33.650> you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
I jumped in my body there to show you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:42.300 
I jumped in my body there to show you
that<00:02:33.860> particular<00:02:34.430> stroke

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.520 

so<00:02:43.310> those<00:02:43.610> that's<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.450> basic<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.110> what<00:02:45.410> you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
so those that's the basic and what you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.310 
so those that's the basic and what you
want<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.740> do<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.400> speed<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.060> over<00:02:47.660> time<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
want to do is speed that up over time so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.100 
want to do is speed that up over time so
let's<00:02:48.530> try<00:02:48.770> that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.500 

and<00:02:56.800> note<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.490> third<00:02:57.790> finger<00:02:58.030> when<00:02:58.360> it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and note my third finger when it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.000 
and note my third finger when it's
coming<00:02:58.870> down<00:02:59.080> so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
coming down so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
coming down so
[Music]

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:30.280 

so<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.290> looks<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.650> this

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.250 

you<00:03:30.969> need<00:03:31.969> to<00:03:32.060> practice<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.629> over<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.200> over

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
you need to practice that over and over

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.520
