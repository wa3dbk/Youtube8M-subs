00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.269
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.599
 departure with our star craft as in 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.030
 the last video that I uploaded from starcraft and 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.610
 let's make a game and let's play 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.580
 an arcade game that was about 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.179
 face some units against others and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.130
 in the comments a subscriber 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.700
 precisely in singing toad I had 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:35.950
 commented because we were facing 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 100 battle cruisers against 100 lightning bolts 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.610
 of emptiness is worth it then let's do that 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.100
 let's face 100 cruise ships 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.100
 battle against 100 ray of emptiness and 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.260
 this arcade game I have it in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.800
 You can search for favorites in main 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.340
 is called 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.579
 united it's better that it's where we're going to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.400
 face this unit we give you to create 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.560
 departure 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.560
 now we are creating a game 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.770
 and it's a mode that only plays a 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.040
 person to face the units that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 we wish we are going to start the game in 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.650
 the initial mom now we're already 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.610
 if you can talk if you want 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 loans this is this video and base already 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.650
 will be on YouTube 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.680
 Okay so I explain to my 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.470
 subscribers what this is worth this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.830
 game mode here on the left 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 we have all the units of a side 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 let's say it's worth as much as being products 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 as terran and to the right if they saw in 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.070
 minimap, we also have the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.909
 unity of the same lands 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.729
 protos and be but another side is worth 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.290
 also if in another video you want that 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.240
 opposite units you can also me 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 say then if you want me to upload them then 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 either the damage or the shield if they are 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.910
 terrano soldiers those if they are cruisers of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.160
 battle then also the damage or the shield 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.010
 if you want to improve it on this occasion 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.170
 let's face 100 a ray of emptiness 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.620
 against 100 battle cruisers in their 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.930
 mode in its normal state without let's say without 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.160
 develop the ability that is the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.590
 weapons to the first one we go to who in the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.600
 center we have and by on the minimap 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 we have as a battlefield that is 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.709
 where are we going to face the units 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.500
 we are going to select the portal wake and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.500
 let's put the meeting point 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.300
 here on the side are worth 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.990
 let's create the rays of emptiness that 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.690
 they are 100 I will tell and now they will go 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.730
 going out and going to this point of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:13.940
 encounter that we have created 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.940
 let's count 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 11 12 13 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:30.190
 19 20 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 7 and its 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.450
 20 machine we already have 50 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:39.120
 and now let's create another 50 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:57.940
 340 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 950 bone and 50 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 units are going here there is to this 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:08.880
 50 lateral plus 50 are 100 vacuum ray 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.460

 100 battle cruisers that we're going to 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.239
 put the meeting point here in this 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.459
 lateral and we're going to do 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.970
 100 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:28.330

 25 27 28 30 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.800
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 50 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:54.070
 we would have 50 that go here and now 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.070
 another 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:09.470
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 789 you saw that they are 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.669

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.789
 if it is for them to go all over there to 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.900

 we select them all and direct them 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.630
