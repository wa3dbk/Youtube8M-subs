00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 well well 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.460
 it looks like I'm bothered by vermin. 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.220
 it looks like you have bigger problems than that. 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.800
 AAHHH !!! 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.440
 he has an apparent shield to hold us 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.340
 never trust a man with a big mustache 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.200
 or a woman with a big mustache 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 what do you want from our egg head 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.700
 what I want!? 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.080
 nice are you not the one who were looking for my 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.720
 we know you help Lyric 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.960
 just tell where it is and you won't see us anymore 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.200
 or like their eleven 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
 you want to know about Lyric 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.060
 well i know where lyric is 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.700
 never trust a dancing man with a mustache 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 I don't follow it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.200
 it should not be harder to get there 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.780
 but then I can't reach it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 watch you miss the point 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 and that is? 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 NO! 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 an Allen key is required for that job 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.620
 or a fist 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.780
 but Toxic trees are nothing compared to my real master plan 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.280
 tell 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 this thing is a piece of junk 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.340
 hey! 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.920
 * snuff * * snuff * * snuff * and it also smells like a demonic army 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 see the chungel bear finds it dark 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.140
 ooh I forgot to say that I have deactivated your weapon system earlier 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.740
 huh !? 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.080
 I also found a copy of your death egg schematics 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.360
 and uploaded them to spinterest 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.160
 you what !? 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.660
 yes your Wi-Fi is not protected at all 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360
 oh hey three respins 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.900
 no i can't believe it 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.820
 oh yeah, this thing about 20 000 miles late for an oil replacement. 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.540
 never trust auto mechanics 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560
 what did you do with my robot? 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.940
 do I know much what does it look like? 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 blue metal your height 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 oh that yes, I came across it. 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.540
 and where is he now? 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.400
 I threw one part out of the window and the other in the garbage truck 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.520
 (SOUND ALARM) 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.620
 aaaaaaaaah what now 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.540
 Falcon horn 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.920
 uuh look forward to it as if you have a motor problem 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.420
 oil replaced man 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.340
 NO NO NO, NO NO NO !!!!!! 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.460
 Bad luck friend 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 maybe if you let us out. tails can repair your motorcycle. 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.900
 I can actually do that from here 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.680
 SSSSSST !!! 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.020
 I think I have no other choice to release Julie 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.400
 yet 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.780
 please don't punch me in the face 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.960
 I'll do it 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.460
 AAH! 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.600
 mustaches don't count as faces, right? 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.420
 never trust an eckidna with fists
