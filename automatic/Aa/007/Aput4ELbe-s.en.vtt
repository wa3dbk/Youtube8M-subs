okay<00:00:02.780> so<00:00:03.680> I'm<00:00:03.740> still<00:00:03.980> running<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:04.670> sample

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
okay so I'm still running the sample

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.389 
okay so I'm still running the sample
roster<00:00:05.569> in<00:00:05.660> the<00:00:05.779> background<00:00:06.319> so<00:00:06.800> it's<00:00:06.950> noisy

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
roster in the background so it's noisy

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.510 
roster in the background so it's noisy
in<00:00:07.490> here<00:00:07.519> and<00:00:08.330> I<00:00:08.960> was<00:00:09.260> just<00:00:09.320> looking<00:00:09.950> at<00:00:10.310> the

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
in here and I was just looking at the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.580 
in here and I was just looking at the
cuffing<00:00:10.970> result<00:00:11.330> but<00:00:11.570> let<00:00:11.780> these<00:00:11.930> copies<00:00:12.380> cool

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
cuffing result but let these copies cool

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.690 
cuffing result but let these copies cool
down<00:00:14.500> but<00:00:15.500> I'm<00:00:15.650> going<00:00:15.830> to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.600 

I<00:00:18.790> have<00:00:19.450> a<00:00:19.480> good<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.140> bad<00:00:20.320> I<00:00:20.680> know<00:00:21.070> it<00:00:21.310> they<00:00:21.430> are

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
I have a good and bad I know it they are

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.330 
I have a good and bad I know it they are
so<00:00:22.450> it's<00:00:22.600> not<00:00:22.720> exactly<00:00:22.900> blind<00:00:23.500> company<00:00:23.950> these

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
so it's not exactly blind company these

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.810 
so it's not exactly blind company these
three<00:00:24.670> are<00:00:24.850> good<00:00:25.180> these<00:00:25.480> four<00:00:25.870> are<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.950> ones

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
three are good these four are the ones

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.590 
three are good these four are the ones
that<00:00:27.940> have<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.920> luminescent<00:00:29.920> beans<00:00:30.910> under<00:00:31.270> UV

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
that have the luminescent beans under UV

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.920 
that have the luminescent beans under UV
light<00:00:31.630> enough<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:33.300> I've<00:00:34.300> already<00:00:34.450> cooked<00:00:34.780> him

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
light enough and I've already cooked him

00:00:34.930 --> 00:01:03.450 
light enough and I've already cooked him
once<00:00:35.170> so<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.530> kind<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:35.890> have<00:00:36.040> an<00:00:36.160> idea

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.100 

they're<00:01:03.699> not<00:01:03.879> as<00:01:04.059> bad<00:01:04.330> as<00:01:04.510> I<00:01:04.659> thought<00:01:04.690> I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
they're not as bad as I thought I

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.770 
they're not as bad as I thought I
expected<00:01:05.740> something<00:01:06.070> more<00:01:06.250> dramatic

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
expected something more dramatic

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.400 
expected something more dramatic
the<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:09.550> three<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:10.060> are<00:01:10.450> definitely

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
the the three here are definitely

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.240 
the the three here are definitely
brighter<00:01:11.770> leaner<00:01:12.580> like<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.300> more<00:01:13.510> articulate

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
brighter leaner like the more articulate

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.520 
brighter leaner like the more articulate
there's<00:01:15.490> kind<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.970> clean<00:01:16.540> banana<00:01:17.110> fruit

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
there's kind of a clean banana fruit

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.840 
there's kind of a clean banana fruit
flavor<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.940> over<00:01:19.210> here<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.480> thought<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:21.250> was<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
flavor and over here I thought it was a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.730 
flavor and over here I thought it was a
banana<00:01:22.270> flavor<00:01:22.720> but<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.110> was<00:01:23.230> like<00:01:23.380> banana

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
banana flavor but it was like banana

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.810 
banana flavor but it was like banana
skins<00:01:24.480> there's<00:01:25.480> something<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.200> little<00:01:26.820> dirtier

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
skins there's something a little dirtier

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.750 
skins there's something a little dirtier
about<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> finish<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:29.740> not<00:01:29.980> but<00:01:30.310> again<00:01:30.580> it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
about the finish it's not but again it's

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.850 
about the finish it's not but again it's
not<00:01:30.910> as<00:01:31.090> bad<00:01:31.330> as<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.690> thought<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:32.200> thought<00:01:32.500> I'd

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
not as bad as I thought I thought I'd

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.070 
not as bad as I thought I thought I'd
get<00:01:33.070> something<00:01:33.340> over

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
get something over

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.160 
get something over
distinctly<00:01:35.800> bad<00:01:36.240> potentially<00:01:37.240> dirty<00:01:37.900> and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
distinctly bad potentially dirty and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:50.709 
distinctly bad potentially dirty and
moldy

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.510 

it's<00:01:51.049> definitely<00:01:51.499> not<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:51.950> coffee<00:01:52.280> though

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it's definitely not this coffee though

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
it's definitely not this coffee though
and<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> cool<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:54.750> taste

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and is it cool so you can really taste

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.840 
and is it cool so you can really taste
it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.350 
it
my<00:01:56.390> idea<00:01:57.050> too<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.159> will<00:01:58.490> fade<00:01:59.000> over

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
my idea too is that this will fade over

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.530 
my idea too is that this will fade over
time<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.320> will<00:02:00.380> become<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.860> worse<00:02:01.100> Cup<00:02:01.540> in

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
time this will become a worse Cup in

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.720 
time this will become a worse Cup in
three<00:02:02.900> months<00:02:03.290> during<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> green<00:02:04.100> coffee

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.180 

that<00:02:08.330> fermentation<00:02:10.090> bacteria<00:02:11.950> those<00:02:12.950> could

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
that fermentation bacteria those could

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.800 
that fermentation bacteria those could
both<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:14.420> possible<00:02:14.990> here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
both be possible here

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.450 
both be possible here
like<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.960> said<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.320> terms<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.740> roasting<00:02:19.250> they

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
like I said in terms of roasting they

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.770 
like I said in terms of roasting they
were<00:02:19.520> even

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
were even

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.400 
were even
even<00:02:22.780> lady<00:02:23.040> uneven<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:25.630> doesn't<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.290> do

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
even lady uneven it doesn't have to do

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.500 
even lady uneven it doesn't have to do
with<00:02:26.440> ripeness<00:02:26.770> that's<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.210> banana

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
with ripeness that's one of the banana

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.699 
with ripeness that's one of the banana
peel<00:02:28.810> flavors<00:02:29.260> are<00:02:29.410> sometimes<00:02:29.740> rightness

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
peel flavors are sometimes rightness

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.039 
peel flavors are sometimes rightness
our<00:02:32.709> underwrite<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:34.239> that's<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.750> no<00:02:34.900> that's

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
our underwrite but that's like no that's

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.559 
our underwrite but that's like no that's

not what we're seeing

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.649 
not what we're seeing
I<00:02:38.109> expected<00:02:39.040> fermentation<00:02:39.459> flavors<00:02:40.299> over

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
I expected fermentation flavors over

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.520 
I expected fermentation flavors over
here<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.049> didn't<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.439> so<00:02:42.249> I<00:02:43.349> can<00:02:44.349> tell

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
here that I didn't get so I can tell

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.890 
here that I didn't get so I can tell
there's<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.799> quality<00:02:45.400> problem<00:02:45.609> I<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.659> know

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
there's a quality problem I don't know

there's a quality problem I don't know
