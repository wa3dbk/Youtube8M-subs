so<00:01:08.880> we'll<00:01:09.840> start<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.470> jolt<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> jolt

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
so we'll start with you jolt the jolt

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.810 
so we'll start with you jolt the jolt
just<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:13.910> simple<00:01:14.480> little<00:01:15.020> gun<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.580> sound

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
just a simple little gun and the sound

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.270 
just a simple little gun and the sound
is<00:01:17.000> really<00:01:17.120> realistic<00:01:17.920> there's<00:01:18.920> something

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
is really realistic there's something

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.760 
is really realistic there's something
very<00:01:19.430> strange<00:01:19.580> about<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.090> jolt<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:26.530> think<00:01:27.530> we

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
very strange about the jolt I think we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.040 
very strange about the jolt I think we
get<00:01:27.920> faster<00:01:28.430> then<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.420> see<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:29.630> dick<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:32.050> get

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
get faster then I can see you dick I get

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.590 
get faster then I can see you dick I get
a<00:01:33.080> better<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.800> fire<00:01:34.040> out<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:34.700> than<00:01:35.480> I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
a better and a fire out of this than I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.620 
a better and a fire out of this than I
do<00:01:35.660> out<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.320> Stampede<00:01:37.360> that's<00:01:38.360> pretty

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
do out of the Stampede that's pretty

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.260 
do out of the Stampede that's pretty
strange<00:01:38.900> but<00:01:39.380> that's<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.610> only<00:01:40.820> one<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.000> it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
strange but that's the only one that it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.560 
strange but that's the only one that it
does<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.870> with<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:43.730> doesn't<00:01:43.940> make<00:01:44.210> sense<00:01:44.450> I

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
does that with it doesn't make sense I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.730 
does that with it doesn't make sense I
mean<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.810> makes<00:01:44.930> sense<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.260> I<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:45.620> that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
mean it makes sense that I can do that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.440 
mean it makes sense that I can do that
with<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> rail<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:48.910> mean<00:01:49.910> that's<00:01:50.090> not<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.330> way

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
with the rail I mean that's not the way

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:59.550 
with the rail I mean that's not the way
it<00:01:50.600> works<00:01:51.400> but<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.670> doesn't<00:01:52.820> make<00:01:53.030> sense<00:01:53.300> for

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.160 

and<00:02:01.360> maverick<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.720> sounds<00:02:06.020> are<00:02:06.140> really

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
and maverick the sounds are really

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.040 
and maverick the sounds are really
realistic<00:02:06.790> like<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.510> Maverick

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
realistic like that was the Maverick

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.960 
realistic like that was the Maverick
in-game<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.770> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> real<00:02:10.310> maverick<00:02:15.970> so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
in-game and this is a real maverick so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.170 
in-game and this is a real maverick so
the<00:02:17.090> sounds<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.989> make<00:02:18.560> sense<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:19.180> think

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the sounds really make sense I think

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.509 
the sounds really make sense I think
they<00:02:20.330> were<00:02:20.390> actually<00:02:20.570> recorded<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:22.250> turning

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
they were actually recorded it's turning

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:31.030 
they were actually recorded it's turning
nothing<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.510> Recon<00:02:29.830> nothing<00:02:30.830> really

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
nothing so now the Recon nothing really

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.530 
nothing so now the Recon nothing really
special<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:34.430> still<00:02:34.940> pretty<00:02:35.060> cool

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
special but it's still pretty cool

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.300 
special but it's still pretty cool
it'll<00:02:36.080> be<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.350> cool<00:02:36.680> if<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:36.950> could<00:02:37.100> like

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
it'll be really cool if you could like

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.440 
it'll be really cool if you could like
to<00:02:37.430> take<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:37.820> stock<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> barrel<00:02:39.440> off<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
to take this stock in the barrel off and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.670 
to take this stock in the barrel off and
have<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.989> change<00:02:42.380> Jack<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.890> seems<00:02:43.190> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
have it that change Jack here seems that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.309 
have it that change Jack here seems that
that<00:02:45.680> would<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:45.920> nice

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.430 

now<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.130> longshot<00:02:51.140> really<00:02:52.140> long<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:55.319> these

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
now the longshot really long and these

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.990 
now the longshot really long and these
things<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.580> little<00:02:56.849> bit<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
things do actually have a little bit of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.559 
things do actually have a little bit of
blue<00:02:57.209> clouds<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.000> doesn't<00:03:00.270> really<00:03:00.390> make

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
blue clouds and that doesn't really make

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:09.620 
blue clouds and that doesn't really make
sense<00:03:00.599> then<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.380> Raider<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:09.420> them

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
sense then the Raider and if I are them

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.290 
sense then the Raider and if I are them
normally<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:11.040> right-click<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.420> fire<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:14.300> and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
normally you right-click and fire it and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.780 
normally you right-click and fire it and
then<00:03:15.510> right-click<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> ring<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> fire<00:03:16.890> then

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
then right-click the ring the fire then

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.820 
then right-click the ring the fire then
you<00:03:17.970> hold<00:03:18.150> back<00:03:18.330> up<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.750> shoots<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> then<00:03:19.620> it

shot<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.290> six<00:05:05.560> start<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.550> then<00:05:07.150> it's<00:05:07.510> it

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
shot the six start and then it's it

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.700

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
and then the durability disappears off

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.800 
and then the durability disappears off
this<00:05:18.729> off<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.360> clip<00:05:20.789> but<00:05:21.789> I<00:05:21.820> think<00:05:22.180> if<00:05:22.390> I<00:05:22.840> am<00:05:22.990> in

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
this off the clip but I think if I am in

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.100 
this off the clip but I think if I am in
survival<00:05:25.810> mode<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.680> will<00:05:26.979> actually<00:05:27.520> break

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.560 

it<00:05:34.110> actually<00:05:34.290> use<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:34.910> remote<00:05:35.910> cliffs<00:05:39.500> so

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
it actually use this remote cliffs so

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.830 
it actually use this remote cliffs so
apparently<00:05:43.040> I'm<00:05:44.040> not<00:05:44.280> really<00:05:44.430> sure<00:05:44.760> how<00:05:44.970> that

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
apparently I'm not really sure how that

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.000 
apparently I'm not really sure how that
works<00:05:46.110> but<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:47.670> has<00:05:47.700> an<00:05:48.270> 18<00:05:48.990> dot<00:05:49.320> drunk<00:05:49.680> clip

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
works but it has an 18 dot drunk clip

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.010 
works but it has an 18 dot drunk clip
and<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.640> 35<00:05:51.120> don't<00:05:51.390> drown

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
and the 35 don't drown

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.280 
and the 35 don't drown
these<00:05:52.860> two<00:05:53.100> are<00:05:53.250> just<00:05:53.280> used<00:05:53.640> in<00:05:53.790> crafting<00:05:54.290> and

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
these two are just used in crafting and

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.770 
these two are just used in crafting and
if<00:05:55.890> you<00:05:56.010> have<00:05:56.220> no<00:05:56.460> ammo<00:05:56.790> it<00:05:57.090> of<00:05:57.360> course<00:05:57.510> won't

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
if you have no ammo it of course won't

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.710 
if you have no ammo it of course won't
shoot<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:59.820> I<00:05:59.940> think<00:06:00.180> now<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.330> I'm<00:06:00.540> in

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470
