like about this board there are a lot of
attachment<00:00:30.910> points<00:00:31.239> so<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:32.619> we<00:00:32.739> can<00:00:32.860> do<00:00:33.040> is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
attachment points so what we can do is

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.850 
attachment points so what we can do is
if<00:00:33.370> we<00:00:33.489> want<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.760> run<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.570> bungee<00:00:35.470> let's<00:00:35.649> see<00:00:35.769> on

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
front so he paddles out anchors this

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.600 
front so he paddles out anchors this
thing<00:01:02.350> puts<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.829> short<00:01:03.040> board<00:01:03.189> on<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.400> front

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
thing puts a short board on the front

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.870 
thing puts a short board on the front
but<00:01:03.759> if<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:03.909> can<00:01:04.059> tell<00:01:04.299> this<00:01:05.049> thing<00:01:05.290> has<00:01:05.470> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
but if you can tell this thing has a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.390 
but if you can tell this thing has a
really<00:01:06.880> really<00:01:07.180> low<00:01:07.799> rocker<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.159> cruises

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
really really low rocker so it cruises

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.219 
really really low rocker so it cruises
in<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.729> flats<00:01:12.970> pretty<00:01:13.360> nicely<00:01:13.570> can<00:01:13.900> actually

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
in the flats pretty nicely can actually

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.490 
in the flats pretty nicely can actually
surfs<00:01:14.520> pretty<00:01:15.520> okay<00:01:16.360> in<00:01:16.479> smaller<00:01:17.049> waves<00:01:17.290> I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
surfs pretty okay in smaller waves I

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200 
surfs pretty okay in smaller waves I
haven't<00:01:17.710> tried<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.979> anything<00:01:18.189> bigger<00:01:18.520> but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
haven't tried in anything bigger but

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
there's a lot of attachment points on

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.880 
there's a lot of attachment points on
this<00:01:20.770> board<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.340> make<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.700> really<00:01:21.729> really

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this board that make it really really

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.910 
this board that make it really really
convenient<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:26.110> great<00:01:26.350> great<00:01:26.680> all-around

629 half four and a half and I don't
know<00:01:48.280> if<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.400> can<00:01:48.520> see<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.880> right<00:01:49.060> here<00:01:49.119> but

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
know if you can see it right here but

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.520 
know if you can see it right here but
there's<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.750> kind<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.830> kind<00:01:51.420> beveled<00:01:52.420> edge<00:01:53.140> on

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
there's a kind of a kind beveled edge on

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.750 
there's a kind of a kind beveled edge on
the<00:01:53.650> rail<00:01:53.890> rails<00:01:54.250> are<00:01:54.400> really<00:01:54.580> soft<00:01:56.760> maybe

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
the rail rails are really soft maybe

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.359 
the rail rails are really soft maybe
just<00:01:57.940> kind<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.360> beaded<00:01:59.170> edge<00:01:59.320> but<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.860> rails

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
just kind of a beaded edge but the rails

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.469 
just kind of a beaded edge but the rails
are<00:02:00.520> pretty<00:02:00.700> soft<00:02:00.909> throughout<00:02:01.180> this<00:02:01.270> whole

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
are pretty soft throughout this whole

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
are pretty soft throughout this whole
thing<00:02:01.659> especially<00:02:02.350> as<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.710> goes<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.010> front

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
thing especially as it goes to the front

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.920 
thing especially as it goes to the front
it<00:02:04.450> gets<00:02:04.689> even<00:02:04.869> more<00:02:05.020> soft<00:02:05.470> another<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:07.060> think

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
it gets even more soft another I think

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.990 
it gets even more soft another I think
about<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.229> board<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.799> have<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.789> hard<00:02:09.970> time

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
about this board if you have a hard time

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
about this board if you have a hard time
carrying<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:13.110> leach<00:02:14.110> plug<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.470> front

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
carrying it is leach plug in the front

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.729 
carrying it is leach plug in the front
to<00:02:14.830> attach<00:02:15.069> another<00:02:15.220> carrying<00:02:15.760> spot<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.260> of

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
to attach another carrying spot and of

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.679 
to attach another carrying spot and of
course<00:02:17.980> you've<00:02:18.159> got<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.849> handle<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
course you've got the handle in the

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.589 
course you've got the handle in the
middle<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.680> want<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.099> can<00:02:21.250> attach

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
middle if you really want you can attach

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.090 
middle if you really want you can attach
handles<00:02:22.599> onto<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
handles onto the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.780 
handles onto the
screw<00:02:26.100> inserts<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> side<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:29.490> around
