00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
we have some of the targets that we were

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130 
we have some of the targets that we were
set<00:02:02.189> them<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> last<00:02:03.210> four<00:02:03.540> games<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.049> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
set them for the last four games and as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.749 
set them for the last four games and as
you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.890> achieved<00:02:05.189> three<00:02:05.520> out

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you can see there we achieved three out

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
you can see there we achieved three out
of<00:02:05.790> four<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> them<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.540> only<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.899> missing<00:02:07.320> out

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
of four of them but only one missing out

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.830 
of four of them but only one missing out
on<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> goals<00:02:08.729> two<00:02:08.940> shot<00:02:09.209> conversion

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
on and was the goals two shot conversion

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
on and was the goals two shot conversion
rate<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.500> we've<00:02:10.619> been<00:02:10.770> setting<00:02:10.979> new<00:02:11.099> targets

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
rate but we've been setting new targets

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
rate but we've been setting new targets
here<00:02:11.670> average<00:02:11.910> rating<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.349> 6.9<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> think<00:02:13.680> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
here average rating of 6.9 I think that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.670 
here average rating of 6.9 I think that
says<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.239> one<00:02:15.239> goal<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> 13%<00:02:16.530> goal

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
says and one goal and the 13% goal

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.290 
says and one goal and the 13% goal
two-shot<00:02:17.010> conversion<00:02:17.489> rate<00:02:17.730> which<00:02:18.150> i<00:02:18.239> think

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
two-shot conversion rate which i think

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.760 
two-shot conversion rate which i think
is<00:02:18.510> perfectly<00:02:18.930> doable<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.379> we're<00:02:19.500> gonna<00:02:19.590> try

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
is perfectly doable so we're gonna try

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.050 
is perfectly doable so we're gonna try
and<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:20.010> those<00:02:20.160> done<00:02:20.340> over<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> course<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and get those done over the course of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
and get those done over the course of
the<00:02:21.180> next<00:02:21.330> four<00:02:21.599> games<00:02:21.660> look<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.650> leaked

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the next four games look for leaked

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.460 
the next four games look for leaked
games<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> our<00:02:24.540> next<00:02:24.810> game<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> an

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
games that is and our next game is a an

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.170 
games that is and our next game is a an
away<00:02:25.830> fixture<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.430> Wolverhampton<00:02:27.030> Wanderers

away fixture to Wolverhampton Wanderers

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.990 
away fixture to Wolverhampton Wanderers
and<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.800> game<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.069> very<00:02:29.489> few<00:02:29.730> chances

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and this is a game of very few chances

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
and this is a game of very few chances
and<00:02:30.390> early<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.440> features<00:02:31.950> were<00:02:32.069> given<00:02:32.280> away

and early on features were given away

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.759 
and early on features were given away
position<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.120> defensive<00:02:33.840> error<00:02:34.080> allows

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
position but a defensive error allows

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.759 
position but a defensive error allows
him<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> capitalize<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.989> give<00:02:37.560> us<00:02:37.650> an

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
him to capitalize and just give us an

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.860 
him to capitalize and just give us an
early<00:02:37.920> lead<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.300> fortunate<00:02:39.540> for

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
early lead which is really fortunate for

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.770 
early lead which is really fortunate for
us<00:02:39.959> seeing<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.440> game<00:02:40.620> was<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.519> like<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.660> was

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
us seeing as the game was so like it was

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.630 
us seeing as the game was so like it was
such<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.019> close<00:02:43.290> game<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.830> was<00:02:43.950> no<00:02:44.280> real

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
such a close game like there was no real

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.009 
such a close game like there was no real
space<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.330> was<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> no<00:02:45.690> clear-cut

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
space there was a no clear-cut

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.780 
space there was a no clear-cut
opportunities<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.129> it's<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.459> good<00:02:47.640> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
opportunities so it's really good that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.729 
opportunities so it's really good that
we<00:02:47.849> took<00:02:48.000> those<00:02:48.180> chances<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.989> wolves<00:02:49.590> had<00:02:49.709> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
we took those chances and wolves had a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.229 
we took those chances and wolves had a
chance<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.160> their<00:02:50.310> own<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.819> few<00:02:51.000> minutes

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239

redeem<00:03:01.680> himself<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.580> restore<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
redeem himself and just to restore the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.380 
redeem himself and just to restore the
team's<00:03:03.540> confidence<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:04.200> him<00:03:04.349> but<00:03:04.920> um<00:03:05.390> yeah

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
team's confidence in him but um yeah

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.910 
team's confidence in him but um yeah
like<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:06.750> said<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.080> game<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.500> game<00:03:07.590> of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
like I said the game was the game of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.770 
like I said the game was the game of
very<00:03:08.159> few<00:03:08.400> chances<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.569> one

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
very few chances I think that this one

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.899 
very few chances I think that this one
and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.050> one<00:03:10.260> more<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> second<00:03:10.950> half

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
and then one more in the second half

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.280 
and then one more in the second half
this<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.810> goes<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.319> wide<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
this one just goes just wide of the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.110 
this one just goes just wide of the
goalkeepers<00:03:16.290> near<00:03:17.069> post<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.430> guess<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.849> far

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
goalkeepers near post I guess or far

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.050 
goalkeepers near post I guess or far
post<00:03:19.099> yeah<00:03:20.099> this<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> only<00:03:20.610> other<00:03:20.790> chance

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060

the goalkeeper Perris it and wild can

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.020 
the goalkeeper Perris it and wild can

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
chance and double to leave and relieve

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
chance and double to leave and relieve
the<00:03:28.830> pressure<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.940> side<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.390> he's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
the pressure on the side but he's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.780 
the pressure on the side but he's
unfortunate<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.470> convert<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.040> um

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
unfortunate and not to convert and um

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.789 
unfortunate and not to convert and um
yeah<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.319> good<00:03:34.500> first<00:03:34.709> half

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
yeah it was a really good first half

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.289 
yeah it was a really good first half
from<00:03:35.010> us<00:03:35.159> but<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> second<00:03:35.670> half<00:03:35.790> was<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.000> very

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
from us but the second half was a very

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.750 
from us but the second half was a very
weak<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:37.049> lot<00:03:37.349> more<00:03:37.530> balanced<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.069> only<00:03:38.610> an

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
weak and a lot more balanced so only an

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.910 
weak and a lot more balanced so only an
average<00:03:38.849> reign<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.239> 6.6<00:03:39.959> which<00:03:40.140> isn't<00:03:40.379> too<00:03:40.680> bad

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
average reign of 6.6 which isn't too bad

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.130 
average reign of 6.6 which isn't too bad
but<00:03:41.190> that's<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.519> what<00:03:41.640> we<00:03:41.760> want<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> begin<00:03:42.299> I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
but that's not what we want to begin I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.520 
but that's not what we want to begin I
think<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:45.120> start<00:03:45.390> off<00:03:45.569> again<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.319> next

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
think we start off again in the next

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440 
think we start off again in the next
