hard<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.349> go

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
hard about it but I just want to go

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200 
hard about it but I just want to go
through<00:00:19.710> step<00:00:19.890> by<00:00:19.949> step<00:00:20.099> so<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

look for so with that I guess let's move
on<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> doing<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.619> point<00:00:25.949> we're

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
on to doing that's at this point we're

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
on to doing that's at this point we're
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> work<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.580> getting<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.000> cluster<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
going to work on getting this cluster of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.249 
going to work on getting this cluster of
the<00:00:28.080> bezel<00:00:28.439> off<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> radio<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> sembly<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
now where we can get to radio go ahead

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.080 
now where we can get to radio go ahead
and<00:00:33.300> remove<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:35.040> particular<00:00:35.250> custom<00:00:36.000> is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the main two connectors and then we got

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.400 
the main two connectors and then we got
our<00:02:02.860> antenna<00:02:03.860> connect<00:02:04.750> now<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> radio<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.290> out
