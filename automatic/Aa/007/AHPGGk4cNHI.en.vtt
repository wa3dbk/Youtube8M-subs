 do not 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.399
 they are missing the truth 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:14.049
 no way 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.989

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 Jerusalem 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 the malaga racing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.950
 there is still a lot and when it does 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.960
 they are not just 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.979
 the psoe does 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.019
 friends are made work link and or medicine 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 work has no work or doctors 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.010
 by the way I people 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.060
 I have not achieved through a student of mine 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.730
 I was a doctor 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.020
 nil 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.240
 intruders some I've had after classes 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.300
 dawn in adoptions to couples in that do not hear have been married 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.190
 already chose five 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.420
 bogado of students who have been married in the class because 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.110
 they are many years and a lot of the days 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.649
 to the character 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.289
 they saw once a week to start believing in two 3 4 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.260
 if you want to do despite the character people 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.520
 yesterday to the republic 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.290
 a way to avoid exercising 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.380
 the expected by the people 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.430
 the Cuba issue does not derive from the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.070
 the investigator 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.980
 the organism ensures 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.270
 the Spanish 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.570
 good for nobody 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.060
 the real building 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 for morgan 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.870
 U.S 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.890
 you can carry out 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 now we must lay the foundations of al qaeda 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.460
 and also as he adds 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.890
 the artist had given 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.700
 but I would love to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 the one that seems 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.390
 r 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.330
 so much to relate to him but recognizes that he has not collaborated as he was 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 to be expected not now 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.550
 persists 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.379
 and as a healthy alternative 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.929
 to the night exit 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.489
 but 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 that's why we've asked him 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.639
 yesterday the agent to start 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.799
 there may be something was / pl 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 that year the defendant 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.289
 the environment that there are enough years 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.780
 and that we have to carry them out by stages every day 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.259
 the previous exercise 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.190
 the fake 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.820
 mixes with the riva the base and we integrate 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 all Latinos of all Spaniards 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.769
 we mix 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.399
 we are there were ap at the time of 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.719
 that go next to her 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.069
 give it when to move 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.380
 like all of us from Alava, we make the wheel 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.509
 what we wanted 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.919
 animation 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.729
 the blunder as we say the horn sold in Spain is nothing 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.699
 it's a very nice mix we laugh we enjoy 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.979
 we play learn 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.249
 we know each other 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.099
 they know our cultures 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.939
 our culture our country 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.959
 we are knowing 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.639
 the type ones that we are the ones that arrived 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.729
 but at the same time 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.469
 when we started talking 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.370
 they know ours even 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.150
 they go to our countries because he can not say that curiosity about 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.499
 know the most 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.819
 power for power 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.209
 to see how it was 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.929
 it laughs at us without 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.929
 they not only want you to treat a topic but also sherry 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 teatres 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.270
