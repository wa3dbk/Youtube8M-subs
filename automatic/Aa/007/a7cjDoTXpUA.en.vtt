00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
know man but he had what I think 12

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.460 
know man but he had what I think 12
counts<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.730> 17<00:02:26.060> counts<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.390> some<00:02:26.510> time<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
counts of 17 counts for some time so I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.870 
counts of 17 counts for some time so I
mean<00:02:27.709> he<00:02:27.800> has<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> lot<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.489> all<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.790> it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
mean he has a lot of but all of it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.970 
mean he has a lot of but all of it
really<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.269> they<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.110> stack<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.500> count<00:02:30.739> all

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
really is they just stack the count all

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.040 
really is they just stack the count all
of<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:31.760> saying<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.599> didn't<00:02:32.900> think

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
of it is really saying I didn't think

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.710 
of it is really saying I didn't think
about<00:02:33.349> this<00:02:33.560> 13<00:02:34.130> 13<00:02:34.730> 13<00:02:34.760> 13<00:02:35.330> 13<00:02:37.209> years<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.599> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
about this 13 13 13 13 13 years to the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.650 
about this 13 13 13 13 13 years to the
day<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.099> verdict<00:02:40.519> came<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.760> third<00:02:41.480> I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
day that the verdict came in third I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.690 
day that the verdict came in third I
mean<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.290> very<00:02:42.620> very<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.950> reckon<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.489> think

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
mean that is very very I reckon I think

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.820 
mean that is very very I reckon I think
that's<00:02:44.000> why<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.180> jury<00:02:44.450> wouldn't<00:02:44.750> go<00:02:44.959> home<00:02:45.200> 14

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
that's why the jury wouldn't go home 14

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.970 
that's why the jury wouldn't go home 14
hours<00:02:46.310> no<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:47.090> think<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:47.540> were<00:02:47.660> trying

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
hours no I think that they were trying

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.780 
hours no I think that they were trying
perhaps<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.100> was<00:02:49.250> trying<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.459> make<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.640> statement

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
perhaps I was trying to make a statement

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.850
