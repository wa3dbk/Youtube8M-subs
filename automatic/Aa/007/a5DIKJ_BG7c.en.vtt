up I'm keeping my right foot stationary

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
up I'm keeping my right foot stationary
so<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> same<00:01:22.860> position

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so I can go back into the same position

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
so I can go back into the same position
and<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.630> again<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.230> to<00:01:25.290> start

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
and I'm like again I'm going to start
with<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> figure<00:01:26.160> eight<00:01:26.310> pattern<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.870> you<00:01:27.990> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
with a figure eight pattern and you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.700 
with a figure eight pattern and you can
see<00:01:28.260> how<00:01:28.350> nice<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.680> flew<00:01:29.190> with<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.730> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
see how nice and flew with that is and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
see how nice and flew with that is and
hopefully<00:01:31.710> i'm<00:01:32.220> getting<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.670> hand<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
hopefully i'm getting my hand in the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
hopefully i'm getting my hand in the
picture<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:35.010> could<00:01:35.190> see<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
picture here that you could see and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
picture here that you could see and
translate<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:37.560> other<00:01:37.680> thing<00:01:37.800> i'd<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
translate one other thing i'd like to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.540 
translate one other thing i'd like to
bring<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.510> visual<00:01:39.780> input<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.550> you'll

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
bring up with the visual input is you'll

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.440 
bring up with the visual input is you'll
notice<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.750> slight<00:01:43.110> delay

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
notice that there is a slight delay

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.960 
notice that there is a slight delay
individual<00:01:45.450> input<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.430> that's<00:01:47.430> strictly<00:01:47.700> due

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
individual input and that's strictly due

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.880 
individual input and that's strictly due
to<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.240> camera<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> processing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to the camera and not the processing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090 
to the camera and not the processing
power<00:01:50.100> itself<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> let's<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
power itself so let's go back to the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.840 
power itself so let's go back to the
display<00:01:54.260> clear<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.380> display<00:01:55.830> go<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> the

display clear to display go back to the
figure<00:01:57.180> eight<00:01:57.360> pattern<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> i'm<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
figure eight pattern and i'm going to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
figure eight pattern and i'm going to
move<00:01:59.880> slightly<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.660> i'm<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.050> go<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.410> well

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
move slightly up i'm going to go up well

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.200 
move slightly up i'm going to go up well
as<00:02:01.920> I'm<00:02:02.100> making<00:02:02.370> this<00:02:02.460> pattern<00:02:02.880> i'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.150> to

as I'm making this pattern i'm going to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.350 
as I'm making this pattern i'm going to
stand<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.570> stay<00:02:03.840> stationary<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.850> draw<00:02:05.850> over

demonstration video just so you can you
can<00:02:50.550> translate<00:02:51.030> what's<00:02:51.450> happening<00:02:52.340> from<00:02:53.340> my

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
can translate what's happening from my

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.470 
can translate what's happening from my
hand<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.540> screen<00:02:55.140> input<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.450> move

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
hand to the screen input then I can move

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.670 
hand to the screen input then I can move
forward<00:02:59.360> okay<00:03:00.360> i'm<00:03:00.690> keeping<00:03:01.110> my<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.440> foot

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
stationary so you'll have to just kind

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.040 
stationary so you'll have to just kind
of<00:03:04.410> interpret<00:03:04.770> where<00:03:05.220> I'm<00:03:05.430> standing<00:03:06.020> but<00:03:07.020> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
of interpret where I'm standing but I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.660 
of interpret where I'm standing but I
can<00:03:07.320> move<00:03:07.440> all<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.830> way<00:03:07.860> back<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.430> you're<00:03:08.580> not

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
can move all the way back but you're not

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.210 
can move all the way back but you're not
going<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.240> hand<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.110> could<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.100> that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
going to see my hand so we could do that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.510 
going to see my hand so we could do that
for<00:03:11.280> another<00:03:11.640> one<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.110> chose<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.100> could

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
for another one if I so chose to I could

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.270 
for another one if I so chose to I could
actually<00:03:14.700> draw<00:03:15.210> with<00:03:15.420> my<00:03:15.600> head<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.130> could<00:03:17.130> draw

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
actually draw with my head I could draw

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.820 
actually draw with my head I could draw
with<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.580> left<00:03:17.610> hand<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.390> could<00:03:19.320> draw<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.680> my

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
with my left hand I could draw with my

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.810 
with my left hand I could draw with my
foot<00:03:21.080> due<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.410> limited<00:03:22.530> amount<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.550> time
