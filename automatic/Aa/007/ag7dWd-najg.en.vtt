00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.219
 one year after the launch of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 two-wheel drive version from fiat 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.619
 puts freemont on the market with the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.619
 four-wheel drive 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 the freemont all wheel drive relies on 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 a completely versatile system 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.230
 automatic able to adapt to each 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 type of fund works so in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 optimal conditions 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.150
 the driving force is addressed to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.940
 front end as soon as the front wheels 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.129
 lose grip the driving force comes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 transferred to the rear ones so 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.320
 automatic and in proportion to the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 speed difference between the two axes 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 nothing changes inside 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 seven seats so much space with the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.230
 possibility to choose up to 32 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.910
 different configurations of the passenger compartment 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 at normal speeds it is hard to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 find differences in behavior with 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 the front-wheel drive version only 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 despite the size we are talking about 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.289
 a 7-seater car with a high center of gravity 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 which exceeds two tons 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.590
 the fiat freemont all wheel drive if not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.590
 hurts badly in the curve 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.750
 and is quite precise on the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.460
 straight and then gradually increases 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 speed to intelligent distribution 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.939
 of the pair between two rods allows 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.810
 face the curves with major 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.460
 balance the freemont 4x4 has limits of 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.500
 road holding higher than the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.200
 two-wheel drive version and minor 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.229
 understeer from this legacy to the engine 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.329
 2 liter multijet turbo diesel from 170 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.490
 horses paired exclusively with 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.530
 six-speed automatic transmission a little 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.600
 slow and afflicted by an excessive effect 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.399
 drive converter everything 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.929
 this causes the price of the first 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.369
 of its consumption especially in the city 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.140
 they rise considerably 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.179
 ultimately to the advantages of the version 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250
 four-wheel drive are appreciated 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.640
 especially on soils with low adhesion 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.439
 on the snow of course and on the dirt roads 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 the fiat freemont all wheel drive is 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.340
 instead less convincing on the passages more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.860
 insidious of our track of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.989
 off-road vehicle of mairano without the reduced ones 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.269
 with little grip it is difficult to overcome 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.459
 more challenging and downhill climbs not 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.910
 can not even rely on the control of 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.910
 speed
