00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay on this section I'm this step 9 of

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.710 
okay on this section I'm this step 9 of
the<00:00:03.000> breaststroke

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
the breaststroke

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.760 
the breaststroke
I'm<00:00:03.929> gonna<00:00:04.080> end<00:00:04.319> up<00:00:04.410> explaining<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.420> how<00:00:06.420> to

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
I'm gonna end up explaining to how to

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
I'm gonna end up explaining to how to
write<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.010> were<00:00:08.220> back<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.550> prayer

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
write so you were back on prayer

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.190 
write so you were back on prayer
position<00:00:09.210> right<00:00:09.360> from<00:00:09.540> step<00:00:09.780> 8

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
position right from step 8

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
position right from step 8
your<00:00:10.710> legs<00:00:10.889> are<00:00:11.040> up<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.580> you're<00:00:11.730> getting

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
your legs are up to but you're getting

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
your legs are up to but you're getting
prepared<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> kick<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.590> section<00:00:13.860> if

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
prepared to kick now in this section if

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
prepared to kick now in this section if
you<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.610> kind<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.880> take<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> full<00:00:15.599> body<00:00:15.949> angle

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you can kind of take a full body angle

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
you can kind of take a full body angle
all<00:00:17.340> right<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.940> you're<00:00:18.090> right<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.510> step<00:00:18.750> 8

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
all right so you're right here on step 8

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.200 
all right so you're right here on step 8
when<00:00:19.740> you're<00:00:19.859> getting<00:00:20.130> prepared<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> kick<00:00:20.910> as

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
when you're getting prepared to kick as

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.810 
when you're getting prepared to kick as
you<00:00:22.080> are<00:00:22.439> doing<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> half<00:00:23.070> circle<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you are doing the half circle and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000 
you are doing the half circle and
kicking<00:00:24.539> you're<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> end<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.710> slicing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
kicking you're going to end up slicing

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
kicking you're going to end up slicing
through<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> water<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> step<00:00:27.150> 9

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
through the water on step 9

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630 
through the water on step 9
so<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.170> repeating<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> you're

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
so you're repeating and you're

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
so you're repeating and you're
continuing<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> breaststroke<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
continuing with the breaststroke and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.389 
continuing with the breaststroke and
you're<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> put<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.099> head<00:00:32.189> back<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you're going to put your head back in

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
you're going to put your head back in
the<00:00:32.579> water<00:00:32.790> after<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> took<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> breath<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the water after you took a breath so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
the water after you took a breath so
after<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> explained<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> reason<00:00:35.760> why

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
after I explained that the reason why

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
after I explained that the reason why
you<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.520> when<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you want to do that is because when you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
you want to do that is because when you
came<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.570> step<00:00:39.870> 7<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.590> half<00:00:40.770> circle<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
came up from step 7 the half circle and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
came up from step 7 the half circle and
then<00:00:42.300> you're<00:00:42.480> slicing<00:00:42.750> into<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> water<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
then you're slicing into the water you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
then you're slicing into the water you
want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:44.879> head<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> what

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
want to have your head in so that what

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.029 
want to have your head in so that what
your<00:00:45.899> body<00:00:46.079> looks<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:46.920> you're

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
your body looks like this when you're

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
your body looks like this when you're
gliding<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.840> very

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
gliding and so you're just very

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
gliding and so you're just very
aerodynamic<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
aerodynamic and you can just go that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
aerodynamic and you can just go that
much<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.270> quicker<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.930> less<00:00:52.140> effort

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
much more quicker and it's less effort

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
much more quicker and it's less effort
on<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.649> part<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> main<00:00:53.760> reason<00:00:53.910> why

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on your part that's the main reason why

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
on your part that's the main reason why
you<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.379> again<00:00:55.500> step<00:00:56.160> 7<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.699> like

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you do that so again step 7 was like

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
you do that so again step 7 was like
this<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.570> come<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> half<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.530> legs<00:00:58.859> come<00:00:59.100> up

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this you come up half your legs come up

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.700 
this you come up half your legs come up
and<00:00:59.520> as<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.359> legs<00:01:00.539> begin<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> kick<00:01:01.170> you're

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and as your legs begin to kick you're

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770 
and as your legs begin to kick you're
gonna<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.340> prayer<00:01:02.579> position<00:01:02.760> from<00:01:03.329> step<00:01:03.600> 8

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
gonna be in prayer position from step 8

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.740 
gonna be in prayer position from step 8
and<00:01:03.989> slice<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.460> step<00:01:05.670> 9<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.600> head

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and slice in with step 9 with your head

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
and slice in with step 9 with your head
in<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.490> full<00:01:08.760> complete

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in and that is your full complete

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
in and that is your full complete
breaststroke<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.850> where<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> would

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
breaststroke and that's where you would

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.410 
breaststroke and that's where you would
do<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.510> step<00:01:12.689> 9<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> breaststroke<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> you'll

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
do for step 9 of breaststroke so you'll

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
do for step 9 of breaststroke so you'll
start<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.930> you'll<00:01:16.710> slice<00:01:17.009> into<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> water

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
start off you'll slice into the water

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.270 
start off you'll slice into the water
you'll<00:01:18.030> pool<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> pull<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you'll pool and as you pull that's when

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560 
you'll pool and as you pull that's when
you'll<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.430> gliding<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.420> feet

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you'll be gliding with your feet

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
you'll be gliding with your feet
together<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> watch<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:22.979> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
together so as you watch me do it just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
together so as you watch me do it just
pay<00:01:23.430> attention<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.210> every<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.200> come

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pay attention to that every time I come

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.670 
pay attention to that every time I come
for<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> breath<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.549> legs<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:26.909> straight<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
for a breath my legs are straight up and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
for a breath my legs are straight up and
when<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:29.299> putting<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.450> hands<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:30.780> together

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
when I'm putting my hands back together

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.420 
when I'm putting my hands back together
in<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> prayer<00:01:31.380> position<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.920> slicing<00:01:32.280> into

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
in a prayer position and slicing into

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
in a prayer position and slicing into
the<00:01:32.579> water<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.180> kick<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> with

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the water that's when I kick and with

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
actually struggle as much and I can

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:17.180 
actually struggle as much and I can
still<00:02:05.130> move<00:02:05.280> quite<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> distance<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> if

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
still move quite a distance and if

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.480 
still move quite a distance and if
you've<00:02:17.340> noticed<00:02:18.770> every<00:02:19.770> time<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.280> legs

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
together and closed

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.730 
together and closed
I<00:02:21.780> waited<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> while<00:02:23.460> because<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.420> extra

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
I waited for a while because that extra

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.840 
I waited for a while because that extra
three<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.830> five<00:02:26.010> seconds<00:02:26.430> you're<00:02:26.550> actually

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
three to five seconds you're actually

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
three to five seconds you're actually
able<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.140> write<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.350> glide<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> little<00:02:28.950> bit

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
able to write that glide a little bit

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.890 
able to write that glide a little bit
more<00:02:29.460> than<00:02:29.730> cutting<00:02:30.060> yourself<00:02:30.150> short<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
more than cutting yourself short and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
more than cutting yourself short and
working<00:02:31.590> double
