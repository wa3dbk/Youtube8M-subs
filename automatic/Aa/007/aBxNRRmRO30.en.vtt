think<00:05:27.789> two<00:05:28.030> is<00:05:28.060> little<00:05:28.720> bit<00:05:28.870> larger<00:05:31.110> it's

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
think two is little bit larger it's

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.779 
think two is little bit larger it's

a<00:06:34.780> little<00:06:34.810> bit<00:06:35.020> more<00:06:35.290> so<00:06:35.770> it's<00:06:36.010> called<00:06:36.250> bad<00:06:36.460> so

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
a little bit more so it's called bad so

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.310 
a little bit more so it's called bad so
you<00:06:36.850> can<00:06:36.940> use<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.360> pretty<00:06:37.570> much<00:06:37.780> all<00:06:37.960> over<00:06:38.230> the
