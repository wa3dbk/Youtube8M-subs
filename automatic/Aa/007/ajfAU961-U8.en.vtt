00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the holes it's a direct plug pressure

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.240 
the holes it's a direct plug pressure
you<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.410> blow<00:00:52.620> across<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you don't blow across it like a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
you don't blow across it like a
transverse<00:00:53.730> flute<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.329> put<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:54.660> mouth

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
transverse flute I actually put my mouth

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
transverse flute I actually put my mouth
right<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.890> white<00:00:56.699> area<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.620> blowing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
right over this white area I'm blowing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
right over this white area I'm blowing
and<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.850> enough<00:01:00.090> pressure<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> actually

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and use enough pressure to actually

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
and use enough pressure to actually
inflate<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.260> cheeks<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
inflate your cheeks like this if you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
inflate your cheeks like this if you
don't<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.790> enough<00:01:05.820> pressure<00:01:06.210> you'll<00:01:06.540> get

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
don't use enough pressure you'll get

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
don't use enough pressure you'll get
kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> low<00:01:07.500> squawk<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> lift

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
kind of a low squawk and when you lift

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.310

fingers<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.909> nothing<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.210> happen

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:31.290 

so<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.560> increase<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> pressure

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.010 

got<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.860> kind<00:01:33.370> of<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.820> suppose<00:01:34.000> clarinet<00:01:34.690> oboe

easy<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.430> play<00:01:39.580> once<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:39.880> get<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.120> pressure

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
easy to play once you get that pressure

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.680 
easy to play once you get that pressure
right<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.220> one<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:42.790> showing<00:01:43.000> here<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.360> an<00:01:43.480> a
