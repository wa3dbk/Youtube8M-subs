 Dominik marx in the follow video I show 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.420
 you as you start with your mac 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.420
 sound could switch off permanently 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.650
 One of the same way the tip I have in 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.990
 the great google + community apple plus 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.759
 community read the whole link i 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.050
 on the one hand in the video description and 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.340
 dazzle that here 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.439
 if you feel like just have a look 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.390
 I did not know about that until now 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.460
 I always put the sound on 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.420
 if I did not want to hear the gong 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.010
 but there is another 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 Of course I can not do that for you 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.769
 withheld wants to start first 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.870
 you at your mac the terminal and with it 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.579
 he does not do that under user rights 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.119
 let's start with the command 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.710
 sudo su superuser rights so that we 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.159
 to play god on the system, so to speak 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.339
 can use the command nvr system of the 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.189
 volume is equal to 80 , you write 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.780
 just in the forums purely that the in 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.820
 quotes start-up sound 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.479
 Just let me know 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 with change 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.960
 now that is in nvm in it but what is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.140
 the nva 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.000
 For example, there is data in it like loud 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.530
 are the speakers say that we have 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.810
 just made how high is that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.240
 screen resolution for example the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.850
 selection of the state volumes and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.130
 Information about the last grains error 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.620
 if such exists at all 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.230
 It should be said at this point if 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.840
 according to apple care or the support 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.330
 documents or my first aid video 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.729
 proceed and empirum reset then does 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.560
 is also what we are doing right now 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.280
 get away and you should do that once 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 to repeat 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.140
 so that your start sound is gone too if 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.909
 Now you undo the whole thing again 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.830
 wanted to do that is the origin 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.560
 restore the behavior of the macs 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.990
 then again under superuser 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:02.330
 right the command nv - d system audio 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.590
 confirm volume with enter and yes 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.610
 you have the original one again 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.950
 State 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.599
 Please respects it with him, I command 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.879
 post it also in the video description 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.519
 it is important that you that it is the a 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.379
 and that v writes here just like me 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.430
 that's what big letters do 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.870
 more there is to actually do not 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.280
