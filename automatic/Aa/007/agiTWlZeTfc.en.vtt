00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.200 
gonna add pulp to the vet now normally I
add<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.470> three<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> four<00:01:49.710> scoops<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.880> pulp

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
add about three to four scoops of pulp

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
add about three to four scoops of pulp
but<00:01:51.659> sometimes<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.649> more

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
but sometimes you need a little bit more

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.319 
but sometimes you need a little bit more
and<00:01:53.100> sometimes<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.820> might<00:01:53.970> need<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> little

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and sometimes you might need a little

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.050 
and sometimes you might need a little
less<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:55.439> considering<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.490> thick<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
less also considering how thick do you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
less also considering how thick do you
want<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.420> sheets<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> paper<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
want your sheets of paper because the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
want your sheets of paper because the
slurry<00:01:59.729> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> mixture<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> pulp<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
slurry which is the mixture of pulp and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
slurry which is the mixture of pulp and
water<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> proportion<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
water is really just a proportion of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
water is really just a proportion of
pulp<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.280> water<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.270> thin

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
pulp to water so if you want really thin

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
pulp to water so if you want really thin
sheets<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> might<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> add<00:02:08.250> as

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
sheets then you might not want to add as

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
sheets then you might not want to add as
much<00:02:08.520> pulp<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.569> really

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
much pulp and if you want really really

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050 
much pulp and if you want really really
thick<00:02:10.530> sheets<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> course<00:02:11.790> you're<00:02:11.910> gonna

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
thick sheets then of course you're gonna

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.800 
thick sheets then of course you're gonna
add<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.540> bit

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
add a little bit

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.720 
add a little bit
more<00:02:12.930> poll<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> add

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
more poll so for this I'm going to add

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.790 
more poll so for this I'm going to add
about<00:02:15.090> three<00:02:15.420> scoops<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.900> pulp<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
about three scoops of pulp now as a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.309 
about three scoops of pulp now as a
rough<00:02:20.040> estimate<00:02:20.250> I'm<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.360> say<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.020> I'm

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
rough estimate I'm gonna say that I'm

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.520 
rough estimate I'm gonna say that I'm
gonna<00:02:22.470> add<00:02:22.739> 8<00:02:23.099> cups<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.730> pulp<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.540> 1<00:02:24.840> gallon<00:02:25.140> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
gonna add 8 cups of pulp to 1 gallon of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
gonna add 8 cups of pulp to 1 gallon of
water

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
water

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:41.530 
water
so<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.470> case<00:02:29.540> I'm<00:02:30.540> adding<00:02:30.860> four<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.040> these

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.320 

right<00:02:42.540> now<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.980> gently<00:02:44.330> sort

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
right now I'm just going to gently sort

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.600 
right now I'm just going to gently sort
of<00:02:45.420> stir<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> around<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:47.040> make<00:02:47.280> sure<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
of stir it around and make sure the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.479 
of stir it around and make sure the
consistency<00:02:48.360> feels<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:49.470> too<00:02:49.709> thick<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.280> not

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
consistency feels not too thick or not

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.800 
consistency feels not too thick or not
too<00:02:50.700> thin<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:53.160> right<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
too thin and just about right in the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
too thin and just about right in the
next<00:02:55.019> clip<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.319> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.590> showing<00:02:55.890> you
