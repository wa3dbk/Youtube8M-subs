hi<00:00:11.190> I'm<00:00:11.460> Jennifer<00:00:11.880> miniball<00:00:12.360> design<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
hi I'm Jennifer miniball design and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.859 
hi I'm Jennifer miniball design and
today<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:14.030> new<00:00:15.030> RC<00:00:15.570> helicopter<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
today I got my new RC helicopter it's a

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.470 
today I got my new RC helicopter it's a
Chinook<00:00:19.250> cargo<00:00:20.250> chopper<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.480> think

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
Chinook cargo chopper and it's I think

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.769 
Chinook cargo chopper and it's I think
18<00:00:25.019> inches<00:00:25.439> tip<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> tip<00:00:26.430> has<00:00:26.970> two<00:00:27.330> sets<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
18 inches tip to tip has two sets of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.919 
18 inches tip to tip has two sets of
blades<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.480> from<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> can

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
blades on it and from what I can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.770 
blades on it and from what I can
determine<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:32.030> basically<00:00:33.030> designed<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> fly

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
determine is basically designed to fly

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.950 
determine is basically designed to fly
outside<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> dead<00:00:35.219> calm<00:00:35.489> day<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.600> really

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
outside on a dead calm day it's really

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.049 
outside on a dead calm day it's really
with<00:00:37.230> me<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.710> controllable<00:00:38.309> enough<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> fly

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
with me not controllable enough to fly

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.690 
with me not controllable enough to fly
inside<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.750> US<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.550> auditorium<00:00:41.550> or

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
inside the US i was in a auditorium or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.030 
inside the US i was in a auditorium or
basketball<00:00:42.239> court<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.989> maybe<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> were

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
basketball court but maybe if you were

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
basketball court but maybe if you were
skilled<00:00:44.370> enough<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.570> there's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
skilled enough now there's a couple of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.910 
skilled enough now there's a couple of
things<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.100> i<00:00:47.309> found<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:48.379> if<00:00:49.379> anybody

things about this i found out if anybody

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.240 
things about this i found out if anybody
is<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> buy<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:52.620> has<00:00:52.890> true

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
is going to buy one is it has true

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.970 
is going to buy one is it has true
buttons<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.570> forward<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> backwards

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
buttons on it but forward and backwards

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.779 
buttons on it but forward and backwards
and<00:00:56.190> left<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> spin<00:00:57.090> left<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> spin<00:00:57.899> right

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and left and spin left and spin right

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.069 
and left and spin left and spin right
the<00:00:59.789> only<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.090> I've<00:01:00.270> been<00:01:00.420> able<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> fly<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the only way I've been able to fly it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
the only way I've been able to fly it
and<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.829> forward<00:01:02.340> speed<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.870> trim<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and have any forward speed is to trim it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.789 
and have any forward speed is to trim it
so<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.119> trimmed<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.810> fly<00:01:07.049> forward<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so that it's trimmed to fly forward and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
so that it's trimmed to fly forward and
then<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.869> tend<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
then when you go to take off it tend to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.080 
then when you go to take off it tend to
lift<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> tail<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.130> i<00:01:11.630> went<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> takeoff<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
lift the tail first i went on takeoff I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
lift the tail first i went on takeoff I
hold<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.330> stick<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.590> off

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
hold back stick on it to get to take off

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
hold back stick on it to get to take off
level<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> let<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.990> stick

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
level that way when I let go the stick

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
level that way when I let go the stick
gets<00:01:19.380> flying<00:01:19.740> forward<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
gets flying forward a little bit so the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
gets flying forward a little bit so the
hover<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> hold<00:01:21.570> back<00:01:21.780> stick<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
hover I have to hold back stick if I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
hover I have to hold back stick if I
trim<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> hover<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> push

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
trim it to hover then when I push

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.710 
trim it to hover then when I push
forward<00:01:25.229> stick<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.830> no<00:01:25.979> forward<00:01:26.430> motion

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
forward stick I have no forward motion

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
forward stick I have no forward motion
that's<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.380> once<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.009> used<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that's just once you get used to that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
that's just once you get used to that
hit<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.180> figure<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.869> okay<00:01:31.290> then

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
hit and figure it out it's okay then

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
hit and figure it out it's okay then
when<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.070> flying<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.579> basically<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
when you're flying it basically all you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
when you're flying it basically all you
are<00:01:33.450> doing<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.900> two<00:01:34.710> things<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
are doing is two things one is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
are doing is two things one is
controlling<00:01:35.970> elevation<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> left<00:01:36.930> stick

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
controlling elevation with a left stick

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
controlling elevation with a left stick
which<00:01:37.710> by<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.100> does<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> lock<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> let

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
which by the way does a lock if you let

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.160 
which by the way does a lock if you let
go<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> goes<00:01:39.840> BAM<00:01:40.380> ray<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> zero<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
go but it goes BAM ray down to zero and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
go but it goes BAM ray down to zero and
using<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.470> stick<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.490> control<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
using the right stick to control the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
using the right stick to control the
nose<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.200> keep<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> straight<00:01:46.950> line

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
nose to keep it in a straight line

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
nose to keep it in a straight line
because<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.020> trying

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
because this thing is a lot like trying

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
because this thing is a lot like trying
to<00:01:49.320> push<00:01:49.560> chain<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.329> hard<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> keep

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to push chain it's really hard to keep

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590 
to push chain it's really hard to keep
it<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> straight<00:01:52.320> line<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.360> fairly

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it in a straight line but it's a fairly

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.679 
it in a straight line but it's a fairly
high<00:01:54.720> quality<00:01:55.350> machine<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.909> quite

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
high quality machine and I'm quite

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.889 
high quality machine and I'm quite
impressed<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> money<00:01:59.299> if<00:02:00.299> anything

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
impressed with for the money if anything

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.130 
impressed with for the money if anything

a<00:02:09.890> person<00:02:10.490> who<00:02:10.520> us<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.660> am<00:02:12.170> guessing<00:02:12.500> by<00:02:13.220> a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
a person who us I am guessing by a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.510 
a person who us I am guessing by a
Chinese<00:02:13.730> person<00:02:14.000> who<00:02:14.240> studied<00:02:14.750> English<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.069> I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
Chinese person who studied English and I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.790 
Chinese person who studied English and I
think<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.569> guys<00:02:17.750> know<00:02:17.990> how<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.319> reads<00:02:18.620> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
think you guys know how this reads I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.140 
think you guys know how this reads I
don't<00:02:19.010> need<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.220> read<00:02:19.400> anything<00:02:19.670> out<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:19.970> it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
don't need to read anything out of it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.070 
don't need to read anything out of it
but<00:02:21.250> yeah<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:23.000> really<00:02:23.270> got<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.570> read<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.840> four

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
but yeah you really got to read it four

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.600 
but yeah you really got to read it four
or<00:02:24.110> five<00:02:24.290> times<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:24.980> I'm<00:02:25.130> still<00:02:25.430> not

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
or five times and then I'm still not

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.330 
or five times and then I'm still not
sure<00:02:25.670> what<00:02:26.630> they're<00:02:26.840> talking<00:02:27.200> about<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.010> once

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
sure what they're talking about so once

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.490 
sure what they're talking about so once
this<00:02:28.490> charge<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.209> I'm<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.959> try<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
this charge is up I'm going to try to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.460 
this charge is up I'm going to try to
get<00:02:30.950> some<00:02:31.280> footage<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> here<00:02:32.360> flying<00:02:33.170> I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
get some footage of it here flying I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
get some footage of it here flying I
know<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.830> can<00:02:33.920> or<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.340> because<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.940> don't

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
know that I can or not because I don't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.880 
know that I can or not because I don't
have<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.510> camera<00:02:35.780> man<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.290> means<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.709> going

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
have a camera man that means I'm going

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.350 
have a camera man that means I'm going
to<00:02:36.950> be<00:02:37.070> flying<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.790> trying<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.239> it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
to be flying it and trying to get it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.479 
to be flying it and trying to get it
close<00:02:39.140> enough<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.709> right<00:02:39.890> area<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
close enough in the right area so the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.640 
close enough in the right area so the
camera<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.450> good<00:02:42.260> luck<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.620> that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
camera can see it good luck with that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.310 
camera can see it good luck with that
right<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> I'll<00:02:44.510> turn<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.840> camera<00:02:45.110> back<00:02:45.140> on

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
right so I'll turn the camera back on

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.229 
right so I'll turn the camera back on
let's<00:02:45.890> think<00:02:46.070> charged<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.580> we'll<00:02:46.790> see<00:02:46.820> we<00:02:47.090> can

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
let's think charged up we'll see we can

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.110 
let's think charged up we'll see we can
crash<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.860> cord<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.550> comes<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.090> it

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
crash it the cord that comes with it

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
crash it the cord that comes with it
doesn't<00:02:53.690> pull<00:02:53.840> out<00:02:54.019> far<00:02:54.290> enough<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.769> charge<00:02:55.010> it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
doesn't pull out far enough to charge it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.090 
doesn't pull out far enough to charge it
with<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> chopper<00:02:56.030> laying<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:57.080> its<00:02:57.470> landing

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
with a chopper laying on its landing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.530 
with a chopper laying on its landing
gear<00:02:58.250> out<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.430> why<00:02:58.700> they<00:02:58.850> did<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.239> they

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
gear out and why they did that but they

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.259 
gear out and why they did that but they
did<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.709> can<00:03:00.980> see<00:03:01.310> I'm<00:03:01.670> trying<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.150> get

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
did and you can see I'm trying to get

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:12.039 
did and you can see I'm trying to get
this<00:03:09.880> now<00:03:10.880> another<00:03:11.180> odd<00:03:11.420> thing<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.750> this

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
this now another odd thing is this

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.850 
this now another odd thing is this
doesn't<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.739> any<00:03:12.920> swash<00:03:13.280> plates<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
doesn't have any swash plates so the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.770 
doesn't have any swash plates so the
only<00:03:16.010> way<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.610> really<00:03:16.670> fly<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.329> is

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
only way you can really fly it is

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.400 
only way you can really fly it is
forward<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.620> backwards<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.750> spin<00:03:20.750> there<00:03:21.170> is

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
forward and backwards and spin there is

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.660 
forward and backwards and spin there is
no<00:03:21.620> left<00:03:22.280> or<00:03:22.489> right<00:03:22.760> drift<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:25.190> doesn't<00:03:25.519> work

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
no left or right drift it doesn't work

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.270 
no left or right drift it doesn't work
that<00:03:25.700> way<00:03:26.060> no<00:03:26.480> first<00:03:26.780> place<00:03:27.110> how<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.769> works<00:03:27.950> is

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that way no first place how it works is

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.910 
that way no first place how it works is
you<00:03:28.579> vary<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> speed<00:03:29.840> on<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> front<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.680> back

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
you vary the speed on the front and back

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.190 
you vary the speed on the front and back
rotor<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:32.239> will<00:03:32.420> give<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.750> forward

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
rotor and that will give you forward

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.970 
rotor and that will give you forward
reverse<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.329> if<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.590> want<00:03:36.890> to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
reverse and if the if it if you want to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
reverse and if the if it if you want to
turn<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.370> spin<00:03:37.610> left<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.030> spin<00:03:38.269> right<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:38.840> does

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
turn and spin left to spin right it does

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.810 
turn and spin left to spin right it does
the<00:03:39.410> same<00:03:39.470> thing<00:03:39.860> changes<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> speed<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
the same thing changes the speed of the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.270 
the same thing changes the speed of the
rotas<00:03:41.239> get<00:03:41.480> spin<00:03:41.780> left<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.200> spin<00:03:42.440> right<00:03:42.620> so

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
rotas get spin left and spin right so

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.400 
rotas get spin left and spin right so
there<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.519> no<00:03:43.820> sideways<00:03:44.450> motion<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.079> it<00:03:45.230> which

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
there is no sideways motion on it which

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.800 
there is no sideways motion on it which
makes<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.310> little<00:03:46.459> odd<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.910> fly<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.299> say<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
makes it a little odd to fly to say the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:05:42.399 
makes it a little odd to fly to say the
least

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:06:02.059 

Leia<00:05:43.409> I<00:05:43.830> wasn't<00:05:44.430> too<00:05:44.580> bad<00:06:00.319> ok<00:06:01.319> guys<00:06:01.560> one<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.889> the

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
Leia I wasn't too bad ok guys one of the

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.580 
Leia I wasn't too bad ok guys one of the
things<00:06:02.340> i<00:06:02.520> learned<00:06:02.759> about<00:06:02.999> this<00:06:03.479> this<00:06:04.020> time<00:06:04.319> is

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
things i learned about this this time is

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.550 
things i learned about this this time is
see<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.580> antenna<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.629> came<00:06:06.990> with<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.319> wrapped

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
see this antenna it came with it wrapped

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.700 
see this antenna it came with it wrapped
around<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:08.009> landing<00:06:08.370> gear<00:06:08.669> wherever<00:06:09.449> I<00:06:09.840> found

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
around the landing gear wherever I found

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.100 
around the landing gear wherever I found
out<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:10.919> I<00:06:11.129> had<00:06:11.159> a<00:06:11.370> lot<00:06:11.610> better<00:06:11.789> lock<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.449> it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
out that I had a lot better lock and it

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.929 
out that I had a lot better lock and it
seemed<00:06:13.379> to<00:06:13.469> be<00:06:13.529> much<00:06:13.770> more<00:06:13.800> responsive<00:06:14.460> and

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
seemed to be much more responsive and

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.619 
seemed to be much more responsive and
not<00:06:15.180> be<00:06:15.389> prone<00:06:15.719> to<00:06:15.990> go<00:06:16.999> Mustang<00:06:17.999> every<00:06:18.300> now<00:06:18.449> and

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
not be prone to go Mustang every now and

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.499 
not be prone to go Mustang every now and
then<00:06:18.779> if<00:06:19.199> i<00:06:19.379> left<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.889> antenna<00:06:20.509> drooping

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
then if i left the antenna drooping

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.339 
then if i left the antenna drooping
below<00:06:21.870> it<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.289> think<00:06:22.979> what<00:06:23.189> was<00:06:23.310> happening<00:06:23.849> was

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
below it I think what was happening was

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.600 
below it I think what was happening was
sometimes<00:06:25.349> I<00:06:25.469> be<00:06:25.589> flying<00:06:25.860> outside<00:06:26.069> it<00:06:26.460> would

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
sometimes I be flying outside it would

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.999 
sometimes I be flying outside it would
kind<00:06:27.089> of<00:06:27.150> have<00:06:27.419> a<00:06:27.449> life<00:06:27.779> of<00:06:27.930> its<00:06:28.110> own<00:06:28.229> I<00:06:28.529> think

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
kind of have a life of its own I think

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.769 
kind of have a life of its own I think
it<00:06:29.129> was<00:06:29.189> hitting<00:06:29.490> I<00:06:29.729> had<00:06:30.180> it<00:06:30.300> wrapped<00:06:30.330> up

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:30.779 
it was hitting I had it wrapped up

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:31.969 
it was hitting I had it wrapped up
around<00:06:30.900> here<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.379> I<00:06:31.439> think<00:06:31.620> was<00:06:31.740> getting

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
around here and I think was getting

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.309 
around here and I think was getting
feedback<00:06:32.189> from<00:06:32.430> one<00:06:32.759> of<00:06:32.849> the<00:06:32.909> motives<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:34.020> I

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
feedback from one of the motives so I

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.230 
feedback from one of the motives so I
would<00:06:34.979> recommend<00:06:35.009> just<00:06:35.580> letting<00:06:35.879> it<00:06:35.939> hang

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
would recommend just letting it hang

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.739 
would recommend just letting it hang
down<00:06:37.580> below<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.759> machine<00:06:39.089> when<00:06:39.330> it's<00:06:39.479> flying

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:39.749 
down below the machine when it's flying

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.760 
down below the machine when it's flying
second<00:06:40.680> thing<00:06:40.830> is<00:06:41.180> you<00:06:42.180> get<00:06:42.360> maybe<00:06:42.629> an<00:06:43.199> eight

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
second thing is you get maybe an eight

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.920 
second thing is you get maybe an eight
minute<00:06:43.979> flight<00:06:44.370> on<00:06:44.729> a<00:06:44.759> battery<00:06:45.029> but<00:06:45.629> it<00:06:45.750> takes

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
minute flight on a battery but it takes

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.990 
minute flight on a battery but it takes
like<00:06:46.139> an<00:06:46.259> hour<00:06:46.319> to<00:06:46.710> completely<00:06:47.310> charged<00:06:47.610> it<00:06:47.849> so

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
like an hour to completely charged it so

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.089 
like an hour to completely charged it so
that's<00:06:48.750> something<00:06:48.990> to<00:06:49.169> think<00:06:49.289> about<00:06:49.500> too<00:06:49.889> and

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
that's something to think about too and

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.010 
that's something to think about too and
the<00:06:50.460> battery<00:06:50.819> is<00:06:50.939> kind<00:06:51.210> of<00:06:51.300> built<00:06:51.539> into<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:51.990> so

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
the battery is kind of built into it so

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.839 
the battery is kind of built into it so
you<00:06:52.169> can't<00:06:52.379> just<00:06:52.469> pop<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:52.949> out<00:06:53.039> and<00:06:53.219> pop

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
you can't just pop it out and pop

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.639 
you can't just pop it out and pop
another<00:06:54.089> one<00:06:54.330> in<00:06:54.509> so<00:06:54.960> I'm<00:06:55.139> tending<00:06:55.469> for

another one in so I'm tending for
