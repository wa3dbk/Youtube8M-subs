00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the lower eyelids our skin doesn't sag

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.920 
the lower eyelids our skin doesn't sag
it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.160> from<00:02:05.460> gravity<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.270> loss<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's not from gravity it's from loss of

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's not from gravity it's from loss of
the<00:02:07.470> natural<00:02:07.950> body<00:02:08.069> filler<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> fat<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the natural body filler which is fat and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470 
the natural body filler which is fat and
so<00:02:10.170> we're<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.039> using<00:02:11.340> fat<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.239> more

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
so we're now using fat more and more

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.300 
so we're now using fat more and more
around<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> eye<00:02:13.110> list<00:02:13.500> try<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> give<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> more

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
around the eye list try to give a more

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.210 
around the eye list try to give a more
youthful<00:02:14.580> look<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.769> terms<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
youthful look and then in terms of

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.949 
youthful look and then in terms of
addressing<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.849> skin<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.390> eyelid<00:02:18.599> we're

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
addressing the skin of the eyelid we're

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.869 
addressing the skin of the eyelid we're
trying<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.349> be<00:02:19.500> much<00:02:19.739> less<00:02:20.040> aggressive<00:02:20.190> we're

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
trying to be much less aggressive we're

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.899 
trying to be much less aggressive we're
avoiding<00:02:21.980> operating<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.190> muscle<00:02:23.519> itself

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
avoiding operating on the muscle itself

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.210 
avoiding operating on the muscle itself
so<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> patient<00:02:24.750> maintains<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:26.010> nice

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so the patient maintains that nice

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.369 
so the patient maintains that nice
natural<00:02:26.549> lower<00:02:26.940> eyelid<00:02:27.330> shape<00:02:27.599> we're<00:02:28.110> trying

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
natural lower eyelid shape we're trying

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.680 
natural lower eyelid shape we're trying
to<00:02:28.500> achieve<00:02:28.830> more<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.670> we're<00:02:29.819> being<00:02:30.030> less

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to achieve more but we're being less

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140 
to achieve more but we're being less
aggressive<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:32.069> process<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> end

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
aggressive in that process and the end

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.360 
aggressive in that process and the end
result<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.349> really<00:02:34.560> been<00:02:34.680> borne<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.099> by

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
result and it's really been borne out by

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.100 
result and it's really been borne out by
a<00:02:35.400> lot<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.819> nice<00:02:35.970> results<00:02:36.420> presented<00:02:36.810> here

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
a lot of the nice results presented here

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.869 
a lot of the nice results presented here
is<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.769> patients<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> very<00:02:38.610> nice

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
is that patients have a very nice

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.920 
is that patients have a very nice
natural<00:02:39.690> relaxed<00:02:40.319> rested<00:02:41.129> look<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.090> they're

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
natural relaxed rested look but they're

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.690 
natural relaxed rested look but they're
not<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.530> through<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.950> procedures<00:02:44.099> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
not going through these procedures that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
not going through these procedures that
have<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:45.239> long<00:02:45.420> recoveries<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.709> give

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
have very long recoveries and that give

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.339 
have very long recoveries and that give
them<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.069> pulled<00:02:47.430> look<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.030> distorts<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
them a pulled look or that distorts the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.949 
them a pulled look or that distorts the
lower<00:02:49.500> eyelid<00:02:49.920> shape<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.510> terms<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
lower eyelid shape so in terms of the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.509 
lower eyelid shape so in terms of the
fat<00:02:52.140> grafting<00:02:52.590> how<00:02:52.739> does<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.040> work<00:02:53.250> where

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
fat grafting how does that work where

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.309 
fat grafting how does that work where
does<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> fat<00:02:53.940> come<00:02:54.180> from<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:54.840> process

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
does the fat come from and what process

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.809 
does the fat come from and what process
does<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.590> go<00:02:55.739> through<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:56.250> surgeons<00:02:56.670> can

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
does it go through that surgeons can

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.819 
does it go through that surgeons can
then<00:02:56.970> use<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.359> as<00:02:57.540> part<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.109> eyelid

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
then use it as part of the eyelid

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.210 
then use it as part of the eyelid
surgery<00:02:59.400> well<00:02:59.609> as<00:02:59.819> you<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.620> most<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.829> us<00:03:01.980> have

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
surgery well as you know most of us have

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180 
surgery well as you know most of us have
some<00:03:02.519> fat<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:03.599> we<00:03:03.720> don't<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.440> certain

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
some fat that we don't like in certain

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.280 
some fat that we don't like in certain
areas<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.910> classic<00:03:06.660> comment<00:03:07.049> from<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
areas and the classic comment from the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.559 
areas and the classic comment from the
patient<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.859> I'm<00:03:08.280> losing<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.910> fat<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.209> my<00:03:09.299> face

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
patient is I'm losing the fat in my face

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.199 
patient is I'm losing the fat in my face
and<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.019> going<00:03:10.349> elsewhere<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and it's going elsewhere and so the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.780 
and it's going elsewhere and so the
concept<00:03:12.780> now<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.230> taking<00:03:13.530> some<00:03:13.980> fat<00:03:14.549> from

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
concept now is taking some fat from

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.670 
concept now is taking some fat from
other<00:03:14.970> parts<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> body<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.560> this

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
other parts of the body and we do this

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.129 
other parts of the body and we do this
utilizing<00:03:17.489> some<00:03:17.819> slightly<00:03:18.660> modified

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
utilizing some slightly modified

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.990 
utilizing some slightly modified
liposuction<00:03:20.010> techniques<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.669> that<00:03:20.700> we're

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
liposuction techniques so that we're

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.559 
liposuction techniques so that we're
preserving<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.260> fat<00:03:22.500> cells<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.359> then<00:03:24.359> we're

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
preserving the fat cells and then we're

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.509 
preserving the fat cells and then we're
transferring<00:03:25.139> these<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.250> very<00:03:26.430> small

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
transferring these in the very small

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.449 
transferring these in the very small
syringes<00:03:27.329> using<00:03:27.750> very<00:03:28.019> small<00:03:28.190> blunt<00:03:29.190> tip

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
syringes using very small blunt tip

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.759 
syringes using very small blunt tip
needles<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.180> actually<00:03:30.599> put<00:03:31.139> this<00:03:31.290> fat<00:03:31.500> where

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
needles to actually put this fat where

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.309 
needles to actually put this fat where
it's<00:03:31.889> needed<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.690> most<00:03:33.870> exciting

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
it's needed one of the most exciting

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.559 
it's needed one of the most exciting
things<00:03:34.799> about<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.489> new<00:03:35.849> trim<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.389> fat

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
things about this new trim and fat

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.659 
things about this new trim and fat
grafting<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.709> now<00:03:37.859> understand<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.549> it's

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
grafting is we now understand that it's

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.509 
grafting is we now understand that it's
not<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:40.019> fat<00:03:40.260> cells<00:03:40.620> there's<00:03:41.069> actually

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
not just the fat cells there's actually

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.699 
not just the fat cells there's actually
growth<00:03:41.760> factors<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.959> they're<00:03:43.109> even<00:03:43.260> stem

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
growth factors and and they're even stem

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.370 
growth factors and and they're even stem
cells<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.459> all<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:45.000> our<00:03:45.120> fat<00:03:45.419> and<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.109> think

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
cells and all of our fat and we think

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.629 
cells and all of our fat and we think
that<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:46.829> of<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.010> effect<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.489> we're

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
that a lot of the effect that we're

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.339 
that a lot of the effect that we're
getting<00:03:47.760> from<00:03:48.030> these<00:03:48.269> fat<00:03:48.510> grafting<00:03:49.019> is

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
getting from these fat grafting is

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.710 
getting from these fat grafting is
actually<00:03:49.919> from<00:03:50.099> those<00:03:50.310> other<00:03:50.519> components<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
actually from those other components of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
actually from those other components of
the<00:03:51.959> fat<00:03:52.139> grafts<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.739> that's<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:53.010> very<00:03:53.220> exciting

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
the fat grafts so that's a very exciting

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.550 
the fat grafts so that's a very exciting
area<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.450> there's<00:03:54.569> an<00:03:54.720> enormous<00:03:54.959> amount<00:03:55.290> of

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
area and there's an enormous amount of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.809 
area and there's an enormous amount of
research<00:03:55.889> being<00:03:56.160> done<00:03:56.280> right

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
research being done right

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.910 
research being done right
this<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.569> terms<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.140> patients<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.769> terms

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
this in terms of the patients in terms

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.559 
this in terms of the patients in terms
of<00:03:59.099> being<00:03:59.249> practical<00:03:59.760> about<00:03:59.939> it<00:03:59.999> what<00:04:00.269> we<00:04:00.390> do

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
of being practical about it what we do

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.020 
of being practical about it what we do
is<00:04:00.749> we<00:04:00.959> will<00:04:01.590> take<00:04:02.069> some<00:04:02.249> fat<00:04:02.489> from<00:04:02.700> elsewhere

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
is we will take some fat from elsewhere

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.050 
is we will take some fat from elsewhere
and<00:04:03.889> we<00:04:04.889> want<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.129> do<00:04:05.219> a<00:04:05.249> little<00:04:05.370> liposuction

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
and we want to do a little liposuction

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.369 
and we want to do a little liposuction
that<00:04:06.150> area<00:04:06.480> that's<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.749> great<00:04:06.930> time<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.200> do<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
that area that's a great time to do that

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.470 
that area that's a great time to do that
as<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.129> then<00:04:08.519> we<00:04:08.609> prepare<00:04:08.999> that<00:04:09.239> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
as well and then we prepare that and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.869 
as well and then we prepare that and
using<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:10.530> very<00:04:11.370> small<00:04:13.280> incisions<00:04:14.280> or<00:04:14.519> even

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
using very very small incisions or even

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.089 
using very very small incisions or even
just<00:04:15.060> using<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.359> needle<00:04:15.689> to<00:04:16.199> pass<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.769> blunt

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
just using a needle to pass this blunt

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.800 
just using a needle to pass this blunt
tip<00:04:17.400> needle<00:04:17.789> right<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.180> where<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.299> fat<00:04:18.539> needs

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
tip needle right to where the fat needs

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.210 
tip needle right to where the fat needs
to<00:04:18.930> go<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:19.470> very<00:04:19.590> safe

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
to go so it's very safe

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.370 
to go so it's very safe
it<00:04:20.370> tends<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.699> be<00:04:20.820> very<00:04:20.970> effective<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:22.019> gives

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it tends to be very effective and gives

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.950 
it tends to be very effective and gives
long<00:04:22.650> lasting<00:04:23.099> results<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.360> what<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.810> have

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
long lasting results so what if you have

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.749 
long lasting results so what if you have
a<00:04:24.990> patient<00:04:25.229> who<00:04:25.650> may<00:04:25.830> be<00:04:25.889> just<00:04:26.130> very<00:04:26.160> slender

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
a patient who may be just very slender

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.370 
a patient who may be just very slender
and<00:04:26.970> doesn't<00:04:27.240> necessarily<00:04:27.300> need<00:04:28.199> any

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
and doesn't necessarily need any

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.800 
and doesn't necessarily need any
liposuction<00:04:29.009> or<00:04:29.099> or<00:04:29.430> have<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.210> place<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.599> you

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
liposuction or or have a place that you

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.719 
liposuction or or have a place that you
can<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.289> fat<00:04:31.470> from<00:04:31.770> or<00:04:31.919> their<00:04:32.039> alternate

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
can get the fat from or their alternate

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.370 
can get the fat from or their alternate
techniques<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.539> get<00:04:33.690> enough<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.259> you

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
techniques to just get enough that you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.560 
techniques to just get enough that you
need<00:04:34.590> well<00:04:35.220> there<00:04:35.340> are<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.270> almost

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
need well there are that you can almost

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.499 
need well there are that you can almost
always<00:04:37.020> find<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:38.370> small<00:04:38.669> quantities<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.180> fat

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
always find the small quantities of fat

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.240 
always find the small quantities of fat
that<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.870> need<00:04:40.050> around<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.470> eyelid<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.130> may

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
that you need around the eyelid you may

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.100 
that you need around the eyelid you may
not<00:04:41.430> be<00:04:41.550> able<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.699> find<00:04:41.970> enough<00:04:42.150> fat<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.419> use<00:04:42.930> in

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
not be able to find enough fat to use in

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.779 
not be able to find enough fat to use in
other<00:04:43.199> parts<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.680> face<00:04:43.979> but<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.400> terms<00:04:44.580> of

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
other parts of the face but in terms of

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.909 
other parts of the face but in terms of
the<00:04:45.330> eyelids<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.900> very<00:04:46.110> small<00:04:46.440> amount<00:04:46.770> and

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
the eyelids it's a very small amount and

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.510 
the eyelids it's a very small amount and
you<00:04:47.310> can<00:04:47.430> almost<00:04:47.699> always<00:04:48.060> find<00:04:48.389> that<00:04:48.630> fat

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
you can almost always find that fat

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.249 
you can almost always find that fat
there<00:04:50.520> are<00:04:50.669> some<00:04:50.970> patients<00:04:51.509> who<00:04:51.660> prefer<00:04:52.020> not

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
there are some patients who prefer not

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.080 
there are some patients who prefer not
to<00:04:52.289> have<00:04:52.560> something<00:04:52.889> else<00:04:53.009> done<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.940> those

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
to have something else done and in those

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.450 
to have something else done and in those
patients<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:55.080> use<00:04:55.289> one<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> dermal

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
patients you can use one of the dermal

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.580 
patients you can use one of the dermal
fillers<00:04:56.849> in<00:04:57.090> those<00:04:57.599> areas<00:04:58.050> now<00:04:58.259> you<00:04:58.320> have<00:04:58.500> to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
fillers in those areas now you have to

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
fillers in those areas now you have to
be<00:04:58.680> very<00:04:58.889> careful<00:04:59.430> with<00:04:59.580> those<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.030> also<00:05:00.539> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
be very careful with those and also the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.689 
be very careful with those and also the
patient<00:05:00.990> has<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.349> understand<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.490> is

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
patient has to understand that this is

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.680 
patient has to understand that this is
going<00:05:02.909> to<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.090> something<00:05:03.300> that's<00:05:03.449> going<00:05:03.630> to

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
going to be something that's going to

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.839 
going to be something that's going to
have<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.900> be<00:05:03.990> repeated<00:05:04.320> over<00:05:05.280> time<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.759> it's

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
have to be repeated over time and it's

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.219 
have to be repeated over time and it's
something<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.150> we<00:05:06.240> do<00:05:06.360> very<00:05:06.389> commonly<00:05:06.960> right

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
something that we do very commonly right

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.050 
something that we do very commonly right
there<00:05:07.409> in<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.590> clinic<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.759> doesn't

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
there in the clinic so that doesn't

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.520 
there in the clinic so that doesn't
require<00:05:09.389> a<00:05:09.479> trip<00:05:09.720> with<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.900> operating<00:05:10.349> room

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
require a trip with the operating room

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.100 
require a trip with the operating room
it<00:05:11.099> is<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.669> be<00:05:11.789> repeated<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.659> it<00:05:12.840> really

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
it is going to be repeated and it really

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.980 
it is going to be repeated and it really
requires<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.830> patient<00:05:14.190> or<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.479> the

requires the patient or that the the
surgeon<00:05:16.979> doing<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.370> technique<00:05:17.610> has<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.000> lot

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
surgeon doing this technique has a lot

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.029 
surgeon doing this technique has a lot
of<00:05:18.300> experience<00:05:18.900> with<00:05:19.020> those<00:05:19.199> fillers<00:05:19.590> because

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
of experience with those fillers because

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.399 
of experience with those fillers because
we've<00:05:20.759> all<00:05:20.909> seen<00:05:21.150> patients<00:05:21.389> with<00:05:21.720> with

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
we've all seen patients with with

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.529 
we've all seen patients with with
unnatural<00:05:22.710> appearing<00:05:23.400> lumps<00:05:24.150> or<00:05:24.330> other
