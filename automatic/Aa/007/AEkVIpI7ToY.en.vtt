00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
not all our concepts were supposed to

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.370 
not all our concepts were supposed to
like<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.410> let's<00:02:15.530> make<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.819> spot<00:02:17.380> harder

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
like that like let's make a spot harder

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.229 
like that like let's make a spot harder
or<00:02:18.620> add<00:02:19.069> substitute<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.819> would<00:02:19.970> make<00:02:20.120> it

or add substitute that would make it

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.580 
or add substitute that would make it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that would be legit if it was a real

that would be legit if it was a real
spot<00:02:21.860> everyone<00:02:22.610> was<00:02:22.730> sort<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.940> excited<00:02:23.300> about

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
spot everyone was sort of excited about

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.970 
spot everyone was sort of excited about
that<00:02:23.630> one<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:24.050> excited<00:02:24.290> about<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.860> it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
that one I was excited about it and it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.190 
that one I was excited about it and it
was<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.000> weird<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:26.959> first

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
was but it's weird to have your first

was but it's weird to have your first
plan<00:02:27.500> fall<00:02:28.459> through<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.569> did<00:02:29.930> ended

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
plan fall through like that we did ended

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.960 
plan fall through like that we did ended
up<00:02:30.500> taking<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.830> jump<00:02:31.130> ramp<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.550> made<00:02:31.700> for

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
up taking the jump ramp that we made for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
up taking the jump ramp that we made for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
the Euro gap and put it up to the tall

rails<00:02:33.590> around<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> park<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.550> somebody

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
rails around the park and somebody

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.660 
rails around the park and somebody
decided<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.069> we<00:02:37.160> could<00:02:37.310> launch<00:02:37.459> up

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
decided you know that we could launch up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.699 
decided you know that we could launch up
to<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> gate<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.930> started<00:02:39.230> launching<00:02:39.470> to

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
to the gate so we started launching to

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.670 
to the gate so we started launching to
the<00:02:39.800> gate<00:02:39.980> which<00:02:40.280> was<00:02:40.430> super<00:02:40.610> fun<00:02:40.880> too<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.680> Leo

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the gate which was super fun too and Leo

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.699 
the gate which was super fun too and Leo
get<00:02:43.370> some<00:02:43.580> sweet<00:02:44.150> mares<00:02:44.390> any<00:02:45.350> number<00:02:45.620> of

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
get some sweet mares any number of

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.100 
get some sweet mares any number of
things<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.010> can<00:02:46.160> go<00:02:46.220> wrong<00:02:46.489> do<00:02:47.360> usually<00:02:47.690> at

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
things that can go wrong do usually at

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.860 
things that can go wrong do usually at
least<00:02:48.170> one<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.660> sort<00:02:50.840> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
least one of them so it's sort of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.330 
least one of them so it's sort of
dealing<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.709> dealing<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:54.340> ideas

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
dealing with that and dealing with ideas

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.009 
dealing with that and dealing with ideas
it's<00:02:55.519> all<00:02:55.640> ideas<00:02:56.090> sometimes<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> idea

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
it's all ideas sometimes the idea

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's all ideas sometimes the idea
doesn't<00:02:57.170> work<00:02:57.440> out<00:02:57.830> like<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.190> thought<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.970> did

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
doesn't work out like you thought we did

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.910 
doesn't work out like you thought we did
this<00:02:59.239> thing<00:02:59.420> at<00:02:59.569> Belmont<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.590> head<00:03:00.769> that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
this thing at Belmont in my head that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.229 
this thing at Belmont in my head that
was<00:03:01.010> gonna<00:03:01.130> be<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.400> funnest<00:03:01.610> one<00:03:01.880> everyone's

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
was gonna be the funnest one everyone's

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.970 
was gonna be the funnest one everyone's
gonna<00:03:02.360> love<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.410> wasn't<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.709> good

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
gonna love it and it wasn't that good

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.920 
gonna love it and it wasn't that good
just<00:03:04.340> logistics<00:03:04.790> he<00:03:05.030> didn't<00:03:05.239> work<00:03:05.360> out<00:03:05.540> well

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
just logistics he didn't work out well

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.740 
just logistics he didn't work out well
the<00:03:06.079> original<00:03:06.290> idea<00:03:06.829> was<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.220> have<00:03:07.400> people

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the original idea was to have people

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.500 
the original idea was to have people
skate<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> stairs<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.950> then<00:03:10.730> hit<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
skate the stairs and then hit the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.140 
skate the stairs and then hit the
quarter<00:03:11.900> pipe<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.650> wall<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.640> idea<00:03:13.970> was

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
quarter pipe to the wall the idea was

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.410 
quarter pipe to the wall the idea was
kind<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.390> cool<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:15.700> making<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> obstacle

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
kind of cool that making the obstacle

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420 
kind of cool that making the obstacle
that<00:03:17.630> sort<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.989> pose<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.440> threat<00:03:18.470> after<00:03:19.040> you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that sort of pose the threat after you

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.030 
that sort of pose the threat after you
landed<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.150> kind<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.450> like<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:21.140> buzzkill<00:03:21.620> on

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
landed and kind of like is a buzzkill on

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.100 
landed and kind of like is a buzzkill on
on<00:03:22.430> your

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
on your

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.320 
on your
take<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.470> stairs<00:03:23.890> or<00:03:24.130> whatever<00:03:24.190> kind<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> like

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
take on stairs or whatever kind of like

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.630 
take on stairs or whatever kind of like
turn<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.320> into<00:03:26.500> something<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:27.130> have<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.460> sort

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
turn it into something you have to sort

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.460 
turn it into something you have to sort
of<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:27.970> try<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:29.020> it's<00:03:29.200> not<00:03:29.290> going

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
of do try it to know that it's not going

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.020 
of do try it to know that it's not going
to<00:03:29.530> work<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.890> think<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.250> won't<00:03:30.430> look<00:03:30.670> at<00:03:30.850> that

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
to work I think that won't look at that

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.130 
to work I think that won't look at that
paper<00:03:31.210> and<00:03:31.450> say<00:03:31.570> yeah<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.080> be

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
paper and say yeah it's going to be

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.280 
paper and say yeah it's going to be
great<00:03:32.350> but<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:34.180> wasn't<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.750> was<00:03:34.840> okay<00:03:35.050> people

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
great but it wasn't it was okay people

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.410 
great but it wasn't it was okay people
skated<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.800> at<00:03:36.010> fun<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.490> think<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.030> heavily

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
skated it at fun I think that heavily

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.720 
skated it at fun I think that heavily
provides<00:03:37.720> around<00:03:37.930> will<00:03:38.830> we<00:03:38.920> put<00:03:39.130> stuff<00:03:39.370> we<00:03:39.550> had

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
provides around will we put stuff we had

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.680 
provides around will we put stuff we had
and<00:03:39.970> then<00:03:40.180> nothing

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
and then nothing

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.540 
and then nothing
I<00:03:41.720> originally<00:03:42.650> thought<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.070> totally

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
I originally thought but totally

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.760 
I originally thought but totally
