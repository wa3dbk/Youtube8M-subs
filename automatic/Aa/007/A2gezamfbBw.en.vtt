showers back a guy who gives them a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.640 
showers back a guy who gives them a
little<00:02:58.090> different<00:02:58.480> look<00:02:58.660> he's<00:02:59.200> able<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.530> get

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
little different look he's able to get

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.170 
little different look he's able to get
off<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.010> edge<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.400> mean<00:03:00.520> that's<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.790> boost<00:03:01.030> for

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
off the edge I mean that's a boost for

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.120 
off the edge I mean that's a boost for
the<00:03:01.300> offense<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.140> gives<00:03:02.410> Murphy<00:03:02.890> another

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
the offense so it gives Murphy another
