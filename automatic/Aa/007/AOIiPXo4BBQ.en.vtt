00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 human history knows a lot 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.390
 cases of genocide since the oldest 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.519
 times of genocide of Jews and Gypsies during 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 World War II Nazi Germany 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 the destruction of Armenians and Assyrians in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.299
 Ottoman Empire extermination kurdish 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 Iraqi population of northern iraq 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.869
 the case of genocide troops are also found in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.760
 Nowadays 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 how to learn from the past and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.109
 fight genocide talked today on 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
 International Forum in Moscow 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 scholars and public figures and politicians 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 different countries on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the genocide 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire said that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 do not forget about the events that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 killed millions of people destroyed 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 the fate of several generations of the more 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.879
 that now in the world of religion 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.850
 social hatred escalated 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.360
 tragedies and genocides is very valine 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.550
 hurt despite the fact that it is for many 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 nations as it were far away but it is very 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.489
 hurts this is very hot topic 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.120
 still we think for what we are 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 doing 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 probably to one side 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 never against any people 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 it did not happen again 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.890
 forum participants spoke peaceful life 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.229
 always remains a fragile value 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 wounded evidence of how the war is on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.869
 Ukraine, a wave of violence 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.790
 today at the very borders of the Russian 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.040
 federations 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:28.190
 we see that the metastases between in religious 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.640
 hate national intransigence 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.120
 social aggression sprout the most 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 different parts of our planet just like that 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.750
 we must remember everything and we are from history 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.730
 must learn lessons 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.340
 because what's happening today on 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.010
 southeastern Ukraine is very similar to 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.080
 what we saw in the 21st century and now 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.380
 call this scary word genocide 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 therefore certainly the main thing is probably the result 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.190
 this forum 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.260
 remember this and draw conclusions bloody 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.330
 events happen in iraq and syria in 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.700
 live broadcast executions of people 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 thousands of refugees cry for help 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.370
 on pain of death, Christians leave 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.570
 the land on which they lived for thousands of years 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.240
 national tragedy alone 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.280
 people who are forgotten and it is massive 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.860
 refugees and hundreds of thousands of Osaris Christians 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.900
 escaped from the series from Iraq 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.800
 honest we are now half a million 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.400
 300 thousand 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.950
 in iraq reduced to 250 thousand people 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.550
 it's a tragedy it's not easy 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.830
 the destruction of the Christian people is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.630
 the beginning of the destruction of Christianity in general 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.760
 persecution of christians in the middle east 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.930
 discussed by representatives of the media 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.550
 information 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.290
 Some experts believe that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.120
 modern journalists too 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860
 selectively approaches this problem 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.580
 Christianity today is the most 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.739
 persecuted religion in the world and almost 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.590
 a Christian dies every minute in the world 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.420
 Western societies are much more much 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.970
 more interesting topics cause 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.440
 called democratic freedoms than 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.820
 real problem of christians 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.430
 one of those from relatives and giving hope 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.910
 examples it is oddly present 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.790
 Russian media that are at different angles 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.130
 all different reasons this topic is engaged 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.090
 dealt with the topic of not just war on 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.670
 middle east 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.360
 This theme sounds but themes 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.360
 persecution of christians
