00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.429
 show how to fix bugs 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 age of empires graphs of even the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.260
 at his walking on both of all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 way full of embers on 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.160
 orders are mostly age of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.470
 empires if ever your your pc too 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 recent for the game already have to say that the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 game is quite old so I specify 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.759
 it is for age of empires 2 that of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 1999 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 obviously for the 1 so basically the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 graphical bugs that gives that image to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.110
 right here it is it gives 5 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 graphic 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 once that suits and normally 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 it gives that so the original game at the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 base so I can not show you this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 what is tasiast cam that does not film 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.789
 the games so the thing you're going 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 do in fact if you are going to open a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.480
 notepad 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 here and there you will do you have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.629
 typed this code so wait for me you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 explains a little bit roughly the code it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.670
 means it will disable explore 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.320
 point x 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 so what is it all 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 we just do not know what it is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 but it's actually something that makes 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 it causes you graphic bugs 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.530
 he'll turn it off then he'll launch 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.729
 your game and that's it will be row it's 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 as simple as that so I 'll put the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.130
 code in the description 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 so after once the code it is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 do you call the name of the game so by 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.869
 example if these agents sign you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 go call h2 for example or so 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.540
 empire 2 as I do you in that you 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 go to file and save it 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 there you will take the repertoire of the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 game so there you have to install so 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.100
 hop it 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.110
 So here it is here you will do 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.610
 all the files 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.540
 so that's normally the full of 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.430
 files that will be displayed 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.140
 he has you will see I have mine so 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.740
 it works also with the extension because 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.630
 that must also be done to 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 the extension it's the same thing it's 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 exactly exactly the same then 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.890
 you do I do not know me the name 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.960
 that you want to beat points and then 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.940
 save you alas after ben voila 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.650
 you will have more than to launch the game so 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.930
 I'm going to cancel because I can 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.750
 do it anyway is not registered 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.230
 So here I do not know if it will film 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 hopefully we'll see when it's there 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.200
 normally it is that the users 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.320
 of windows 7 that should have this kind 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.650
 problem because normally it 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.190
 market 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.120
 in fact you lie about others so 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.220
 here I am the 2 g that of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.730
 the extension is that of the other so 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.570
 in the code 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.450
 you call to hang out I show you 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.280
 stone precisely see me I them 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.620
 called empire two points ex because 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.880
 it's a shame this file is actually 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.459
 the launcher 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.540
 we will make the wound of the same name and that 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.840
 will be the same for one or for 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.280
 the extension simply so listen 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.380
 I hope this tutorial will have you 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.830
 I'm more interested in doing 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.620
 videos 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.970
 so sorry if we do not have a lot in 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.560
 Anyway I hope it helped you 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.810
 and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 that's all and above all do not hesitate 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.970
 to write them subscribe to my channel a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 let him all
