00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.650 

it's<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> way<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.610> room<00:02:50.790> works<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.270> you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it's the way this room works is you

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's the way this room works is you
rotate<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.390> Lord's<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.540> throne

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
rotate one of the Lord's and the throne

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.140 
rotate one of the Lord's and the throne
and<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.380> open<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.010> associated<00:02:56.640> door<00:02:56.910> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and it will open the associated door and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.840 
and it will open the associated door and
within<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:57.990> trap<00:02:58.290> room<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.040> key<00:02:59.490> to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
within there is a trap room and a key to

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:12.200 
within there is a trap room and a key to
open<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> seal

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.360 

so<00:03:13.140> when<00:03:13.230> he's<00:03:13.320> one<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.560> these<00:03:13.620> rooms<00:03:13.890> there's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
so when he's one of these rooms there's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.340 
so when he's one of these rooms there's
a<00:03:14.880> key<00:03:15.360> protected<00:03:15.780> by<00:03:15.930> some<00:03:16.010> horrible<00:03:17.010> trap

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.840 

this<00:03:22.350> one<00:03:22.530> seems<00:03:22.830> simple<00:03:23.160> enough<00:03:23.190> he's<00:03:23.550> run

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
this one seems simple enough he's run

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.970 
this one seems simple enough he's run
past<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.360> these<00:03:24.510> blocks<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.080> all<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.830> these

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
past all these blocks but all of these

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.060 
past all these blocks but all of these
traps<00:03:26.310> are<00:03:26.660> designed<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.740> are

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
traps are designed so that they are

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.230 
traps are designed so that they are
easier<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.520> than<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.790> are<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.120> get

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
easier to get in than they are to get

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:45.420 
easier to get in than they are to get
out

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.240 

so<00:03:46.430> what<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.030> pull<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> block

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
so what you do is you pull the block

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.490 
so what you do is you pull the block
halfway<00:03:49.250> leave<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.150> there<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.050> then<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.290> run

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
halfway leave it there and then you run

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.110 
halfway leave it there and then you run
and<00:03:51.620> jump<00:03:51.800> on<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.160> get<00:03:52.400> protective<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.030> then

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
and jump on it get protective and then

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.900 
and jump on it get protective and then
run<00:03:53.330> out<00:03:53.920> that's<00:03:54.920> too<00:03:55.040> late<00:03:55.220> now<00:03:57.910> multiple

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
run out that's too late now multiple

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.250 
run out that's too late now multiple
ways<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.360> solve<00:03:59.540> puzzles

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.319
