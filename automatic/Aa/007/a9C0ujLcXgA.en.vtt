gone in to look out and the rock outline

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.230 
gone in to look out and the rock outline
is<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.210> down<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
is just down here and you can see that

this win the second spanner it's hurting
this<00:00:52.129> what's<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> pipe<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> remove<00:00:54.170> will

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
this what's this pipe is remove will

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.040 
this what's this pipe is remove will
then<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.309> hose<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.600> connect<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
then get the hose and you connect the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
then get the hose and you connect the
hose<00:00:58.260> onto<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.460> brass<00:01:00.979> push<00:01:01.979> it<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:03.080> then<00:01:04.080> suck

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
hose onto the brass push it on then suck

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.200 
hose onto the brass push it on then suck
the<00:01:04.890> oil

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.910 

now<00:01:10.510> before<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.840> start<00:01:10.960> sucking<00:01:11.380> obviously

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
now before you start sucking obviously

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.160 
now before you start sucking obviously
makes<00:01:12.160> your<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.550> loosen<00:01:13.240> with<00:01:13.720> this<00:01:13.870> valve

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
makes your the loosen with this valve

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.280 
makes your the loosen with this valve
here<00:01:14.290> turn<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.340> 90<00:01:16.000> degrees<00:01:16.030> pencil<00:01:16.930> clockwise

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
here turn it 90 degrees pencil clockwise

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.340 
here turn it 90 degrees pencil clockwise
son<00:01:17.800> using<00:01:18.220> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.800 

so<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:24.039> suck<00:01:24.310> through<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.969> pipe<00:01:25.179> just<00:01:25.479> gently

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
so you suck through the pipe just gently

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.260 
so you suck through the pipe just gently
until<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.710> hear<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.009> oil<00:01:27.219> just<00:01:27.909> starting

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
until you can hear the oil just starting

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.080 
until you can hear the oil just starting
to<00:01:28.299> come<00:01:28.539> into<00:01:28.719> the<00:01:28.960> into<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.439> hose<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.850> works

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
to come into the into the hose and works

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.459 
to come into the into the hose and works
you've<00:01:31.240> got<00:01:31.390> oil<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.780> hose<00:01:31.990> then<00:01:32.350> you

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
you've got oil in the hose then you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.039 
you've got oil in the hose then you
close<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.920> top<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.399> so<00:01:33.880> 90<00:01:34.329> degree<00:01:34.659> cut

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
close the top in it so 90 degree cut

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.350 
close the top in it so 90 degree cut

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
you can never move your hose you need to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.290 
you can never move your hose you need to
put<00:01:39.220> something<00:01:39.460> underneath<00:01:39.820> things<00:01:40.090> and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
put something underneath things and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.640 
put something underneath things and
perhaps<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.690> visitor

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
perhaps the visitor

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.610 
perhaps the visitor
but<00:01:43.650> once<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.490> tighten<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> hose<00:01:44.940> up

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
but once you tighten the hose up

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.770 
but once you tighten the hose up
you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.830> then<00:01:46.980> put<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.400> flexible<00:01:48.090> pipe<00:01:48.300> back

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you can then put this flexible pipe back

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.830 
you can then put this flexible pipe back
on<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> reverse<00:01:50.160> way

so once that's done you then open the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.430 
so once that's done you then open the
valve<00:01:56.030> back<00:01:56.240> up<00:01:56.420> again<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.290> this

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
valve back up again so that it's in this

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.170 
valve back up again so that it's in this
position<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.570> advancing<00:01:59.570> right<00:01:59.750> now<00:02:01.060> at<00:02:02.060> this

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
position and advancing right now at this

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.870 
position and advancing right now at this
point<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:03.770> will<00:02:03.950> need<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.190> take<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.400> cowling

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
point you will need to take the cowling

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550 
point you will need to take the cowling
off<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.180> there<00:02:05.330> are<00:02:05.450> nearly<00:02:05.630> two<00:02:05.960> screws<00:02:06.380> I've

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
off now there are nearly two screws I've

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.290 
off now there are nearly two screws I've
already<00:02:06.860> removed<00:02:07.010> them<00:02:07.400> there's<00:02:07.940> one<00:02:07.970> down

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
already removed them there's one down

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.270 
already removed them there's one down
here<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.869> there's<00:02:09.470> one<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.679> there

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
here and there's one in there

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.130 
here and there's one in there
once<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.090> points<00:02:11.360> those<00:02:11.510> two<00:02:11.720> screws<00:02:11.990> are

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
once the points those two screws are

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.050 
once the points those two screws are
removed<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.590> Cal<00:02:12.800> University<00:02:13.459> just<00:02:13.610> lit<00:02:13.880> up

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
removed the Cal University just lit up

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.310 
removed the Cal University just lit up
like<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:16.150> once<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> cowling<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.750> removed<00:02:18.110> you

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
like so once the cowling is removed you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.449 
like so once the cowling is removed you
will<00:02:18.500> see<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:19.160> behind<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.190> key

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
will see this behind it now the key

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.100 
will see this behind it now the key
things<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.150> need<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.330> become<00:02:23.750> sober

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
things that we need to become sober

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.650 
things that we need to become sober
there<00:02:24.850> are<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.660> lockout

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
there are this so this is the lockout

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.890 
there are this so this is the lockout
reset<00:02:30.110> button<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.850> one<00:02:32.060> here<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.840> is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
reset button and this one here this is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.690 
reset button and this one here this is
the<00:02:33.290> bleed<00:02:34.100> valve<00:02:34.370> air<00:02:34.640> be-bound<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.700> first

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the bleed valve air be-bound so first

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
the bleed valve air be-bound so first
thing<00:02:37.820> we<00:02:37.910> need<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.570> by<00:02:39.080> getting<00:02:39.350> a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
thing we need to do is by getting a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.590 
thing we need to do is by getting a
little<00:02:39.530> allen<00:02:39.920> key<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.850> inserting<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.480> in

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
little allen key and inserting it in

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.080 
little allen key and inserting it in
there<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:43.220> loosen<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.580> up<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.790> few

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there and we just loosen it up a few

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.050 
there and we just loosen it up a few
turns<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.830> what<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:46.489> happen<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.980> will

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
turns and what will happen is this will

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180 
turns and what will happen is this will
allow<00:02:50.060> when<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.750> pump<00:02:50.959> runs<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.560> air<00:02:51.769> will<00:02:52.040> be

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
allow when the pump runs the air will be

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.290 
allow when the pump runs the air will be
expelled<00:02:52.570> through<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:54.580> fluid<00:02:55.580> three<00:02:55.760> valve

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
expelled through this fluid three valve

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.090 
expelled through this fluid three valve
so<00:02:56.810> once<00:02:57.049> we've<00:02:57.200> loosened<00:02:57.350> this<00:02:57.620> off<00:02:57.799> a<00:02:57.890> couple

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
so once we've loosened this off a couple

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.699 
so once we've loosened this off a couple
of<00:02:58.160> turns<00:02:58.580> we<00:02:59.330> then<00:02:59.480> push<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.080> reset<00:03:00.380> button

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
of turns we then push the reset button

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.370 
of turns we then push the reset button
and<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:02.120> will<00:03:02.239> go<00:03:02.390> through<00:03:02.420> its<00:03:02.720> sequence<00:03:03.110> if

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
and it will go through its sequence if

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.240 
and it will go through its sequence if
the<00:03:04.010> fan<00:03:04.280> will<00:03:04.459> expel<00:03:04.910> up<00:03:05.480> through<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the fan will expel up through the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.810 
the fan will expel up through the
through<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.310> pipe<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:10.579> then<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
through the pipe here and and then it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.660 
through the pipe here and and then it
will<00:03:10.970> start<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.510> pump<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.140> run<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:13.519> will

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
will start the pump to run and what will

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.729 
will start the pump to run and what will
happen<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.030> at<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.630> point<00:03:14.870> it's<00:03:15.320> got<00:03:15.470> ideas

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
happen is at this point it's got ideas

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.949 
happen is at this point it's got ideas
put<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.160> underneath<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.480> catch<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.930> oil

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
put it underneath to to catch the oil

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.600 
put it underneath to to catch the oil
because<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> oil<00:03:18.590> will<00:03:18.739> drip<00:03:19.070> out<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.340> pair

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
because the oil will drip out a pair

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.940 
because the oil will drip out a pair
eventually<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> little<00:03:21.019> tray<00:03:21.470> or<00:03:21.620> something

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
eventually so a little tray or something

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.979 
eventually so a little tray or something
underneath<00:03:22.160> there<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.510> catch<00:03:23.690> anything

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
underneath there just to catch anything

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.560 
underneath there just to catch anything
coming<00:03:24.350> out<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.000> what<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.150> happen<00:03:26.209> when<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
coming out and what will happen when the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.660 
coming out and what will happen when the
pump<00:03:26.810> starts<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.260> run<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:27.980> will<00:03:28.220> bubble

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
pump starts to run this will bubble

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.759 
pump starts to run this will bubble
you'll<00:03:29.329> get<00:03:29.480> bubbles<00:03:29.870> coming<00:03:30.170> out<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.380> here

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
you'll get bubbles coming out of here

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.819 
you'll get bubbles coming out of here
and<00:03:30.950> eventually<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.549> should<00:03:32.239> get<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:33.350> little

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
and eventually you should get a little

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.310 
and eventually you should get a little
stream<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.370> oil<00:03:34.549> just<00:03:34.820> coming<00:03:35.420> out<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.540> here

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
stream of oil just coming out of here

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.490 
stream of oil just coming out of here
once<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.220> air<00:03:37.579> has<00:03:37.880> been<00:03:37.910> expelled<00:03:38.450> as<00:03:39.320> soon

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
once the air has been expelled as soon

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.170 
once the air has been expelled as soon
as<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.709> see<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> stream<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.370> oil<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.000> can

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
as you see the stream of oil you can

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.310 
as you see the stream of oil you can
tighten<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.630> back<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:42.019> again

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
tighten this back up again

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.819 
tighten this back up again
and<00:03:42.739> what's<00:03:43.549> that's<00:03:43.730> tight<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.410> boiler

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
and what's that's tight the boiler

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.640 
and what's that's tight the boiler
should<00:03:46.209> already<00:03:47.209> be<00:03:47.360> firing<00:03:47.720> up<00:03:48.019> actually

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
should already be firing up actually

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.770 
should already be firing up actually
during<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.040> process<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.390> doesn't<00:03:50.659> go

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
during that process if it doesn't go

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.350 
during that process if it doesn't go
straight<00:03:50.840> away<00:03:51.370> there<00:03:52.370> may<00:03:52.549> be<00:03:52.580> some<00:03:53.000> more<00:03:53.150> air

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
straight away there may be some more air

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.860 
straight away there may be some more air
in<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.599> system<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:55.510> wait<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.540> couple<00:03:56.720> of

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
in the system so wait a couple of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.320 
in the system so wait a couple of
minutes<00:03:56.959> push<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> reset<00:03:58.010> button<00:03:58.069> again<00:03:58.580> with

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
minutes push the reset button again with

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.140 
minutes push the reset button again with
the<00:03:59.450> valve<00:03:59.659> open<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:01.099> again<00:04:01.370> wait<00:04:01.640> until<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the valve open and again wait until the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.539 
the valve open and again wait until the
oil<00:04:02.180> starts<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:02.930> sort<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.290> stream<00:04:03.620> out<00:04:03.830> fairly

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
oil starts to sort of stream out fairly

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.390 
oil starts to sort of stream out fairly
rapidly<00:04:05.379> as<00:04:06.379> soon<00:04:06.620> as<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:06.799> see<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:06.950> rapid

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
rapidly as soon as you see that rapid

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.180 
rapidly as soon as you see that rapid
written<00:04:07.670> oil<00:04:07.879> try<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.659> often<00:04:08.989> up<00:04:09.140> here<00:04:09.440> between

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
written oil try it often up here between

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.819 
written oil try it often up here between
the<00:04:10.310> little<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.640> key<00:04:10.879> inside<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:14.230> then<00:04:15.230> press

but<00:04:18.169> as<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.410> can<00:04:18.560> see<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.100> boiler<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:20.090> now

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
but as you can see the boiler is now

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.920 
but as you can see the boiler is now
running<00:04:21.139> and<00:04:21.520> whirring<00:04:22.520> away<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
running and whirring away and the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.530 
running and whirring away and the
problem<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.260> solved
