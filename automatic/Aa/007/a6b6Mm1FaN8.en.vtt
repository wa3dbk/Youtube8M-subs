00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
beginning and so I didn't feel like I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.379 
beginning and so I didn't feel like I
was<00:03:04.739> completely<00:03:05.129> connecting<00:03:05.700> until<00:03:05.969> I<00:03:06.000> really

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.439 
and then when it did and it didn't even
feel<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.290> ended<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.400> nice<00:03:38.819> neat<00:03:39.150> way

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
feel like it ended in a nice neat way

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.390 
feel like it ended in a nice neat way
like<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.959> was<00:03:39.989> contrived<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:40.949> still<00:03:41.189> and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
like it was contrived and it's still and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.339 
like it was contrived and it's still and
it's<00:03:41.579> likely<00:03:41.790> messy<00:03:42.269> or<00:03:42.419> slightly<00:03:42.750> unresolved

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
it's likely messy or slightly unresolved

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.890 
it's likely messy or slightly unresolved
which<00:03:43.650> didn't<00:03:44.040> make<00:03:44.159> sense<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.489> me<00:03:44.609> because<00:03:45.209> if

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
which didn't make sense to me because if

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.170 
which didn't make sense to me because if
you're<00:03:46.049> going<00:03:46.259> to<00:03:46.769> create<00:03:47.129> an<00:03:47.609> ending<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you're going to create an ending that a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.819 
you're going to create an ending that a
slightly<00:03:48.479> contrived<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.500> should<00:03:49.709> at<00:03:49.799> least

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
slightly contrived you should at least

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.369 
slightly contrived you should at least
wrap<00:03:50.400> everything<00:03:50.849> up<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.479> don't<00:03:51.870> know<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.349> just

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
wrap everything up I don't know it just

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.979 
wrap everything up I don't know it just
didn't<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.609> work<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:54.000> me<00:03:54.389> but<00:03:54.750> otherwise

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
didn't really work for me but otherwise

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.809 
didn't really work for me but otherwise
I<00:03:55.259> didn't<00:03:55.530> really<00:03:56.129> really<00:03:56.400> enjoy<00:03:56.639> this<00:03:56.759> book

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
I didn't really really enjoy this book

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.089 
I didn't really really enjoy this book
this<00:03:57.120> book<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.449> really<00:03:57.629> fast<00:03:57.930> read<00:03:58.199> and<00:03:58.560> when

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
this book is a really fast read and when

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.619 
this book is a really fast read and when
I<00:03:59.129> was<00:03:59.430> reading<00:03:59.759> the<00:03:59.849> book<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> didn't<00:04:00.419> want<00:04:00.540> to

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
I was reading the book I didn't want to

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.210 
I was reading the book I didn't want to
stop<00:04:00.810> reading<00:04:01.019> there<00:04:01.409> were<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.889> couple<00:04:02.009> of

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
stop reading there were a couple of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.530 
stop reading there were a couple of
times<00:04:02.400> where<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.639> was<00:04:02.819> reading<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.239> during<00:04:03.449> my

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
times where I was reading this during my

lunch break and I wish my lunch break

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.530 
lunch break and I wish my lunch break
was<00:04:05.370> longer<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:06.060> way<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.180> could<00:04:06.299> keep

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
was longer so that way I could keep

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.030 
was longer so that way I could keep
going<00:04:06.599> because<00:04:07.079> once<00:04:07.409> you're<00:04:07.530> in<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.799> world

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
super satisfied with the ending so I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.820 
super satisfied with the ending so I
didn't<00:04:30.360> feel<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:30.660> giving<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> four<00:04:31.320> star<00:04:31.560> by

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
