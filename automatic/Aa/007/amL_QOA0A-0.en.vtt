the<00:01:20.549> reason<00:01:21.450> why<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.840> gloves<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the reason why I think gloves is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
the reason why I think gloves is
required<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.460> stick<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.880> hands

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
required it could stick your hands

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.350 
required it could stick your hands
probably<00:01:25.470> extremely<00:01:26.100> difficult<00:01:26.880> or

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
probably extremely difficult or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350 
probably extremely difficult or
impossible<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:28.020> wash<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.090> gives

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
impossible to wash out and so that gives

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
impossible to wash out and so that gives
a<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.840> cold<00:01:31.909> Zink<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.860> before

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
a very cold Zink look to it before

buffing<00:01:35.900> lightly<00:01:36.900> buffing<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.700> brings<00:01:38.700> out

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
buffing lightly buffing it brings out

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.820
