so like I said or not sure if I said
this<00:01:52.560> before<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.070> why<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.610> ap<00:01:53.850> Jax<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.329> q

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this before but why go ap Jax your q

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
this before but why go ap Jax your q
your<00:01:55.020> w<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.219> e<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.939> ultimate

combination you can do with a lich bane
and<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.549> why<00:02:02.670> i<00:02:02.700> recommend<00:02:02.909> rushing<00:02:03.509> a
