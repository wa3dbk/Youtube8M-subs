hey<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.170> Mike<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.800> if<00:00:02.070> your<00:00:02.280> computer

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey this is Mike here if your computer

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey this is Mike here if your computer
is<00:00:02.730> freezing<00:00:03.449> constantly<00:00:04.170> then<00:00:04.799> I'm<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
is freezing constantly then I'm going to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.619 
is freezing constantly then I'm going to
go<00:00:05.279> through<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> few<00:00:05.790> things<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.299> help<00:00:06.330> you

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
go through a few things to help you

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.500 
go through a few things to help you
identify<00:00:06.750> what<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.649> could<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.510> generally

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
identify what it could be and generally

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.839 
identify what it could be and generally
it<00:00:09.809> if<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.410> if<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:10.920> freezing<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.400> lot<00:00:11.610> it's

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
it if it's if it's freezing a lot it's

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.509 
it if it's if it's freezing a lot it's
usually<00:00:12.059> an<00:00:12.330> overload<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.809> RAM<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:14.219> may<00:00:14.340> have

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
usually an overload in RAM you may have

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.039 
usually an overload in RAM you may have
an<00:00:14.639> older<00:00:14.910> computer<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.630> doesn't<00:00:15.900> have

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
an older computer and it doesn't have

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
an older computer and it doesn't have
enough<00:00:16.080> RAM<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.300> you've<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.480> multiple

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
enough RAM so that you've got multiple

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.929 
enough RAM so that you've got multiple
applications<00:00:19.500> open<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> same<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
applications open at the same time you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.400 
applications open at the same time you
might<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.330> application<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.080> uses<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
might have an application that uses a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
might have an application that uses a
lot<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> memory<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.539> cause<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
lot of memory and that will cause your

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.939 
lot of memory and that will cause your
machine<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> freeze<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.210> could<00:00:27.420> also<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.949> CPU

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
machine to freeze it could also be CPU

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.669 
machine to freeze it could also be CPU
you're<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.550> CPU<00:00:29.970> isn't<00:00:30.529> fast<00:00:31.529> enough

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you're not so your CPU isn't fast enough

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
you're not so your CPU isn't fast enough
to<00:00:31.980> handle<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.460> you're<00:00:32.610> doing<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:34.079> few

you've got something in there you're not
sure<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.890> these<00:01:56.520> memory

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
sure of what it is and these memory

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.319 
sure of what it is and these memory
memory<00:01:57.540> usage<00:01:58.110> field<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.189> high<00:01:59.430> then

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
memory usage field is really high then

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.120 
memory usage field is really high then
that<00:02:00.360> could<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.899> something<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.439> look<00:02:01.799> into

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that could be something to look into

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
that could be something to look into
that<00:02:02.579> particular<00:02:03.060> application<00:02:03.450> could<00:02:04.110> be

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that particular application could be

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
that particular application could be
causing<00:02:04.619> your<00:02:04.710> computer<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> freeze<00:02:06.079> aside

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
causing your computer to freeze aside

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.360 
causing your computer to freeze aside
from<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:08.929> another<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.800> use<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
from that another thing I do is use a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
from that another thing I do is use a
program<00:02:11.790> called<00:02:11.819> regcure<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
program called regcure and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.699 
program called regcure and
this<00:02:13.950> Cancer<00:02:14.430> Registry<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.329> deletes<00:02:15.840> invalid

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
this Cancer Registry and deletes invalid

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.309 
this Cancer Registry and deletes invalid
entries<00:02:17.189> basically<00:02:18.150> cleans<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.719> your<00:02:18.749> system

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
entries basically cleans out your system

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.619 
entries basically cleans out your system
another<00:02:20.010> thing<00:02:20.249> I<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.579> with<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.480> got

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
another thing I like with it is it's got

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.050 
another thing I like with it is it's got
this<00:02:21.780> manage<00:02:22.200> startup<00:02:22.469> tab<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.819> shows

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this manage startup tab so this shows

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.530 
this manage startup tab so this shows
you<00:02:24.209> everything<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.629> ms<00:02:25.049> config<00:02:25.650> showed<00:02:26.579> but

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you everything that ms config showed but

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
you everything that ms config showed but
you<00:02:28.439> can<00:02:28.620> actually<00:02:29.040> remove<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.519> from<00:02:29.639> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you can actually remove it from the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.449 
you can actually remove it from the
registry<00:02:30.299> using<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.810> software<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
registry using this software and the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.250 
registry using this software and the
only<00:02:32.609> way<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.879> do<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.269> manually<00:02:33.719> is<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.109> go

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
only way to do that manually is to go

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.589 
only way to do that manually is to go
into<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> registry<00:02:35.129> editor<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.700> Windows<00:02:36.329> and

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
into the registry editor in Windows and

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.179 
into the registry editor in Windows and
if<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.930> start<00:02:37.139> deleting<00:02:37.469> things<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
if you start deleting things out of

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.250 
if you start deleting things out of
there<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.639> you're<00:02:38.879> not<00:02:39.049> 100%<00:02:40.049> sure<00:02:40.109> what

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260

there and you're not 100% sure what
you're<00:02:40.560> doing<00:02:40.829> then<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.879> could<00:02:42.090> delete

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
you're doing then you could delete

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.989 
you're doing then you could delete
something<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.169> will<00:02:43.489> completely<00:02:44.489> staff

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:44.999 
something that will completely staff

something that will completely staff
your<00:02:45.180> machine<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.629> might<00:02:45.689> be<00:02:45.840> able<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.079> start
