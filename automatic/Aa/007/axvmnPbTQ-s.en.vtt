00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:41.500 

to<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.310> other<00:00:29.430> glove<00:00:29.670> on

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.330 

roommates<00:00:42.230> keep<00:00:42.470> moving<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:42.890> chairs<00:00:43.160> and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
roommates keep moving the chairs and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.440 
roommates keep moving the chairs and
stuff<00:00:43.520> around<00:00:43.760> back<00:00:44.030> here<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:44.330> really

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
stuff around back here it's really

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.330 
stuff around back here it's really
annoying<00:00:47.770> because<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:48.950> have<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.130> turn<00:00:49.280> around

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
annoying because I have to turn around

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:06.980 
annoying because I have to turn around
over<00:00:49.730> here

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.880 

so<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.930> throttle<00:01:09.930> response<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.440> everything

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so the throttle response and everything

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
so the throttle response and everything
feels<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:11.970> snappier<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> good

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
feels a little bit snappier in a good

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.460 
feels a little bit snappier in a good
way<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.970> feels<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.300> little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.570> faster<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
way it feels a little bit faster it's a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.429 
way it feels a little bit faster it's a
lot<00:01:16.650> louder

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.230 

and<00:01:20.799> yeah<00:01:21.100> that's<00:01:21.310> really<00:01:21.609> about<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.210> looks

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
and yeah that's really about it it looks

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.569 
and yeah that's really about it it looks
a<00:01:22.600> lot<00:01:22.780> cooler<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.469> side<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.249> is<00:01:24.399> made

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
a lot cooler to the side of it is made

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.529 
a lot cooler to the side of it is made
out<00:01:24.789> of

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
out of

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:26.910 
out of
well<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:25.840> slip<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.170> part<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.530> made<00:01:26.710> out<00:01:26.799> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
well the slip on part is made out of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.069 
well the slip on part is made out of
carbon<00:01:27.130> fiber<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.600> rest<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:28.929> its

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
carbon fiber and then the rest of its

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.120 
carbon fiber and then the rest of its
titanium<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:30.039> it's<00:01:30.219> like<00:01:30.399> 10<00:01:30.579> pounds<00:01:30.969> lighter

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
titanium so it's like 10 pounds lighter

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.889 
titanium so it's like 10 pounds lighter
than<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.250> used<00:01:33.459> to<00:01:33.579> be<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:37.329> in<00:01:37.539> all<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.719> would

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080 
get the rev limiter but I wanted to hear
what<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.349> sounded<00:02:17.739> like<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.939> new

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
about three hours into this because

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.550 
about three hours into this because
again<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:12.509> had<00:06:12.749> no<00:06:12.900> idea<00:06:13.020> what<00:06:13.229> I<00:06:13.259> was<00:06:13.379> doing

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
instructions were actually really good

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.910 
instructions were actually really good
but<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.690> pictures<00:06:20.020> were<00:06:20.200> kind<00:06:20.410> of<00:06:20.500> zoomed<00:06:20.710> in

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
but the pictures were kind of zoomed in

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.550 
but the pictures were kind of zoomed in
and<00:06:21.040> grainy<00:06:21.310> black<00:06:21.760> and<00:06:21.790> white<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.560> looking

for<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.830> right<00:06:23.980> connectors<00:06:24.490> was<00:06:24.990> tricky<00:06:25.990> if<00:06:26.380> I

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
for the right connectors was tricky if I

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.320 
for the right connectors was tricky if I
didn't<00:06:26.950> know<00:06:27.040> what<00:06:27.160> I<00:06:27.250> was<00:06:27.370> looking<00:06:27.700> for<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:28.180> I

um<00:06:32.490> including<00:06:33.490> removing<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.150> fuel<00:06:34.360> tank<00:06:34.810> and

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
um including removing the fuel tank and

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.150 
um including removing the fuel tank and
much<00:06:35.680> other<00:06:35.920> stuff<00:06:36.300> but<00:06:37.440> it<00:06:38.440> was<00:06:38.590> worth<00:06:38.800> it<00:06:39.010> I

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
much other stuff but it was worth it I

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.830 
much other stuff but it was worth it I
enjoy<00:06:39.700> that<00:06:39.970> kind<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.150> stuff<00:06:40.390> anyways<00:06:40.810> even

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
enjoy that kind of stuff anyways even

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.670 
enjoy that kind of stuff anyways even
though<00:06:41.260> it<00:06:41.320> was<00:06:41.440> kind<00:06:41.590> of<00:06:41.740> like<00:06:43.590> confusing<00:06:44.590> I

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
though it was kind of like confusing I

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.020 
though it was kind of like confusing I
guess<00:06:44.860> at<00:06:45.040> first<00:06:46.140> so<00:06:47.140> I<00:06:47.200> would<00:06:47.320> do<00:06:47.410> it<00:06:47.500> again

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
guess at first so I would do it again

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.909 
guess at first so I would do it again
I'd<00:06:49.030> definitely<00:06:49.240> do<00:06:49.540> it<00:06:49.570> again<00:06:49.720> if<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:50.800> ever

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
I'd definitely do it again if I ever

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.240 
I'd definitely do it again if I ever

and<00:07:03.660> I<00:07:03.720> know<00:07:03.780> you<00:07:03.960> can<00:07:04.050> get<00:07:04.140> mirrors<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.710> have

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
and I know you can get mirrors that have

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.720 
and I know you can get mirrors that have
LEDs<00:07:05.280> on<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:05.520> front<00:07:06.020> facing<00:07:07.020> side<00:07:07.550> so<00:07:08.550> that

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
LEDs on the front facing side so that

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.030 
LEDs on the front facing side so that
people<00:07:08.940> can<00:07:09.120> see<00:07:09.300> them<00:07:09.330> and<00:07:10.050> that<00:07:10.770> would<00:07:10.950> be

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
people can see them and that would be

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.410 
people can see them and that would be
pretty<00:07:11.190> cool<00:07:11.460> thinking<00:07:12.180> about<00:07:12.360> that<00:07:13.610> and<00:07:14.610> if<00:07:15.300> I

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
pretty cool thinking about that and if I

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.520 
pretty cool thinking about that and if I
don't<00:07:15.480> do<00:07:15.720> that<00:07:15.870> I<00:07:15.900> always<00:07:16.080> get<00:07:16.290> little

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
don't do that I always get little

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.250 
don't do that I always get little
