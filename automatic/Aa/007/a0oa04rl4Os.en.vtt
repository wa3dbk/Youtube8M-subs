00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 greetings to all hdblog readers from 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.310
 damen j 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 we are again in ipad company 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.719
 third generation to try a new one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.330
 title we talk about need for speed most 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.820
 wanted to electronic art 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.789
 a title that brings graphic quality 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.830
 in the mobile tablet field in this case a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 a decidedly higher level of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:29.490
 what has been seen so far this quality 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.780
 graphics, however, do not have the same 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.399
 acknowledgment in the quality of the game itself 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 let us then start in the making 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.489
 showing to show you a brief 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 excerpt of the game and a version 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.230
 beautiful graphically but limited in 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.090
 content limited in content in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.059
 how much a real one is not present 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.930
 multiplayer like the console version e 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.650
 the use of the app purchase 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.450
 and really felt unless we did 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.430
 wants to try again try to make the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.380
 same races to earn from without 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.740
 credits to buy more machines 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.960
 powerful will be very limited 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.570
 the playability in this from this point 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.900
 of view but the title is really well 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.490
 made and currently sold 5 euros and 49 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.110
 in the app store 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.740
 let's take a look at the menus 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.300
 before embarking on a short race 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.430
 this will be the main destination where 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.130
 we will find all the events unlocked 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.470
 new tenders the possibility to choose a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 depending on what we want to try 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.320
 all available events by winning 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.570
 and we'll unlock more in our garage 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.950
 we can see the car our 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.410
 possession then we can unlock them where 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.270
 we will be able to evaluate whether to change the color or 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.399
 take a closer look at the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.280
 our medium as you see the definition 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.340
 the quality is really exceptional both up 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.119
 ipad that on iphone 5 support a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.440
 high resolution retina display yes 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.630
 sees and brings graphic quality indeed 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.850
 close to that of the consoles 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.799
 then we will see him better in the race what they are 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.769
 information about our career 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.640
 the rankings the possibility of 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.670
 connect to origin then compare i 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 results with those of our friends and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.799
 then ok the settings where we can 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.019
 choose the controls and the classic ones 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.410
 sensitivity settings e 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.820
 whatever else we go back to the map e 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.680
 let's try to face a race too 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.810
 regarding the upgrades 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.220
 we were a little disappointed there are not 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.459
 real enhancements of the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.470
 half but pre- race we could 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.230
 decide to spend the credits to get 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.950
 enhancements only valid for that one 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.620
 event will give us a hand 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 greater ease in victory but there 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.560
 they will make the credits decrease when spent 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.110
 as we will see going forward in the game 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 will be fundamental to buy 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.690
 other means 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.700
 we find ourselves facing a race that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 mclaren mp4 12 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.690
 as you can see there are slots that we 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.660
 we can use to have gods 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.099
 upgrades in this case we could 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.530
 have a more efficient charge 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.880
 or a power package for example 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 but we use these 24 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.260
 as you can see it will cost 15 thousand 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.129
 credits that will be felt on 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.500
 general budget 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.590
 let's try to face the race this is 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.330
 a time race to use the nose we'll see 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.239
 we will use a swipe gesture towards 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.299
 up on the right side for propped up 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.250
 greased just press the screen 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.240
 on the ato end 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.110
 as you can see the quality really is 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.110
 awesome 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.840
 the hand of the nas once launched 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.840
 will download and recharge depending on 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.880
 in the fact that you don't have more or less a 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.880
 upgrade or the car is original 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.880
 no 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.789
 ari 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.730
 the police will do anything to stop us 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.430
 try to give us the career gomez the 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.900
 street trying to waste our time 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.940
 its fundamental leader who knows that yes 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.940
 this is a first race 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.340
 how to get rid of a vehicle 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.789
 police this will recharge ours 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.789
 our 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.160
 in this case we failed the race 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.160
 we find another one 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.960
 it's not that to try another medium in 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.470
 In this case we will not use any 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.470
 strengthening 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.160
 and with the boys it's really great 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.599
 real-time reflections throughout 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.220
 another definition really a pleasure 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.520
 doesn't really seem to be playing on an ipad 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.800
 not that we haven't seen high games 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.480
 quality but this is really really well 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.470
 done 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.470
 the output understand the potential 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.740
 the latest generation in the field 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.430
 the soundtrack by 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.930
 nepotism layers with important pieces ad 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.660
 example of chemical brothers but in 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.930
 this case we turned around we see 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.930
 but people 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.230
 as you can see the realization 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.020
 of the installments but I repeat if it were not for 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.940
 some defects that have taken ours 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.920
 opinion in the sense they wanted to create one 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.480
 a little online version of the game for 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.330
 to spur the aggression purchase 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.160
 console but apart from that in the title is 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.550
 beautiful to see to play too 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.930
 very funny but a bit disappointed it 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.820
 defendants 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.340
 having said that it remains a real title 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.460
 gratifying to be played on tablets 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.500
 in this case certainly on ipad 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.460
 more than on iphone for size 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.890
 of the screen and I would say that all need for 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.610
 speed most wanted therefore purchasable from 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.980
 app store 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.830
 always at a graphic level another gem 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.020
 is that of damage to vehicles on time 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.740
 actually we will have to stay a lot 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:36.030
 careful not to destroy ours 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.320
 half as each collision collision 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.100
 will create actual damage to the bodywork 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.100
 that in any case will not have repercussions a 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.160
 performance level on our vehicle 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.050
 for the review everything is a greeting from 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.190
 adam hahn j paracalli blog and see you 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.700
 on our site 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.700
 Hi everyone 

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.249
 well
