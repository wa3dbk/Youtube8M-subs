00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
that's on the table tennis we're a much

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.330 
that's on the table tennis we're a much
of<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.269> lost<00:04:14.540> over<00:04:14.900> here<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.440> HTC<00:04:15.830> one

so I could see much better details and I
can<00:04:19.220> see<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> real<00:04:19.609> difference<00:04:20.000> between

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
can see the real difference between

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.600 
can see the real difference between
having<00:04:20.720> 13<00:04:21.169> pixels<00:04:21.710> as

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610

in<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.460> particular<00:04:29.090> photo<00:04:30.849> etc<00:04:31.849> now<00:04:32.210> these

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:32.719 
in this particular photo etc now these

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.809 
in this particular photo etc now these
two<00:04:32.960> photos<00:04:33.319> are<00:04:33.469> both<00:04:33.590> good<00:04:33.800> photos<00:04:34.219> I<00:04:34.460> tend

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
two photos are both good photos I tend

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.170 
two photos are both good photos I tend
to<00:04:34.849> like<00:04:34.969> the<00:04:35.150> HTC<00:04:35.599> one<00:04:35.810> better<00:04:36.219> and<00:04:37.219> I<00:04:38.150> just

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
to like the HTC one better and I just

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.909 
to like the HTC one better and I just
like<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.509> way<00:04:38.629> the<00:04:38.840> colors<00:04:39.169> mount<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
like the way the colors mount and the

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.100 
like the way the colors mount and the
details<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.550> everything<00:04:40.610> else<00:04:41.060> these<00:04:41.960> are

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
details and everything else these are

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.490 
details and everything else these are
probably<00:04:42.409> taken<00:04:42.710> at<00:04:42.800> different<00:04:43.090> heights<00:04:44.090> so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
probably taken at different heights so

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.350 
probably taken at different heights so
give<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.530> into<00:04:46.340> your<00:04:46.580> thought<00:04:46.789> process<00:04:47.180> when

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
give that into your thought process when

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.450 
give that into your thought process when
you<00:04:47.419> realize<00:04:47.719> that<00:04:47.750> I've<00:04:48.289> made<00:04:48.560> up<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:49.069> exactly

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
you realize that I've made up in exactly

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.920 
you realize that I've made up in exactly
at<00:04:49.819> the<00:04:49.909> same<00:04:50.120> height<00:04:50.360> when<00:04:50.569> took<00:04:50.810> these

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
at the same height when took these

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.830 
at the same height when took these
photos<00:04:51.229> so<00:04:51.379> the<00:04:52.300> relationship<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.449> them<00:04:53.599> is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
photos so the relationship to them is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.379 
photos so the relationship to them is
very<00:04:53.870> different<00:04:54.969> one<00:04:55.969> thing<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.270> is

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
very different one thing that is

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.570 
very different one thing that is
interesting<00:04:56.629> and<00:04:57.289> this<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:58.069> something<00:04:58.400> that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
interesting and this is something that

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.450 
interesting and this is something that
haven't<00:04:59.389> been<00:04:59.449> excited<00:04:59.990> with<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.349> HTC<00:05:01.250> one

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.080 
haven't been excited with the HTC one
and<00:05:01.759> it's<00:05:02.029> a<00:05:02.090> very<00:05:02.270> honest<00:05:02.689> fail<00:05:03.009> is<00:05:04.090> this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
and it's a very honest fail is this

the<00:05:43.580> HTC<00:05:43.879> One<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.599> for<00:05:44.960> me<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.080> real<00:05:45.349> big

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
the HTC One and for me a real big

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.469 
the HTC One and for me a real big
difference<00:05:45.650> maker<00:05:46.069> here<00:05:46.819> once<00:05:47.000> again<00:05:47.089> is<00:05:47.449> a

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
difference maker here once again is a

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.119 
difference maker here once again is a
video<00:05:47.960> shot<00:05:48.319> where<00:05:48.589> we're<00:05:48.740> shooting<00:05:49.009> in

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
video shot where we're shooting in

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.399 
video shot where we're shooting in
complete<00:05:49.490> darkness<00:05:49.819> and<00:05:50.150> we<00:05:50.810> had<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:51.050> focus

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
complete darkness and we had to focus

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.409 
complete darkness and we had to focus
both<00:05:51.650> these<00:05:51.889> cameras<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.789> be<00:05:52.939> able<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.120> find

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
both these cameras in to be able to find

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.529 
both these cameras in to be able to find
their<00:05:53.569> focus<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.469> can<00:05:54.650> see<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.039> s4<00:05:55.759> is<00:05:56.150> doing

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
their focus you can see the s4 is doing

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:57.040 
their focus you can see the s4 is doing
just<00:05:56.750> fine

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
just fine

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.760 
just fine
and<00:05:57.349> has<00:05:58.039> a<00:05:58.069> huge<00:05:58.699> bright<00:05:59.180> lamp<00:05:59.779> flash<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.650> it

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
and has a huge bright lamp flash to it

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.100 
and has a huge bright lamp flash to it
where<00:06:01.310> as<00:06:01.430> opposed<00:06:02.050> on<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.490> HTC<00:06:04.490> One<00:06:05.110> really

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
where as opposed on the HTC One really

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.959 
where as opposed on the HTC One really
struggling<00:06:06.439> to<00:06:06.650> find<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.949> focus<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.610> keep

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969

struggling to find the focus and keep
the<00:06:08.120> focus<00:06:08.539> and<00:06:08.870> also<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.909> lamp<00:06:11.180> flash<00:06:11.870> isn't

the focus and also the lamp flash isn't

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.219 
the focus and also the lamp flash isn't
that<00:06:12.560> bright<00:06:13.009> on<00:06:13.339> the<00:06:13.759> HTC<00:06:14.180> one<00:06:14.509> so<00:06:14.990> huge

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
that bright on the HTC one so huge

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.300 
that bright on the HTC one so huge
difference<00:06:15.589> here<00:06:15.710> in<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:15.889> quality

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
difference here in the quality

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.309 
difference here in the quality
especially<00:06:16.789> if<00:06:16.909> you're<00:06:17.060> operating<00:06:17.900> in

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
especially if you're operating in

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.469 
especially if you're operating in
completely<00:06:19.039> dark<00:06:19.279> situations<00:06:19.969> you're<00:06:20.180> taking

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
completely dark situations you're taking

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.540 
completely dark situations you're taking
Nightclub<00:06:20.930> shots<00:06:21.229> you're<00:06:21.620> out<00:06:21.740> at<00:06:21.889> night<00:06:21.949> etc

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
Nightclub shots you're out at night etc

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.309 
Nightclub shots you're out at night etc
etc<00:06:22.610> maybe<00:06:23.449> that<00:06:23.659> it's<00:06:23.750> not<00:06:23.900> important<00:06:24.259> to

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
etc maybe that it's not important to

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.659 
etc maybe that it's not important to
most<00:06:24.439> people<00:06:24.770> because<00:06:24.919> they<00:06:25.099> won't<00:06:25.219> take

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
most people because they won't take

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.209 
most people because they won't take
these<00:06:25.879> style<00:06:26.629> of<00:06:26.750> shots<00:06:27.020> but<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.949> can

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
these style of shots but it can

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.740 
these style of shots but it can
definitely<00:06:28.639> make<00:06:28.759> a<00:06:28.819> difference<00:06:28.939> in<00:06:29.509> the

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
definitely make a difference in the

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.659 
definitely make a difference in the
quality<00:06:29.870> of<00:06:30.080> your<00:06:30.169> photos<00:06:30.560> overall<00:06:31.069> over<00:06:31.490> time

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
quality of your photos overall over time

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.209 
quality of your photos overall over time
so<00:06:32.180> all<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:32.449> choose<00:06:32.779> and<00:06:33.139> decide<00:06:33.469> which<00:06:34.009> one

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
so all you choose and decide which one

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.910 
so all you choose and decide which one
might<00:06:34.370> work<00:06:34.520> best

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
might work best

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.550 
might work best
for<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.400> they<00:06:35.730> are<00:06:35.910> both<00:06:36.120> 1080p<00:06:36.930> 30<00:06:37.290> frames

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
for you they are both 1080p 30 frames

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.250 
for you they are both 1080p 30 frames
per<00:06:37.770> second<00:06:38.220> video<00:06:38.670> recorders<00:06:39.510> but<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.140> is

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
per second video recorders but it is

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.590 
per second video recorders but it is
interesting<00:06:40.860> that<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:41.340> lamp<00:06:41.550> flash<00:06:41.850> is<00:06:42.210> a

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
interesting that the lamp flash is a

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.870 
interesting that the lamp flash is a
thing<00:06:43.290> that<00:06:43.320> you<00:06:43.500> have<00:06:43.590> to<00:06:43.680> consider<00:06:44.040> when<00:06:44.550> you

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
thing that you have to consider when you

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.290 
thing that you have to consider when you
are<00:06:44.910> buying<00:06:45.570> these<00:06:46.250> cameras<00:06:47.250> and<00:06:47.490> looking<00:06:48.210> at

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
are buying these cameras and looking at

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.850 
are buying these cameras and looking at
them<00:06:48.450> from<00:06:48.570> that<00:06:48.780> aspect<00:06:49.110> that's<00:06:49.650> we're

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
them from that aspect that's we're

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.020 
them from that aspect that's we're
taking<00:06:50.610> 21<00:06:50.970> down<00:06:51.290> overall<00:06:52.290> I<00:06:52.560> think<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:53.040> s4<00:06:53.850> is

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
taking 21 down overall I think the s4 is

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.000 
taking 21 down overall I think the s4 is
better<00:06:54.300> well<00:06:54.900> there<00:06:55.350> are<00:06:55.440> certain<00:06:55.710> pictures

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
better well there are certain pictures

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.680 
better well there are certain pictures
that<00:06:56.220> I<00:06:56.280> will<00:06:56.490> like<00:06:56.730> especially<00:06:57.240> in<00:06:57.330> low<00:06:57.450> light

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
that I will like especially in low light

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.830 
that I will like especially in low light
from<00:06:57.960> the<00:06:58.080> HTC<00:06:58.650> One<00:06:59.120> overall<00:07:00.120> when<00:07:00.570> it<00:07:00.690> comes

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
from the HTC One overall when it comes

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.230 
from the HTC One overall when it comes
to<00:07:01.020> video<00:07:01.260> and<00:07:01.440> lamp<00:07:01.650> flash<00:07:01.980> I<00:07:02.250> like<00:07:02.700> the<00:07:02.850> s4

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
to video and lamp flash I like the s4

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.060 
to video and lamp flash I like the s4
much<00:07:03.450> better<00:07:03.720> especially<00:07:03.900> from<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.500> menu<00:07:04.830> and

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
much better especially from the menu and

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.660 
much better especially from the menu and
the<00:07:05.550> ease<00:07:05.790> of<00:07:05.820> it<00:07:06.060> and<00:07:06.300> everything<00:07:06.660> else<00:07:07.610> ok<00:07:08.610> so

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
the ease of it and everything else ok so

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.430 
the ease of it and everything else ok so
