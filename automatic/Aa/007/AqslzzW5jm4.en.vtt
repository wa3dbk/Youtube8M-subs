fluorocarbon tied onto your braid is not

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.520 
fluorocarbon tied onto your braid is not
enough<00:00:44.200> you<00:00:45.190> will<00:00:45.670> catch<00:00:45.880> more<00:00:46.120> fish<00:00:46.360> on<00:00:46.630> a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
enough you will catch more fish on a

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.760 
enough you will catch more fish on a
fluorocarbon<00:00:48.489> main<00:00:49.390> line<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.200> when<00:00:50.470> I<00:00:50.500> say

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
fluorocarbon main line and when I say

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.300 
fluorocarbon main line and when I say
mainline<00:00:51.310> that's<00:00:51.640> all<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.000> way<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.149> your<00:00:52.540> real

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
mainline that's all the way to your real

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.540 
mainline that's all the way to your real
because<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.460> fish<00:00:54.670> cannot<00:00:55.059> see<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
because the fish cannot see it the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.220 
because the fish cannot see it the
fluorocarbons<00:00:58.290> are<00:00:59.290> very<00:00:59.829> low<00:01:00.250> stretch<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
fluorocarbons are very low stretch and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.760 
fluorocarbons are very low stretch and
they're<00:01:02.440> very<00:01:02.469> abrasive<00:01:03.360> resistant<00:01:04.770> they're

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
they're very abrasive resistant they're

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.130 
they're very abrasive resistant they're
also<00:01:05.890> very<00:01:06.070> sensitive<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.630> can<00:01:07.780> feel

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
also very sensitive so you can feel

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.280 
also very sensitive so you can feel
everything<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.670> transmitted<00:01:10.420> through

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
everything that is transmitted through

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.880 
everything that is transmitted through
the<00:01:11.740> fluorocarbon<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:13.570> also<00:01:13.870> thinks<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.590> lot

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
the fluorocarbon it also thinks a lot

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.950 
the fluorocarbon it also thinks a lot
heavier<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:16.420> quicker<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.830> mono<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:19.090> also<00:01:19.360> an

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
heavier or quicker and mono it's also an

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.530 
heavier or quicker and mono it's also an
braid<00:01:20.409> with<00:01:21.100> braids<00:01:21.600> floats<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:25.299> keeps

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
braid with braids floats so it keeps

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.930 
braid with braids floats so it keeps
your<00:01:25.780> lures<00:01:26.200> down<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> strike<00:01:27.400> zone<00:01:27.460> which

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
your lures down in the strike zone which

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.530 
your lures down in the strike zone which
is<00:01:27.970> very<00:01:28.390> important<00:01:29.080> so<00:01:29.740> for<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.340> reason<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
is very important so for this reason you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.710 
is very important so for this reason you
can<00:01:31.690> even<00:01:31.810> downsize<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:32.890> if<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.250> use<00:01:33.970> 20-pound

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
can even downsize so if you use 20-pound

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.890 
can even downsize so if you use 20-pound
in<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.439> monk<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.799> Timbers<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:37.240> spinner

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
in the monk the Timbers with spinner

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.219 
in the monk the Timbers with spinner
baits<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:39.070> can<00:01:39.280> actually<00:01:40.650> downsize<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:42.130> say<00:01:42.760> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
baits you can actually downsize to say a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
baits you can actually downsize to say a
14-12<00:01:44.229> or<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:47.080> know<00:01:47.229> 16<00:01:47.799> at<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.280> heaviest

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
14-12 or you know 16 at the heaviest

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.940 
14-12 or you know 16 at the heaviest
because<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.710> fluorocarbon<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:52.570> take<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.590> lot

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
because the fluorocarbon will take a lot

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.630 
because the fluorocarbon will take a lot
of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.220> bumps<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.210> lot<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.900> knocks<00:01:56.680> I'm

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
of the bumps a lot of the knocks I'm

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.109 
of the bumps a lot of the knocks I'm
going<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.820> talk<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.240> about<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.689> son<00:01:59.170> line

is<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.470> bit<00:03:11.739> more<00:03:11.890> twisting<00:03:12.900> episode

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
is a little bit more twisting episode

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.670 
is a little bit more twisting episode
slightly<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:15.190> feels<00:03:15.580> hard<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:17.230> fish<00:03:17.410> with

slightly and it feels hard the fish with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.130 
slightly and it feels hard the fish with
but<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.640> still<00:03:18.879> not<00:03:19.090> too<00:03:19.150> bad<00:03:19.480> compared<00:03:19.900> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
but it's still not too bad compared to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.199

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
fluorocarbon lines but it was my choice

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.770 
fluorocarbon lines but it was my choice
I'd<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.620> going<00:03:26.830> for<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.099> SC<00:03:27.430> rock<00:03:27.780> because

thinner line diameters i will allow you

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.610 
thinner line diameters i will allow you
