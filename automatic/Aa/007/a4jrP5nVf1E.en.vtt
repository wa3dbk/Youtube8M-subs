00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 so people 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 exit fiddle hour with on said me 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.200
 make the video alone 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.000
 the reason because I so often ask her how 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.430
 and where do I get my watch from? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 I have to admit the clock is 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.170
 actually only self-made that is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 the big secret as I do that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.760
 I can show you in the video 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 all he needs is just 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 a wristwatch 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.770
 it does not even have to work anymore 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 is actually directly as only 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 is still on it and you thus 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 Actually, something always works 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 needed you need a knife yes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 I know that it is not a knife 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 actually only one blade the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.390
 is packed but that's enough 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.269
 we need a bit of black 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 Adhesive film and I have one with me 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.060
 blogger the word is exactly 3 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.330
 cm wide is that it just on it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.120
 going 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.890
 if you handle the knife well 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.750
 Of course you can do that too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.930
 cut out by hand, but I say it 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.729
 also the same or is an easy one 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.690
 Difficulty Well, what's up now 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.759
 Remove the adhesive film 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.789
 the part should be cleaned in my 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.180
 If this is enough, it will be easy 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.930
 just glued on and every clock they had 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.609
 the glass has such a an action indoors 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.079
 small frame then you just press 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:42.479
 here with the fingernail in that short pure 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.320
 you also see where you cut and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.840
 now it becomes easy with the cutter here 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.859
 once cut the dogs 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.729
 I do not think that makes me that 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.079
 first time 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.939
 I have a company that does something like that 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.859
 but I do not motivate 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.020
 that you tell me they do it all 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.909
 wanted to get me or wanted to order 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 so do not let me please that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.200
 but it makes itself out of the reason goes that way 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.970
 quickly with me the clock is black 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.860
 now is deducted there is one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.770
 carrier film still on it now you should 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.980
 stick that straight 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.980
 just take a look 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.660
 well, that's just what I stand for 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.820
 here between camera tripod and you can 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.480
 that's why it's not so good but that 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.250
 It was finished the clock and now 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.310
 his boss because he is 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.640
 Anytime what time it really is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.080
 Now a lot of fun for him to see 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.080
 schwaighofer and out
