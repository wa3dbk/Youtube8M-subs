00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.520

 this is in the tab couriers and neutrals 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.250
 there is such a command as using keys 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.010
 from the hero panel, that is, you will have the same 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 teams that the abilities of the characters too 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.340
 very convenient I advise you to tick 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.710
 I have the following items 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.720
 on the keys of the numbers that is 1 subject 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.690
 odnodochka second example. 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.430
 and so on the shop quickly purchase and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.800
 purchase fixed items from me 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.950
 nothing here is worth it as I just 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 click the next player with the mouse 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.370
 here we will stop in more detail in dota 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.530
 people are divided into two types are those who 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.420
 controls the camera with the mouse and those 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.260
 who controls the camera with 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.990
 keyboard 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.180
 I belong to the second group that is 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.470
 make the camera forward i have w 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.870
 move backward with left and right end 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.750
 here the main thing is this setting 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.480
 camera also can still change the key 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.700
 votes over which will be convenient for you 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.519
 I would like to point it out 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.319
 helpful commands to respond quickly 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.400
 seagulls 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.890
 let's say if you know that somewhere 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.310
 there is an enemy nearby and you have no time 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.220
 write 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.590
 carefully there for example the forest in ra you 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.470
 just can click on that 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.739
 which is configured to command carefully and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.730
 also with the teams we need wards 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.799
 tea for help access and so on 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.190
 the next tab is simpler these earrings 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:41.239
 I donâ€™t know the team 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.989
 console key loading and principle 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.780
 Everybody is here 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.360
 and the last tab is the observation here 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.270
 principle, you can leave everything while we 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.180
 we will not use these commands 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.390
 Now let's talk about the dota game modes. 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.810
 8 game modes available is a dead end 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.190
 captain's mode single draft random 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.190

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.420
 reverse how he looks he doesn't 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.670
 and the play all pick sheet is available to you 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 All heroes to choose from that is can 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.440
 choose any that you like 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.160
 capture can usually used in 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.560
 team games ie clanwars where 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 teams play against teams here 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.880
 hero choice 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.180
 provided only to the captain of the teams 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.070
 in the character draft mode the player rolls 3 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.210
 random hero of which he must 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.250
 pick one 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:42.440
 About random in this mode to each player 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.240

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.630
 In this mode, the player is given several 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.610
 characters and within 20 seconds he 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.910
 must choose one of them 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.210
 concrete where well here everything is clear the game is on 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.270
 pure mid is usually suitable for games 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.310
 one on one in laz mode you poet 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.390
 those characters that are not available 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.940
 won least recently shaft 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.710
 released an update in which they 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.230
 added task for 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.300
 newbies for starters can go through this 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.940
 task there will be described all that 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.520
 you will need to do also have 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.790
 training with bots betting 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.790
 difficulty level of bots and play 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.440
 lobby you can create a game with friends 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.000
 either against other players and either against 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.700
 other team if you have 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.630
 any team you're just taking off 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.490
 this game name and password and all 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.230
 the next is find a private game this 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.320
 the same as the lobby is only here you 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.170
 do not create a game and already join 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.360
 what a certain that is you 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.410
 gives the password output and see the name 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.930
 this game you created and go to 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.870
 This game is next to find a team game. 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.860
 here if you have 5 people in the group 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.730
 for example, the team can also be purely in 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.480
 randomly play someone have a clan-war 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:15.410
 the next is find a game with bots here 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.710
 just one mode and crowds rush with 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.860
 choose the difficulty and look for the game here 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:26.540
 you will play with people against bots 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.340
 that is, 55 people and 5 bots have not yet 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.080
 He said such an important thing as 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.420
 I advise you to choose the regions 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.340
 Russia Western Europe and Eastern 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.699
 Europe as there server 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:43.800
 best and you will have less spin and 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:46.410
 let's start so after we 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.060
