the<00:05:08.420> program<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.350> how<00:05:09.470> many<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.710> us<00:05:09.770> are

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
the program so how many of us are

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.220 
the program so how many of us are
there's<00:05:12.080> too<00:05:12.230> many<00:05:12.350> questions<00:05:13.990> Jason<00:05:14.990> Bourne

to<00:05:39.639> wipe<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:39.940> most<00:05:40.120> valuable<00:05:40.630> assets<00:05:41.020> we've

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
to wipe the most valuable assets we've

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.860 
to wipe the most valuable assets we've
ever<00:05:41.410> put<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.770> field<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:43.479> start<00:05:43.810> to

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
ever put in the field you start to

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.240 
ever put in the field you start to
consider<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.289> magnitude<00:05:44.800> of<00:05:44.919> what<00:05:45.069> we<00:05:45.190> were

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
consider the magnitude of what we were

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.510 
consider the magnitude of what we were
facing<00:05:45.460> disp<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.090> sideways<00:05:46.389> on<00:05:46.720> us<00:05:47.370> he<00:05:48.370> did

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
facing disp you sideways on us he did

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.490 
facing disp you sideways on us he did
what

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
what

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.780 
what
meaning<00:05:51.500> we<00:05:51.650> will<00:05:51.770> burn<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.100> program<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
meaning we will burn the program to the

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:11.469 
meaning we will burn the program to the
ground

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.979
