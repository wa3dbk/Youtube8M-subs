00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.410
 or the comfort I'm cristian castedo 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.950
 welcome to what will be our 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.439
 second tutorial for the dj school 220 p 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.570
 in our first tutorial we knew what 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.730
 which is the team also to differentiate 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.310
 the sounds to make a good 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.590
 very basic mix if you have not seen it yet 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.660
 I recommend it to you before you look at this 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.239
 video in this second tutorial 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.340
 we will learn about the ppm and in what 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.769
 moment the dj applies us the best 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.570
 good way we are in the disco 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.580
 blues where the past much of my 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.860
 working time where I had 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.360
 good experiences and other very crazy 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.640
 so let's go to the good cabin already 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.370
 we are in the cabin now let's go to 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 our first point that are those of pm 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.010
 bpm means beats per minute or 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.860
 so you have a much clearer idea 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.769
 they are blows that mark time or 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.590
 speed of each song for example a 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.940
 subject may have many or very few bits 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.670
 per minute 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.189
 let's listen to two examples one with 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.579
 many bits per minute that it becomes 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.579
 very 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.700
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.050
 now let's listen to a song with 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 very few bits that can become 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.710
 very slow 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:53.870
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 as you may have noticed people in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.620
 parties or concerts applauds dances or 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450
 move your head according to the beats 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.640
 minute of each song that they are 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.700
 listening at that moment if not yet 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.130
 you have clear this subject of bpm not you 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.210
 worry because with practice what 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.210
 you will understand much better 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.269
 Good for plain marearnos more we will 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.390
 listen to two rock songs so 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:39.180
 general in this genre goes 60 bits by 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.220
 minute at 150 170 bits per minute 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.019
 let's listen there if he says he has 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.019
 the bits per minute very slow 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.940
 this song tells us 93 bits for 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.940
 minute now let's mark the time 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.500
 now we go with our next 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 song 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.420
 this song tells us 137 pitt by 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.099
 minute 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.099
 now let's mark the time 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.990
 how can you tell this genre is 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.460
 very broad with respect to bits by 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.620
 minute 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.620
 let's go now with hip hop 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.170
 usually in this genre is the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 80 to 95 97 bits per minute 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.280
 this song tells us with 96 bits per 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.870
 minute 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.870
 now let's mark the time 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.990
 and let's go with our last example let's 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.990
 to catch an electronic song 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.460
 in this house musical genre goes from 124 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:34.759
 bits per minute to 130 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.319
 this song tells us 126 bits for 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.580
 minute 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.580
 now let's mark the time 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.699
 as we can see in these three examples 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.349
 the bits per minute are different and so 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.080
 we can listen to many genres 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.319
 musicals more each with their time and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.319
 speed 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.300
 because it's important for a dj the bits 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.640
 per minute at the time of mixing we go 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.880
 to go to practice I will select two 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:25.310
 electronic music songs 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:29.150
 let's hear the first the first 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.080
 gives us 125 bits per minute we go with 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.080
 our second theme 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.409
 this tells us 129 bits per minute what 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.169
 what we are going to do is equal the two 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:48.210
 songs the one has 124 we are going to 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:50.669
 get to 127 sorry 125 to 127 the other 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:55.110
 There are 129 bits per minute let's get 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.240
 to 127 and so the two are the same as 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.939
 we do it remember the first 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.930
 tutorial let's match the speed and 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.930
 then catch the blow 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.360
 very well the two songs are with the 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.200
 same speed are with the blow 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.970
 precise match the blow now it's just 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.820
 issue of adjusting the speed and 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.520
 keep the constant once we are 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.520
 sure of that we make the mixture 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.589
 as they saw we equaled the beats and 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:07:00.460
 we took the blow very well to have 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:03.219
 a very precise mix as you see this 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.559
 btm issue is important but it is 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:07.360
 very essential that you know recognize the 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.789
 speed and time of each song 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:14.580
 this was all in our second 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.580
 tutorial of dj school 220 p
