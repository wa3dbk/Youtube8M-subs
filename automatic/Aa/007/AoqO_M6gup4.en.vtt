tutorial on color matching so you got
two<00:00:08.280> images<00:00:08.639> one<00:00:09.330> you're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.750> grab<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
two images one you're going to grab the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.259 
two images one you're going to grab the
image<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.950> other<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
image from and the other one is the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.379 
image from and the other one is the
background<00:00:12.559> so<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> masking<00:00:14.610> job<00:00:14.849> take

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
background so you do a masking job take

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
background so you do a masking job take
that<00:00:15.540> object<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.289> image<00:00:16.619> moving

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that object from the first image moving

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.349 
that object from the first image moving
into<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> second<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.730> realize<00:00:18.150> oh

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
into the second one and you realize oh

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.599 
into the second one and you realize oh
my<00:00:18.420> god<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.320> colors<00:00:19.619> are<00:00:19.740> different<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:20.550> do

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
my god the colors are different what do

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.099 
my god the colors are different what do
I<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:21.800> fairly<00:00:22.800> easy<00:00:23.400> quick<00:00:24.180> fire<00:00:24.449> way<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> get

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
I do fairly easy quick fire way to get

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.980 
I do fairly easy quick fire way to get
this<00:00:25.289> done<00:00:25.910> there<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.029> much<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.630> advanced

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this done there are much more advanced

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
this done there are much more advanced
ways<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.039> probably<00:00:29.580> give

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
ways to do this and will probably give

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
ways to do this and will probably give
you<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> much<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.539> accurate<00:00:30.810> result<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you a much more accurate result in the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
you a much more accurate result in the
end<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.420> I'm<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
end but I'm just going to do this the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
end but I'm just going to do this the
fastest<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> know<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> know<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
fastest way I know so you know the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940 
fastest way I know so you know the
easiest<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> done<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.950> let's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
easiest way to get it done so let's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.729 
easiest way to get it done so let's
begin<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.790> these<00:00:41.940> two<00:00:42.410> layers<00:00:43.410> here

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
begin we have these two layers here

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.619 
begin we have these two layers here
right<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.040> simple<00:00:44.969> starting<00:00:45.210> layers<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.600> have

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
right now simple starting layers we have

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
right now simple starting layers we have
our<00:00:45.780> background<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.219> horribly<00:00:47.579> masked

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
our background and the horribly masked

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.069 
our background and the horribly masked
model<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.700> where<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:51.000> you're<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
model so where do we go you're going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
model so where do we go you're going to
grab<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.829> layer<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
grab the layer that you need to have the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.950 
grab the layer that you need to have the
colors<00:00:54.360> matched<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.280> duplicate<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.840> set<00:00:57.840> its

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
colors matched on duplicate it set its

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560 
colors matched on duplicate it set its
blending<00:00:58.320> mode<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> color<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.359> then<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
blending mode to color and then go to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.850

than<00:02:01.979> what<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.329> said<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:04.170> have

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
than what we need like I said we have

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
than what we need like I said we have
this<00:02:04.439> opacity<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:05.820> much<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.240> we

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this opacity so we want as much as we

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.139 
this opacity so we want as much as we
possibly<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:08.149> luminance

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
possibly can get out of this luminance
is<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.569> tricky<00:02:09.810> why<00:02:10.800> did<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.039> change<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
is a little tricky why did I change it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
is a little tricky why did I change it
if<00:02:11.550> we're<00:02:11.700> only<00:02:11.849> grabbing<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> color<00:02:12.569> what

the way down if we had it all the way up

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.900 
the way down if we had it all the way up
I'll<00:02:39.310> show<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.040> realistic<00:02:42.370> anymore

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
I'll show you not so realistic anymore

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.120 
I'll show you not so realistic anymore
we<00:02:43.390> don't<00:02:43.569> want<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.870> keep<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.040> way

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
we don't want that keep it all the way

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.750 
we don't want that keep it all the way
down<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.100> there<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.519> hit

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
down and that's all there is to it hit

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.830 
down and that's all there is to it hit
OK<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:51.340> basically<00:02:51.519> done<00:02:52.060> except<00:02:52.630> I'm

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
OK and we're basically done except I'm

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.360 
OK and we're basically done except I'm
just<00:02:53.080> going<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.350> drop<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.830> opacity<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.220> this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
just going to drop the opacity of this

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.670 
just going to drop the opacity of this
down<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:56.410> 60<00:02:57.900> there's<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> couple<00:02:59.140> other<00:02:59.440> little

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
down to 60 there's a couple other little

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.330 
down to 60 there's a couple other little
things<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.670> should<00:03:00.880> probably<00:03:01.150> work<00:03:01.630> on

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
things that we should probably work on

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
things that we should probably work on
next<00:03:03.340> step<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.760> matching<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> black<00:03:04.690> point

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
next step is matching the black point

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.530 
next step is matching the black point
and<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:06.730> be<00:03:06.940> completely<00:03:07.480> fair<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:09.540> probably

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and to be completely fair I probably

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.809 
and to be completely fair I probably
chose<00:03:10.780> two<00:03:11.049> source<00:03:11.349> images<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.920> aren't<00:03:12.519> good

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
chose two source images that aren't good

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.160 
chose two source images that aren't good
for<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.209> because<00:03:13.390> they're<00:03:13.690> black<00:03:13.840> points

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
for this because they're black points

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.020 
for this because they're black points
are<00:03:14.290> already<00:03:14.560> probably<00:03:14.860> pretty<00:03:15.340> even<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
are already probably pretty even and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.650 
are already probably pretty even and
also<00:03:16.840> they're<00:03:16.989> white<00:03:17.200> points<00:03:17.530> but<00:03:18.510> let's<00:03:19.510> see

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
also they're white points but let's see

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.300 
also they're white points but let's see
what<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.019> do<00:03:20.140> we're<00:03:20.769> going<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.950> create<00:03:21.250> a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
what we can do we're going to create a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.120 
what we can do we're going to create a
clipping<00:03:21.459> mask<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:22.290> after<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.560> group<00:03:23.980> these

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
clipping mask here after we group these

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.289 
clipping mask here after we group these
two<00:03:24.340> together<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.820> you're<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.150> going<00:03:25.269> to

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
two together so you're just going to

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.349 
two together so you're just going to
group<00:03:25.660> these<00:03:25.780> two<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.560> curves<00:03:26.769> now

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
group these two in this curves now

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.240 
group these two in this curves now
create<00:03:28.359> clipping<00:03:28.510> mask<00:03:28.630> all<00:03:29.470> we're<00:03:29.950> saying<00:03:30.069> is

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
create clipping mask all we're saying is

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.280 
create clipping mask all we're saying is
this<00:03:30.400> curves<00:03:30.640> only<00:03:30.970> affects<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.390> group<00:03:31.660> not

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
this curves only affects this group not

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.099 
this curves only affects this group not
the<00:03:32.650> layer<00:03:32.859> underneath<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.900> I'm<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:35.049> to

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
the layer underneath it I'm going to

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.880 
the layer underneath it I'm going to
choose<00:03:35.230> black<00:03:35.440> point<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:38.530> we're<00:03:38.829> just

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
choose black point and now we're just

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.500 
choose black point and now we're just
going<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.100> select<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.670> black<00:03:39.940> point<00:03:40.180> right

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
going to select that black point right

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.059 
going to select that black point right
there<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.290> looks<00:03:41.470> like<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.920> should

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
there because that looks like it should

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:51.220 
there because that looks like it should
be<00:03:42.160> pretty<00:03:42.280> black<00:03:43.139> white<00:03:44.139> point<00:03:45.060> right<00:03:46.060> there

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.610 

right<00:03:52.230> there

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
right there

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.830 
right there
pretty<00:03:53.520> good<00:03:53.760> next<00:03:54.420> thing<00:03:54.510> we're<00:03:54.599> going<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> do

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
pretty good next thing we're going to do

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.370 
pretty good next thing we're going to do
is<00:03:55.020> just<00:03:55.200> set<00:03:55.349> this<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.650> luminosity<00:03:58.790> and<00:04:00.380> I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
is just set this to luminosity and I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.449 
is just set this to luminosity and I
think<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:03.690> are<00:04:03.870> pretty<00:04:04.200> damn<00:04:04.620> good<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:07.459> yeah

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
think we are pretty damn good and yeah

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.030 
think we are pretty damn good and yeah
we're<00:04:08.819> we're<00:04:09.420> done<00:04:09.660> look<00:04:10.170> how<00:04:10.290> easy<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.709> was

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
we're we're done look how easy that was

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.870 
we're we're done look how easy that was
that<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.400> pretty<00:04:12.390> fast<00:04:12.750> pretty<00:04:13.709> simple<00:04:14.130> now

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
that was pretty fast pretty simple now

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
that was pretty fast pretty simple now
there<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.269> still<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.660> couple<00:04:16.019> problems<00:04:16.290> and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
there is still a couple problems and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.590 
there is still a couple problems and
that<00:04:16.889> lays<00:04:17.160> mostly<00:04:17.639> in<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.970> lighting<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that lays mostly in the lighting of the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.569 
that lays mostly in the lighting of the
image<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.959> that's<00:04:19.260> because<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.950> backlit

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
image and that's because this is backlit

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.690 
image and that's because this is backlit
this<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:21.120> frontlet<00:04:22.280> fixing<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.580> as

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
this is frontlet fixing this is as

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.370 
this is frontlet fixing this is as
simple<00:04:24.000> as<00:04:24.180> burning<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.750> dodging<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
simple as burning and dodging the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.159 
simple as burning and dodging the
subject<00:04:25.889> make<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.729> look<00:04:26.940> like<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.450> lighting

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
subject make it look like that lighting

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.260 
subject make it look like that lighting
is<00:04:28.290> coming<00:04:28.530> from<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.740> back<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.190> you're<00:04:30.150> good

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
is coming from the back and you're good

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.260 
is coming from the back and you're good
to<00:04:30.300> go<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:31.610> since<00:04:32.610> you've<00:04:32.790> already<00:04:32.910> color

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
to go and since you've already color

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.340 
to go and since you've already color
corrected<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.780> don't<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.080> worry<00:04:34.229> about

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
corrected you don't have to worry about

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.170 
corrected you don't have to worry about
those<00:04:34.530> colors<00:04:34.800> anymore

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
those colors anymore

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.570 
those colors anymore
like<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.360> said<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.290> fastest<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
like I said this is the fastest and the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520 
like I said this is the fastest and the
easiest<00:04:39.000> way<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.300> get<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.660> done<00:04:39.720> there<00:04:40.500> are

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
easiest way to get this done there are

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.980 
easiest way to get this done there are
much<00:04:41.040> more<00:04:41.070> advanced<00:04:41.820> ways<00:04:42.030> than<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:42.419> ways

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
much more advanced ways than this ways

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.780 
much more advanced ways than this ways
that<00:04:43.200> will<00:04:43.320> get<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.560> much<00:04:44.010> more<00:04:44.280> accurate

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
that will get you much more accurate

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.180 
that will get you much more accurate
color<00:04:44.910> representations<00:04:45.780> those<00:04:46.500> ways<00:04:46.770> involve

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
color representations those ways involve

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.070 
color representations those ways involve
dropping<00:04:47.460> lots<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.570> color<00:04:48.810> information

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
dropping lots of color information

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.530 
dropping lots of color information
points<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.830> trying<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.340> match<00:04:50.490> them<00:04:50.729> up<00:04:50.820> this

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
points and trying to match them up this

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.650 
points and trying to match them up this
way<00:04:51.780> involves<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.320> simple<00:04:52.620> command<00:04:53.220> I'm<00:04:53.660> not

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
way involves a simple command I'm not

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.390 
way involves a simple command I'm not
saying<00:04:55.050> don't<00:04:55.380> use<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.800> more<00:04:55.950> advanced<00:04:56.190> ways

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
saying don't use the more advanced ways

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.440 
saying don't use the more advanced ways
if<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.760> have<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.210> time<00:04:57.440> learn<00:04:58.440> them<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.610> this

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
if you have the time learn them but this

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.290 
if you have the time learn them but this
way<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.020> quickest<00:05:01.470> surefire<00:05:02.250> way<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:03.000> get

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
way is the quickest surefire way to get
