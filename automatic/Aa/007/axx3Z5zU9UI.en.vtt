00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.100
 a rereading that is calmer more serene able to transmit dialogue 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.420
 with the light dialogue with all spaces that are calm mothers 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.420
 mejÃ­a beautiful in that sense allows a much more free life 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.390
 believe that I believe that it is definitely two one the 1 would want a thousand percent my 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.490
 intention as an architect and that is what there was also attempts to transmit to the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.750
 students when one as a teacher 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.380
 faithful and try to teach this is to do something reading to make the 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.200
 others that may also sound a little bit more Gothic but it's not from 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.850
 the oce, because that would be stupid that we try to make a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.260
 reading that was the amazement of the deaf of the people and where it was 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 impossible to live 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.080
 mushrooms that way at this moment for example from some sheets 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.400
 the script I sleep and teruel with white sheets that I think are the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.590
 suitable when you sleep well 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.500
 p there sheets how they see the showcases sheets with lace with 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.190
 embroidery are a thousand colors that must be a point a torture sleeping in neza 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.790
 common sheets do not know what he does there inside that thing he brushed 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.910
 that wonderful one that will have 80 prospered red to the pincha could not be given 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.910
 in the colors he wanted to be min 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.900
 can not they percent made face 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.810
 it is much simpler born more comfortable a good cotton sheet 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 or of me not without calm mix intact 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.049
 I think the history of the ghetto further 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.169
 will be there the buildings the architectures that make up the wait of 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:32.959
 the reading 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.909
 he is always difficult that although he coursed worked with quotation marks very well 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.009
 paquet that are to serve the bad people suffer federal to the 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.259
 functions proposed measures proposed in the client in those buildings 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.329
 not for sculptural brilliance bruera will be the sculptors 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:53.189
 is what was said when I was a student cc to art culture is an art 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.519
 with reason of need 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.579
 I think it's good 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.819
 It is very clear that it is clear that if the crisis does not fulfill the functions for 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.859
 what is done did not make sense it is just like a car that will not work author 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.659
 very precious leaks that rarer car more atomic more 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.859
 ipora 1 a ferro that will work if it did not cooperate because it would have few means that 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:14.329
 for not 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.429
 does not have an end other than that the car was armed earthquake 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:21.359
 It has to work is given of course contract the electronic and the adventure 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.539
 that one proposes but not that one as does what I saw advocacy for 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.489
 example that the reading has to allow 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.859
 to the people who live there unhappy 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.180
 and with an athletic freedom and lead it to the concept of freedom is also 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.389
 it sounded very complete
