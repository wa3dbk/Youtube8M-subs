00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.309
 hello everyone I’m a bone and today how 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.170
 and promised i'm starting on passing 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.410
 contracts hitman absolution 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.660
 and we start with the contract of my one 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 of my closest friends on y tube 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.060
 this is a man with a nickname big shot him 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.039
 I chose the contract because he created 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.949
 Won legend there principle everything 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.660
 original cool passes and he 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.629
 complicated like you know love 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 we have three goals this is a trio of cops on 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.640
 locations a sledgehammer operation there in prison and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.550
 2 we have to kill him with a wire 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.829
 is an analogue of strings and 1 bare hands during 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.379
 all this is done in outer clothing 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.019
 the guard of the manor burnout and with the first 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.339
 missions and he came up with the name don't 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.469
 touch my silver ballers 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.239
 and the complexity is naturally a legend that I 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.859
 he actually likes the contracts 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.139
 because on medium difficulty I rarely 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.659
 I pass them for them not very generously pays 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.729
 Yes, and in general and the guys here it is yes 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.590
 disguise which I spoke and pistol 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.450
 which we do not need at all because 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.720
 that he he is not used here as 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.160
 murder weapon goes a long load and with 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.500
 these contracts, I initially 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.300
 fell for when a yura threw him to me 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.430
 The first time I can not go I do not know 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.940
 why but I did not work all the time 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.730
 watered 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.950
 and the conditions here are first and foremost 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.900
 do everything as indicated by the jura that is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.960
 kill us with the same weapon hide bodies and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.760
 and not to get caught by anyone 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 it 's hard to do everything here 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.350
 because there are a lot of guards on the legend 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.360
 on every mission here we start and with 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 the very beginning we sit on the chair later i 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.240
 will tell you why and although the principle can 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 and now tell yes if we first 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.400
 let's go hit the button stapled guard 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.070
 then when he comes here 47 will be very 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.080
 long untie from the chair and in general 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.970
 then we will not have time then during the kill they 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.580
 noticeably our goals and we are fired therefore 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 first we sit break out then hit 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 on the button and sit down on the chair again because 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
 that as soon as you sit down the second time 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.629
 147 already 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 he won't be in seconds 15 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.019
 untie the hands and immediately get up 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.849
 here he came the guard is our second 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.020
 his goal we will not kill immediately in the second 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.670
 queue because we still do not even have 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.590
 electric wires and the string here is not 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.970
 fit as a weapon in general we get up 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.680
 as soon as he turns away from us and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.950
 neatly we pass over there 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.690
 there is an electric wire on the table 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.150
 and talking on the phone is our first 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 the goal that we are now successful with you 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.650
 but by suffocation he would stand back and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.050
 no problems should arise 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.010
 sneak up behind our backs and put our minds on 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.420
 and on the neck cord and immediately hide in the body 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.160
 Jurassic there are no conditions here not to change 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.680
 the main thing is to kill all three targets 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.450
 it was in the clothes of the manor’s guard 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.280
 then when we kill them all the same 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.320
 change my clothes to leave the contract so 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.510
 and how to get out through the door where 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.370
 we remember the storyline 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.160
 They took their guns there very much 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.240
 the cops or your suit pass 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 unrealistic to the exit well, at least 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.500
 I did not work at all I think you can 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.060
 but not in contracts this is true 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.100
 maybe passing because for that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.500
 extra points give here in contracts 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 do everything as quickly as possible because 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.640
 that for the time here the bonus is given for 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.640
 what did you go in your costume here 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.140
 nothing you really do not give so well 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.520
 we take the iron pipe she us 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.070
 will need to attract him 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720
 third goal and running and running through the grass 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.420
 because I 'm talking to you 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.790
 try to act on speed and in 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.500
 Generally we get here we open 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.150
 the door and now need to run the script 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 dialogue which will start only when you 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.530
 come here and look at the third 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.450
 goal he will talk to the drunk 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.410
 whom they catch here every year 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.080
 fair in the compartment 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.120
 and now we’ll join in here and 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.150
 wait for them to speak now 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.070
 and everyone will go here even though they are there 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.310
 only two of this drunkard 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.900
 our third goal drunkard will pass very 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.630
 more then we leave somewhere 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.420
 iron pipe to her go third 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.820
 the goal and its we are actually there naked 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.330
 I 'll kill with my hands because I don't understand 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.400
 why Yura did all three cord 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.170
 I do not know why he chose the latter 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.840
 just bare hands but okay not me 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.550
 to judge and he created his right just 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.560
 I fulfill the principle of a contract to me 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.299
 liked like such complex not very 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.830
 hardcore repeat and just such 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.710
 complex you are not too simple 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.020
 in general, now they are already saying 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.729
 I have everything in English again like you 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.110
 noticed i'm not going to change back on 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.820
 Russian because English me 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.340
 five more well and that's when they already 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.120
 will go here you define it by dialogue 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.590
 on subtitles 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.530
 Well, or if you have a Russian voice acting, then 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.390
 so hear and basically we hide here 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.990
 here and now I'll show you what 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.750
 the moment it is necessary to throw the pipe and where 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.370
 I actually had to throw it, I was talking 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.260
 with yuri and he seems to have gone differently 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.940
 he followed them into the camera I distracted 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.610
 the guard elsewhere and hid too 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.070
 he is not here i am therefore my way of him from 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.860
 it will be different here we are it 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.860
 attracted he comes in and now we break 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.960
 in his neck and hide the body container after 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.530
 why change clothes and just get out of it 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.990
 contract that's all throw his body in 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.330
 the container he's already there is one brats 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.860
 resting and in general interrupted like me 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.540
 already said and now we will go out 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.190
 why do we need instinct not 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.230
 waste it up to this point all we go out 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.080
 we neatly like this 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.580
 roll com we get over there by 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.130
 I get another failed 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.320
 I was poured though I think it's real 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.270
 if to climb through the mine but then they will give 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.130
 less points per contract but because 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.170
 all the same time is taken into account the faster 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.150
 you passed the more points you will be given 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.580
 All in all we are on this contract 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.920
 completed and now see our account 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.870
 as far as I noticed the money for the contract 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.430
 pay only when you first pass it 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.440
 if you repeat the same 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.330
 contract many times you are not already 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.610
 pay and even if they pay something very very 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.950
 little but don't know maybe wrong but me 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.180
 it would seem so let’s k-lite 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.460
 you can evaluate a contract to it 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.870
 I liked the principle and click 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.050
 continue now we will see the rating 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.950
 worldwide and natural 1 okay 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.260
 cool happened 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.210
 played a total of five people including jurassic and 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.860
 they could not get to my 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.290
 the number of points is the coolest 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.180
 feeling very much at that end 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.160
 I'll see you in passing later 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.320
 I do not know when the contract will be when 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.060
 I want to do it with you I was a bone 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.960
 subscribe comment all the luck and 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.960
 pack and new meetings
