00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and I do like putting my graphics up to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.530 
and I do like putting my graphics up to
the<00:00:30.990> max<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.410> much<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> next<00:00:31.830> guy<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.540> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
graphics are pretty much I think where

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240 
graphics are pretty much I think where
we<00:00:39.270> need<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.649> articulate

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
we need them to be they articulate

things<00:00:41.460> very<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.750> cutscenes

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
things very well we don't need cutscenes

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.220 
things very well we don't need cutscenes
and<00:00:43.760> pre-rendered<00:00:44.760> CG<00:00:45.270> cutscenes<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.930> show

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and pre-rendered CG cutscenes to show

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
and pre-rendered CG cutscenes to show
off<00:00:46.410> things<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> rely<00:00:48.600> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
off things we don't have to rely on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
off things we don't have to rely on
sprites<00:00:49.050> anymore<00:00:49.440> except<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
sprites anymore except when we want to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.750 
sprites anymore except when we want to
now<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.020> day<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.289> age<00:00:52.379> games<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.489> pretty

now at this day and age games are pretty

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 
now at this day and age games are pretty
much<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:54.870> need<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.829> grand

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
much up to what they need to be grand

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.299

theft<00:00:56.550> auto<00:00:56.730> 5<00:00:57.000> especially<00:00:57.600> proves<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
theft auto 5 especially proves that

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
theft auto 5 especially proves that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
720p argument because honestly at the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.440 
720p argument because honestly at the
end<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> day<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> negligible

a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> times<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.340> games<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.790> there

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
a lot of times there are games out there

a lot of times there are games out there
on<00:01:36.479> older<00:01:36.780> systems<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.590> look<00:01:37.740> better<00:01:37.860> than

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
on older systems that look better than

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
on older systems that look better than
games<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> things<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.170> art

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
games now because of things like art

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.260 
games now because of things like art
style<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.490> always<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.119> having

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
style it's not always about just having

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
style it's not always about just having
the<00:01:42.420> most<00:01:42.540> realistic<00:01:42.960> looking<00:01:43.380> game<00:01:43.560> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the most realistic looking game of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679 
the most realistic looking game of
course<00:01:43.979> many<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.659> of

course many of you know that a lot of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
course many of you know that a lot of
times<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.140> comes<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
times it comes down to just a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
times it comes down to just a
beautifully<00:01:47.610> designed<00:01:48.149> game<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.290> way

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
beautifully designed game and the way

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
beautifully designed game and the way
things<00:01:49.470> look<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.189> things<00:01:50.310> sound<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
things look and the way things sound and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
things look and the way things sound and
everything<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:51.990> gonna<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.140> now

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
everything and what we're gonna have now

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
everything and what we're gonna have now
with<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> next-gen<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.280> confident<00:01:54.060> ways<00:01:54.180> we

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with the next-gen are confident ways we

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
with the next-gen are confident ways we
can<00:01:54.570> implement<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
can implement that because I think the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
can implement that because I think the
graphics<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:57.689> less<00:01:57.719> where<00:01:58.350> they

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
graphics are more or less where they

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.929 
graphics are more or less where they
need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.890> games<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.430> handle<00:01:59.759> themselves

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
need to be games can handle themselves

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
need to be games can handle themselves
in<00:02:00.360> 3d<00:02:00.780> personally<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.590> looking<00:02:02.009> forward

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
in 3d personally I'm not looking forward

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.429 
in 3d personally I'm not looking forward
to<00:02:02.369> how<00:02:02.640> much<00:02:02.850> leaves<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.869> rendered<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to how much leaves can be rendered on a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.770 
to how much leaves can be rendered on a
tree<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.280> into<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> new

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
tree I'm more into what kind of new

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
tree I'm more into what kind of new
gameplay<00:02:07.170> mechanics<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.799> work<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.099> how

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
gameplay mechanics we can work in how

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.089 
gameplay mechanics we can work in how
far<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.209> draw<00:02:09.390> distance<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.679> how

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
far can that draw distance really be how

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.940 
far can that draw distance really be how
many<00:02:11.340> characters<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.540> cram<00:02:12.840> here
