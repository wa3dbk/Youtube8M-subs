00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
 in a pretty fast hairdo tutorial so 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
 for your lazy days do not hesitate to 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.690
 think about this style of hairdressing it's very 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.400
 easy to do and it's going super great 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.290
 quickly it feels good sometimes to change 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.730
 hairdressers whose girls are seized in 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.379
 any case if this style interests you I 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.150
 leave you right away with the tutorial 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:07.360
 it's gone then to begin I 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.729
 take this so that is near my neck 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.900
 and I put it right here so in mind I 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.030
 let go of course 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 then I take this and I will do 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.149
 a mat so a 13 caciques a very 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 easy to do I divide into three 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.259
 first parts second part and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 third part and I start to 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.009
 train 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.270
 so if you do not have the habit 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.430
 know that there are plenty of tutorials 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.289
 definitely on youtube to learn 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.509
 to make a truce and then wheat but 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.530
 it's very easy in you will see there 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.530
 I'm doing a classic truce 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.070
 once I'm done I take this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.250
 so a little black elastic of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.250
 preference 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:11.400
 and to properly fix manade game the task 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.930
 just down then once I have 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.120
 finished to give a little character to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.250
 the braid and give it a loose effect 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 I will come thicken so I have 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.180
 started in water that's it and I do like 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.340
 this i will start down sooner 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.709
 so I hope you will see wyss and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.739
 here you are and I undo a little this 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.330
 truce by spreading a little on the sides 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.569
 and I keep going up to the top 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 loosened it's really the style of 13 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.830
 I love my city the style of the facts 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.730
 headdresses and I love it a lot 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.170
 especially for braids so here 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.350
 do not hesitate to do it everywhere 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.769
 down to the bottom he could also do at 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.769
 finger 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.379
 this is what we have this time will have 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.269
 not stay like that we will tackle 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.840
 this part there and also make a 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 classic grip 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.010
 I share in you and of course this one 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.010
 will be much smaller 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.310
 Once I reached the end I fitted 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.340
 of course a small elastic always 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.360
 a black elastic is more discreet 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.100
 but after you can take what 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:55.500
 you want and I end up with two 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.720
 braids a bigger and messy and 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.760
 a smaller and very tight so 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.640
 I'm going to fix this one so the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.360
 smaller in the middle of the braid 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.350
 disheveled and you have this effect one 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.030
 you will see it's very pretty 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.610
 for the fixed and I'm going to use some 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.470
 little pins like this so black 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.720
 again and of course I will 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.230
 discreetly come and fix them just 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.120
 behind to keep the little girl 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.430
 mat and especially do not hesitate to well 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.780
 set the second date in the middle of the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.850
 first of a series that we really 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.890
 disheveled to make it bigger 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.630
 and wilder you do that it's 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.340
 well in the middle like these and you 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.340
 discreetly attach to small pins 

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:07.209
 and that's the result girls I hope 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.559
 that this tutorial you liked it is really 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.329
 very easy to do so do not hesitate 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.889
 not to make them to change 

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:13.569
 hairstyle from time to time I make you 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.589
