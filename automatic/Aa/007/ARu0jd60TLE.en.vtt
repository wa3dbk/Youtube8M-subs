one-on-one at this point and you can see

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.600 
one-on-one at this point and you can see
the<00:01:28.350> team<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.619> coming<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.920> against<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the team we're coming up against is a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
the team we're coming up against is a
four<00:01:29.880> three<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.630> he<00:01:30.840> does<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.229> Memphis

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
four three two one he does have Memphis

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770 
four three two one he does have Memphis
to<00:01:31.680> pay<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> McGee<00:01:32.369> witch<00:01:32.640> solving<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to pay and McGee witch solving well it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.030 
to pay and McGee witch solving well it
sort<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> makes<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> he's<00:01:34.860> going

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
sort of makes me think that he's going

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
sort of makes me think that he's going
to<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.250> using<00:01:35.369> skills<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> his<00:01:36.000> team<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.390> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to be using skills in his team and so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
to be using skills in his team and so

the same so I can't say anything about
it<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:49.020> luckier<00:01:49.320> though<00:01:49.439> because

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
it I was a bit luckier though because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.139 
it I was a bit luckier though because
he's<00:01:49.740> goalkeeper<00:01:50.159> completely<00:01:50.759> missed<00:01:51.030> the

when package of picking them up on the
bins<00:03:10.200> actually<00:03:10.500> found<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.769> whole<00:03:10.950> load<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.430> was

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
bins actually found a whole load I was

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.190 
bins actually found a whole load I was
very<00:03:11.700> lucky<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.180> find<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.480> many<00:03:12.689> in<00:03:12.870> one<00:03:12.989> go<00:03:13.169> I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
very lucky to find that many in one go I

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.379 
very lucky to find that many in one go I
think<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.469> got<00:03:13.620> four<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.430> time<00:03:14.669> which<00:03:15.209> was

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
think I got four in one time which was

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.270 
think I got four in one time which was
awesome<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.109> that's<00:03:16.260> more<00:03:16.530> profit<00:03:16.919> there<00:03:17.069> and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
awesome so that's more profit there and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
awesome so that's more profit there and
yeah<00:03:18.150> now<00:03:18.329> we're<00:03:18.479> going<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.870> play

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989

fitness game and I played them and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.640 
fitness game and I played them and
they've<00:03:24.629> obviously<00:03:24.750> got<00:03:24.959> down<00:03:25.199> in<00:03:25.349> fitness

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

season<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.900> chose<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.319> most<00:03:28.500> difficult

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
season I chose the most difficult

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.259 
season I chose the most difficult
division<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.519> could<00:03:29.729> we<00:03:29.879> played<00:03:30.030> against

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
division that I could we played against

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.879 
division that I could we played against
Newcastle<00:03:30.659> we<00:03:30.959> did<00:03:31.109> win<00:03:31.290> 3-1<00:03:31.590> which

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
Newcastle we did win 3-1 which

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.770 
Newcastle we did win 3-1 which
admittedly<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.699> lot<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.150> difficult<00:03:33.299> than

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
admittedly is a lot more difficult than

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.099 
admittedly is a lot more difficult than
losing<00:03:34.680> well<00:03:35.069> winning<00:03:35.370> 10<00:03:35.669> nil<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
losing well winning 10 nil and but you

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.869 
losing well winning 10 nil and but you
know<00:03:37.139> still<00:03:37.500> wasn't<00:03:37.979> all<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.129> much<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.669> a

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
know still wasn't all that much of a

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.729 
know still wasn't all that much of a
strain<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.989> was<00:03:40.109> more<00:03:40.260> difficult<00:03:40.379> as<00:03:40.680> I

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
strain but it was more difficult as I

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.319 
strain but it was more difficult as I

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
got disconnected but we are starting get

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.240 
got disconnected but we are starting get
back<00:05:07.050> on<00:05:07.229> track<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.439> little<00:05:07.680> bit<00:05:07.889> more<00:05:08.069> and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
keeper and it was his right foot which

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.200 
keeper and it was his right foot which
is<00:05:48.719> his<00:05:48.960> weak<00:05:49.139> fit<00:05:49.349> admittedly<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.129> so<00:05:51.029> I<00:05:51.089> was

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
is his weak fit admittedly and so I was

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.820 
is his weak fit admittedly and so I was
like<00:05:51.360> oh<00:05:51.479> god<00:05:51.719> we<00:05:51.900> could<00:05:52.050> end<00:05:52.199> up<00:05:52.289> losing<00:05:52.500> and
