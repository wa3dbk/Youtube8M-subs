00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
casting on stitches there are many

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.860 
casting on stitches there are many
different<00:00:07.740> ways<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.919> cast<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.610> stitches<00:00:08.970> but

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
different ways to cast on stitches but

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.499 
different ways to cast on stitches but
the<00:00:10.019> first<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.469> always<00:00:10.889> involves<00:00:11.670> making<00:00:12.150> a

the yarn the ball wrap it around your
fingers<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.699> make<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> loop<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:28.500> short<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
fingers to make a loop take the short it

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.470 
fingers to make a loop take the short it
under<00:00:30.260> behind<00:00:32.450> then<00:00:34.190> inside<00:00:35.450> through<00:00:36.450> the

under behind then inside through the
loop<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:39.540> makes<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.050> knot<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> pull

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
loop this makes a knot that if you pull

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
loop this makes a knot that if you pull
