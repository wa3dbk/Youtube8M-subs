00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello friends welcome to the kitchen of 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.870
 You bleed aha area as it was happening 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.019
 count and you see I am doubling my voice and 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.389
 I'm speaking Spanish but if I 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 I'm folding but well I look like 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.669
 more abnormal today we're going to learn how to do 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.430
 a nutella pizza how to make a 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.710
 Nutella pizza because if this is the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.739
 video we teach ourselves to catch potatoes from 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.399
 garden let's make a pizza 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.399
 nutella 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.050
 and this you are asking why I do 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.900
 I do not know what to do with video and in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.350
 instead of doing something chorra I'm going to do 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.350
 this 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.960
 The first thing we need is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.470
 approximately 350 grams of flour 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.630
 Water 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 yeast 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.320
 a pot of sugar is possible that this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.520
 full of sugar a pinch of salt oil 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 made of olives 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.660
 milk and how not nutella 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.920
 and something to decorate we started throwing 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.700
 all the flour in above that of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
 where we want to work the dough 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 I look too professional talking 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 so we make a hole in the middle with the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.500
 fingers and we throw all the envelope of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.840
 yeast and sugar that pretty much 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.560
 we want it to be comfortable after 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 we add a little salt do not miss 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.710
 with salt just to give it flavor and what 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 we mix everything there so more or less 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.880
 then we put everything together again in a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.830
 bunch and we'll do it again 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.140
 again a hole in the middle because I've 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.560
 said twice again I do not know 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.150
 we throw a little milk because it is not 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.130
 totally necessary in this reality 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.630
 but so that they are sweeter we are going to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.690
 use a little milk as you see 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 we have to start doing laps with 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.040
 fingers in the middle of the hole and if 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.930
 It sounds a bit weird but well that's it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.060
 how do you make the pizza dough up 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 that more or less you are adding water 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.700
 until more or less you see that it stays 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.890
 that is staying like a mass 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
 consistent and it becomes a ball and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.350
 those that we like to pring 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.630
 I feel but in this mass you are going to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.600
 pringar as well as I just 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.910
 primary because I am equal when 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 have the mass more or less consistent 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.590
 we splash a little oil that 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.260
 what it will do is gather the mass more and have 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.700
 that has more strength happens to us and neither 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.680
 much with oil or flour 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 because otherwise the dough will not stay very hard 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 and voilÃ  now we have to do that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.300
 appear a plate from scratch and cover it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.600
 with one with a cloth the pussy 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.200
 we let the dough rest while we 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 we can light the oven or fight the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.390
 heat or just clean what we have 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.540
 messed up what is going to touch him 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.540
 my 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 Y 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 we have already let the dough rest and what 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.870
 we are going to do is stretch it with a 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.190
 roller having put charity before 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.500
 down so you do not see after 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.620
 we put the dough in a mold of the oven 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.390
 when we have it stretched and with a 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.490
 fork or something I have Vincho 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.830
 to do a few holes because 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.020
 if we do not make balls in the oven 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.550
 after having done little holes with 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.190
 the fork what we have to do is 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.090
 as a kind of curb around 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.470
 of the mass with the fingers so poc for 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.210
 that the curb of all the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.210
 clues we go more than anything 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.540
 austin little by little he's doing 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.540
 the goal video money 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.699
 once we have this done the only thing that 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.020
 we have to do is put the dough that 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.110
 by the way we have to have put the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.810
 oven that I'll have put it out there to 12 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.180
 180 degrees a little while before while 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.069
 we let things rest tell me that no 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.810
 I'm the only subnormal who knows 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.970
 printer forget the pan with oil 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.970
 inside and I've already turned on the oven 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.820
 no no no 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 ah 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.919
 we already have the mass so what I have to 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:13.669
 to do is spread nutella all over the track 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.769
 as if it were tomato but with cloth or 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.380
 nocilla what you want what you prefer 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:21.980
 This is to taste what I think 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.780
 once greased 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.850
 Well what we have to do is 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.020
 decorate it or put something on it that I know not 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.810
 it is not necessary that the one of corais but I 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.490
 I put this is the house and while 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.990
 that as you almost all remember you 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.390
 that you can follow me on twitter that 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.970
