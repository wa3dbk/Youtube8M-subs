 square panther brick towers 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.070
 they were black silhouettes against the sun at 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.540
 sunset 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.310
 denis could say the singing of the priests 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.760
 reds that lit the fires for the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.489
 night 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.250
 the cries of children playing at 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.290
 beyond the wall of the villa delirium for a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.050
 moment I want to be out there with 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.200
 them barefoot breathless 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.880
 dressed in rags I wish I didn't have 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.310
 in the past 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.380
 but more than anything I wish to 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.320
 don't be forced to go to that 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.870
 party in the palace of cal drogo da 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.180
 somewhere beyond twilight 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.730
 beyond the narrow sea it stretched 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180
 a land made of green hills of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.400
 plain and full of flowers of great rivers 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.470
 a land in which stone monoliths 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.320
 dark rose among splendid 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.210
 mountains of rock-colored steel and 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.010
 knights in armor threw themselves into 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.370
 battle following the banners of the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.090
 their lords the dothraki called it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.250
 racean from there land of the Andari in the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.850
 free cities instead spoke of 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.860
 westeros and the kingdoms of sunset 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.390
 his brother used a much longer name 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.709
 simple our land 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.970
 words that for him were like one 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.620
 prayer 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.140
 if he had spoken a number 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.650
 enough of the idea in the end 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.380
 our earth would have fulfilled it for 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.110
 right of blood that was brought to us 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.080
 away with the betrayal but still ours for 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.810
 always a serious one is committed 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.380
 mistake to steal from the dragon because the dragon 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 remember maybe it was true 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.800
 maybe the dragon remembered it well instead not 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.660
 he remembered he had never seen the earth 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.330
 that his brother said belonged 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.720
 them the kingdom beyond the narrow sea 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.480
 those places of which he spoke castel 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.560
 granite and tall garden eagle's nest 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.980
 and the valley of arms 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.370
 don and the island of faces for her were 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.169
 only words viserys was 8 years old 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.139
 when they had been forced to flee 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.330
 from landing of the king retreating in front 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.550
 to the advance of armies 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.010
 of the observer at that time generis 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.980
 it was nothing more than a little flame of 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.300
 life in her mother's womb 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.730
 yet his brother had spoken it 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.650
 so often of that time that 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.130
 there were moments in which denis sought 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.650
 to imagine seeing the night escape 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.780
 to the rock of the dragon the light of the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.940
 moon that slipped on the black sails of the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.100
 ship his brother regard that 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.700
 they fought on the pad hours in the waters of the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.130
 trident reddened by blood and died 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.410
 in the name of the woman who loved 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.139
 plundering of the king's landing by 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.560
 lords the meester and stark the dogs 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.570
 of the observer called viserys la 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.870
 princess elia of dorna who invoked 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.030
 mercy the heir to records that 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.640
 he was torn from the breast and killed 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.310
 before his eyes the empty eye sockets 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.370
 shiny skulls of the last dragons 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.200
 in the throne room blind looks that 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.650
 they observed the exterminator at work 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.750
 say silent witnesses while the blade 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.169
 of a golden sword tore his throat 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.180
 of the king his father will be born there 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.940
 dragon rock 9 moons after all 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.070
 this during a summer hurricane 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.320
 so violent it almost smashed 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.120
 the island in two 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.690
 they said it was a storm 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.690
 scary the targaryen fleet had been 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.760
 it is still destroyed by huge blocks 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.130
 of stone had fallen into the water 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.139
 bubbling of the narrow sea 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.530
 his mother had died giving birth to it 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:54.680
 and for this reason his brother did not have it 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.169
 never forgiven could not remember 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.060
 the pure rock of the dragon were 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.830
 escaped again just before the 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.289
 the observer's brother took the 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.139
 sea ​​with its new fleet 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.810
 then the ancient dragon rock 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.030
 residence of the license plate house was everything 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.330
 what remained of the seven kingdoms which is a 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.780
 time they did n't even belong 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.960
 this was however destined to last so 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.960
 their wanderings had started from 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.200

 his brother did not allow the assassins 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.300
 of the observer continued to put them on 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:41.330
 he also said if denis never had 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.750
