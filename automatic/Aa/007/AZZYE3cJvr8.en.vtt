00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.480
 this is addressed to all 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.480
 those who call themselves 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.480
 critics 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 those who dare 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.660
 make value observations regarding 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660
 others 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.100
 the first thing you should do 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100
 is look in the mirror yourself 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.650
 to see what you see reflected 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.810
 a work of interiorization of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.730
 internal introspection of knowing who 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.480
 you will help you to be able to criticize a 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 most successful way 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.430
 and more offensive 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.620
 really the critic 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.309
 it is never usually positive 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 the critic always has an intention 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.910
 destructive 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.370
 but you have never asked us 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.760
 maybe when you criticize so much 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.090
 is that your insecurity 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 and not accepting how you are makes 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 reject 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.170
 what puts you in evidence 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.470
 We criticize who speaks correctly 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.659
 expresses properly saying that goes 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.579
 ready 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 because we do not recognize that we would have to 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.600
 have finished the egb and that our 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.450
 knowledge or by our 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.760
 intellectuality evidently leaves a lot 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.920
 what to wish 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560
 We criticize who is strong who has 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.870
 a good physique from the couch with a 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.690
 important belly eating hamburgers 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.390
 and living beers without losing saying 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.080
 They are fagots but because we say it 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 because we do not really look in the mirror 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.119
 and we have not seen anything for a long time 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.260
 instead of moving, it 's much easier 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.570
 try to destroy 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.450
 and so we could continue in many 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340
 examples that everyone understands so 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.200
 so much remember that the one who criticizes 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.289
 destructive way 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.130
 all he does is demonstrate 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.040
 its impotence its inability 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.220
 to improve and be 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.380
 someone they talk about 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.600
 but also thinking one thing no p no 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.260
 try never to be average 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 fairly media 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 and that people all people speak well 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.239
 of you 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.720
 because then it will mean that you are not 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.720
 media 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 Y 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.770
 training
