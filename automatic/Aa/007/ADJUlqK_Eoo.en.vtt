00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
other 5.00 firmware you probably would

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200 
other 5.00 firmware you probably would
update<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> something<00:00:34.410> better<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.309> other

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
update it to something better so other

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
update it to something better so other
