00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
here's a picture of the back added some

here's a picture of the back added some
gold<00:01:42.010> fo<00:01:42.460> no<00:01:42.670> plugs<00:01:43.060> there<00:01:43.650> I've<00:01:44.650> also<00:01:44.890> added<00:01:45.280> a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
gold fo no plugs there I've also added a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.760 
gold fo no plugs there I've also added a
standby<00:01:46.480> switch<00:01:46.720> as<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.290> see<00:01:47.500> just

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
standby switch as you can see just

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.090 
standby switch as you can see just
they're<00:01:48.040> not<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:50.020> probably<00:01:50.410> need<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.920> for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
they're not they probably need it for

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.450 
they're not they probably need it for
the<00:01:51.190> Jesus<00:01:51.580> 34<00:01:52.710> rectifier<00:01:53.710> too<00:01:54.010> but<00:01:54.190> it's<00:01:54.310> got

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
the Jesus 34 rectifier too but it's got

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.310 
the Jesus 34 rectifier too but it's got
in<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.670> because<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.120> slow<00:01:55.330> startup<00:01:55.870> but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
in it because it's a slow startup but

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.960 
in it because it's a slow startup but
we've<00:01:56.470> done<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.650> anyway<00:01:57.070> because<00:01:57.250> we<00:01:57.490> can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
we've done it anyway because we can

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.420 
we've done it anyway because we can
let's<00:01:58.690> get<00:01:58.930> have<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.560> look<00:01:59.710> inside<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.040> quick

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
let's get have a look inside a quick

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.330 
let's get have a look inside a quick
rundown<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.910> what<00:02:01.180> we've<00:02:01.330> done<00:02:02.130> we've<00:02:03.130> got

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
rundown of what we've done we've got

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.400 
rundown of what we've done we've got
we've<00:02:03.520> used<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.940> original<00:02:04.060> speaker<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
we've used the original speaker and the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.710 
we've used the original speaker and the
original<00:02:05.940> cabinet<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.240> we<00:02:07.330> didn't<00:02:07.510> have<00:02:07.540> to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
original cabinet so we didn't have to

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
original cabinet so we didn't have to
make<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.429> here's<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.149> chassis<00:02:10.980> as<00:02:11.980> you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
make that and here's the chassis as you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160 
make that and here's the chassis as you
can<00:02:12.280> quickly<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:14.440> use<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.860> same

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
can quickly see we use the same

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.480 
can quickly see we use the same
transformers<00:02:17.170> obviously<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> same

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
transformers obviously and the same

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.860 
transformers obviously and the same
chassis<00:02:19.800> same<00:02:20.800> valves<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:23.410> look<00:02:24.310> at<00:02:24.400> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
chassis same valves but look at that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.949 
chassis same valves but look at that
completely<00:02:25.870> different<00:02:26.880> I'll<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.270> I'll<00:02:28.720> do

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
completely different I'll do it I'll do

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.170 
completely different I'll do it I'll do
a<00:02:28.989> really<00:02:29.290> close<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.160> another<00:02:30.430> camera<00:02:30.760> in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
a really close up with another camera in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180 
a really close up with another camera in
a<00:02:31.270> minute<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.959> see<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> components

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
a minute so you can see the components

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.400 
a minute so you can see the components
really<00:02:33.340> close<00:02:33.640> up<00:02:34.890> cts<00:02:35.890> fully<00:02:36.190> imports<00:02:37.410> sprang

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
there we go there's a more close-up

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.640 
there we go there's a more close-up
picture<00:04:14.990> of<00:04:15.020> it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:39.540

so<00:04:40.120> different<00:04:40.449> difficult<00:04:41.020> one<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.199> look<00:04:41.530> up<00:04:41.680> on

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
so different difficult one to look up on

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.409 
so different difficult one to look up on
the<00:04:41.949> internet<00:04:42.340> actually<00:04:42.699> this<00:04:42.849> one<00:04:43.090> because

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
the internet actually this one because

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.140 
the internet actually this one because
there's<00:04:43.660> very<00:04:44.160> few<00:04:45.160> people<00:04:45.610> who<00:04:45.849> have<00:04:45.970> done

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
there's very few people who have done

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.710 
there's very few people who have done
this<00:04:46.389> one<00:04:46.660> on<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:47.800> particular<00:04:48.160> ramp<00:04:48.720> it's

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
this one on this particular ramp it's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.680 
this one on this particular ramp it's
not<00:04:49.840> an<00:04:49.930> easy<00:04:50.050> one<00:04:50.349> to<00:04:50.500> do<00:04:51.870> probably<00:04:57.449> I'd<00:04:58.449> take

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
not an easy one to do probably I'd take

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.749 
not an easy one to do probably I'd take
some<00:04:58.900> stills<00:04:59.259> as<00:04:59.500> well<00:05:02.400> as<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.520> might<00:05:03.639> have

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
some stills as well as you might have

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.189 
some stills as well as you might have
seen<00:05:04.000> we've<00:05:04.270> added<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.470> Justin<00:05:06.460> bias<00:05:06.759> and<00:05:07.199> the

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
seen we've added the Justin bias and the

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:24.710 
seen we've added the Justin bias and the
hundred<00:05:08.530> ohm<00:05:08.729> resistors<00:05:09.729> to<00:05:09.759> do<00:05:10.060> your<00:05:10.210> bias<00:05:10.389> on

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.220
