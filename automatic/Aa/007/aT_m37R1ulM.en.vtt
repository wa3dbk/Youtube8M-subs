00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:06.198
 Your mission will pull a lot, sir. 

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:08.063
 I know that, Rifild. 

00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:18.276
 I guess Alexander Grasson will not come. 

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:20.620
 I'm sure he'll show up with burglaries. 

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:22.665
 Ladies and gentlemen... 

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:26.999
 ... it's a pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Alexander Grasson. 

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.182
 In the LONDON ... 

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:32.811
 Ladies and gentlemen... 

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:35.009
 ... I give you tonight ... 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:36.188
 ...power. 

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:42.891
 ... a legendary POWER ... 

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.932
 Alexander Grasson. 

00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:45.055
 Jonathan Hacker. 

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:48.378
 And here's my beloved girlfriend, Miss Miss Morey. 

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:49.894
 Mina. 

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:52.605
 Feel... 

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:54.949
 That you know me. I was thinking exactly the same thing. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.635
 ... has been awakened. 

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:07.343
 For over a decade ... 

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.661
 ... we have created this empire of lies. 

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:13.813
 We know you're dead. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.289
 Every brother who shames the Grayson should be punished. 

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:23.149
 I will find him and destroy him. 

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.240
 Attract and drown it. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.372
 You have the strength to take it. 

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.364
 To turn it into something like me ... 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.004
 ... it would be a degrading act. 

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:40.327
 FROM THE PRODUCERS OF DOWNTON ABBEY 

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:47.585
 AND THE TUDORS DRAWER 

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:52.978
 LOVE IS HIS LOVE 

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:56.267
 -We are at the dawn of a great change. - What do you mean by that? 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.572
 This is what Mr. Doun told us. 

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.092
 The man is evolving. 

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:02.332
 THE EXPRESSION IS IN HIS BLOOD 

00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:06.436
 We must first redefine ourselves to develop our species. 

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.650
 MIRACLES NEVER DIVE
