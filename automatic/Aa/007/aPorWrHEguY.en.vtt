definitely be when Max is napping he
takes<00:03:12.950> two<00:03:13.220> naps<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.579> day<00:03:13.609> usually<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.349> would

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
takes two naps a day usually so I would

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.589 
takes two naps a day usually so I would
just<00:03:15.889> you<00:03:16.340> know<00:03:16.370> pick<00:03:16.669> my<00:03:16.790> battle<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:17.419> need<00:03:17.569> a

shower<00:03:18.519> during<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.760> nap<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.209> would<00:03:20.419> do<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.569> but

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
shower during a nap I would do that but

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.170 
shower during a nap I would do that but
that's<00:03:21.200> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> take<00:03:21.590> up<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.220> good<00:03:22.819> part<00:03:23.030> of

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
that's going to take up a good part of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.870 
that's going to take up a good part of
his<00:03:23.329> nap<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:23.989> then<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.500> will<00:03:25.459> probably<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.760> my

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
his nap so then I will probably do my

can't accomplish everything the way I
would<00:03:31.370> like<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.819> but<00:03:32.419> I<00:03:32.690> do<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.079> in<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
during one of his naps then I probably

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.500 
during one of his naps then I probably
take<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> shower<00:03:55.609> during<00:03:55.970> his
