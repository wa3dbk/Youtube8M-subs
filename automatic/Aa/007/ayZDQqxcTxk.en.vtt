00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello to all she is one of 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.709
 stars of the mercedes booth 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 Geneva who is currently holding the 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.730
 Here is already the test on caradisiac 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 it is the mercedes cls shooting 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:28.470
 brake for this is the mersey has 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.619
 taken again the concept of the shooting brake 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.379
 inaugurated on the key to know how to give a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.150
 break cutting attributes and this gets 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.680
 see especially at the doors 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.700
 or there is no coaching but also 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 the back part 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 overall this is the shooting 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 break is definitely more successful than the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 sedan status quo at the level of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 dimensions 4 m 63 are the same as 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.530
 those of the main sedan 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 difference is at the level of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.199
 change of the look on the part 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.199
 back of the diet 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750
 1 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
 without any surprise we find the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
 dashboard from there it's the sedan 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
 inside this cls shooting brake 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
 alternating the good and the bad 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.830
 gold the good is for example this plate 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.630
 high level aluminum console 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.939
 very nice central very well integrated 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 with circular aerators he 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.940
 was really very good years you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 also have stitched leather at all 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.640
 first effect as well as magnificent 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.259
 seating 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.789
 so that's less positive things 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.340
 however we regret a little bit 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.720
 integration by a successful entry of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.330
 the middle multi tablet of as long as 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.640
 this one is not tactile to review 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.020
 also the quality of plastics high 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.399
 level down the center console 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.110
 we would have hoped for better then the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.759
 main change in the dish that's it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.289
 it's the shooting brake it's 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.789
 the increase of the roof guard of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.929
 more than 4 cm 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.550
 result you to carry 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.560
 quietly more passengers 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.990
 one meter 80 at the level of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.179
 the habitability of passengers yes three 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.770
 passengers we will be a little bit 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.810
 unless you take a manikin 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.369
 German next to you the volume of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.549
 Loading the cls shooting brake 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.860
 also between 495 and 1400 liters 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.780
 it's 25 more than the c is the sedan 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.640
 at multi comparison it's solid from 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 more than a class c break but 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.780
 be careful when you can see 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.130
 access is relatively limited on 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 loading threshold over to honda duck 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.630
 classic so these practices we them 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.850
 elbows better so here we are at the wheel 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.320
 it's the shooting brake that's animated at 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.410
 the occasion of its launch by two 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.630
 diesel engines of 136 and 167 horsepower and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.579
 four petrol that range from 122 to 300 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.410
 horse care for amg version 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.470
 today we are it is the soft term 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.780
 with the 250 horsepower version 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.489
 coupled with a robotic box to seven 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.769
 reports but also to a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.430
 full transmission 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.109
 overall this marriage is very 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.090
 attractive because we really do 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.650
 a secure vehicle that does not have 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.359
 managed to fault what 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.760
 are the traffic conditions 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.500
 especially today where we dealt 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.120
 to slippery roads under a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.350
 temperature of 2 3 degrees had in 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.489
 more snow 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.350
 so much to say right away very car 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.609
 very very reassuring very comfortable 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.319
 so all that is good points 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.700
 we are more mixed on the other hand 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.209
 on the engine as indeed 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.859
 211 horses 352 m of torque and 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.730
 unfortunately it misses deeply 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.010
 of the ina 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.330
 yet the car is quite light and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.790
 you have to switch to manual mode 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.680
 or sport to benefit from some 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.819
 tonicity and it's a little bit a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.040
 disappointment because we thought that with 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.330
 200 horsepower on a gasoline engine 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.069
 was going to have a very dynamic car 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.390
 and that's not really the case that's it 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.650
 only at the motor level of course 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.950
 because at the side behavior like cabbage 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.900
 flower 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.940
 that's fine the direction is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.470
 nice to drive she is also pretty 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 consistent his good information 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.160
 on the other hand in terms of the vitality of the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.410
 engine these means so you'll get it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.360
 this shots alternating shooting brake 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.489
 the good and the bad the good is all 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.920
 regards the behavior the less 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.379
 well it's a little this engine 250 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.120
 who disappointed us mercedes took over the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.069
 recipe from the cls shooting break for his 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.569
 cla and as much say it right now 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.250
 it works why not what we have 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.440
 make a practical compact vehicle 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.150
 aesthetic that will seduce many 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.750
 small families at the level of 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.489
 temperament 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 we find the dynamic qualities of 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.359
 the sela even if they will be reproached 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.840
 perhaps 1250 petrol too 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.239
 linear 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.220
 the rates are we're going to say relatively 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.729
 classic for mercedes between 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.320
 30000 and 63100 euros and 7 c is the 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.770
 shooting break has mostly a big 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 advantage 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.090
 she's all alone on this segment
