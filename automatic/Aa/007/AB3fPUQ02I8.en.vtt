 an opponent to strike ahead 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.699
 the blow is struck from the front foot as 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.469

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.469
 stop the movement of the enemy 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:29.060

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.110
 throws 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.420
