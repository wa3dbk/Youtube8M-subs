just has this three drops of color and
then<00:00:32.220> instead<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> mixing<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.710> homogeneously

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
then instead of mixing it homogeneously

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.700 
then instead of mixing it homogeneously
I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.040> kind<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> mix<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.699> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.000> bit<00:00:36.330> and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.810 
it's kind of a dirt you know I call it
dirty<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.720> it's<00:00:40.080> not<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
dirty because it's it's not a

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
dirty because it's it's not a
homogenized<00:00:41.820> mix<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:43.170> I'll<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
homogenized mix and then I'll take a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
homogenized mix and then I'll take a
board<00:00:44.370> here's<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> fun<00:00:45.480> one

nobody has paint on it and put it on top
and<00:00:50.690> see<00:00:51.690> how<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.039> doing<00:00:53.039> its<00:00:53.309> own<00:00:53.430> little

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.200 
and see how it's doing its own little
fun<00:00:54.539> design<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> green<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.730> under<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.090> you

fun design the green is under there you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
fun design the green is under there you
can't<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> dries<00:00:59.070> clear

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
can't see it so when this dries clear

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.660

what's<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.539> fun<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.469> puts<00:01:01.829> fun<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.460> into

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
what's really fun it puts fun back into

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
what's really fun it puts fun back into
your<00:01:02.850> painting<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.930> no<00:01:04.170> idea

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
your painting because you have no idea

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.680 
your painting because you have no idea
what<00:01:04.649> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.009> look<00:01:05.190> like<00:01:05.690> because

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
what this is going to look like because

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.950 
what this is going to look like because
if<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.039> fun<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.960> if

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
if that's it that's fun for you if

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.990 
if that's it that's fun for you if
you're<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.680> control<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.460> fun

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you're really into control it's not fun

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.499 
you're really into control it's not fun
but<00:01:12.509> when<00:01:13.410> this<00:01:13.560> dries<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.729> green<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.209> under

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
but when this dries the green is under

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
but when this dries the green is under
the<00:01:15.630> under<00:01:16.050> there<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.709> know<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
the white is going to go clear and then

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:23.630 
the white is going to go clear and then
you're<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> green<00:01:23.550> in

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
orange and I would have preferred not to

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.660 
orange and I would have preferred not to
mess<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.410> up<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> other<00:01:25.950> thing<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.429> do<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
mess it up the other thing you can do is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.930 
mess it up the other thing you can do is
pour<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> GAC<00:01:27.450> 800<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.410> then<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.700> drops

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
pour the GAC 800 and then put the drops

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.760 
pour the GAC 800 and then put the drops
on<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.039> then<00:01:32.039> move<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.179> in<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> around<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
on and then move it in and around the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.589 
on and then move it in and around the
last<00:01:35.069> thing<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.429> wanted<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.910> is<00:01:36.209> it

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
last thing I wanted to show you is it

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.779 
last thing I wanted to show you is it
does<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.170> cool<00:01:37.500> marbleized<00:01:38.220> technique

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
does a really cool marbleized technique

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.490 
does a really cool marbleized technique
and<00:01:38.970> here's<00:01:39.539> here's<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.349> going<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and here's here's what it's going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.559 
and here's here's what it's going to
look<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.709> when<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.880> finished<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.420> I'll

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
look like when it's finished and I'll

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.589 
look like when it's finished and I'll
just<00:01:43.200> demonstrate<00:01:43.380> real<00:01:43.890> quick<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
just demonstrate real quick so if I just

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.199 
just demonstrate real quick so if I just
take<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.959> clear<00:01:49.170> tar<00:01:49.410> gel<00:01:49.709> and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.729> pour<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
take the clear tar gel and I pour it

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.919 
take the clear tar gel and I pour it
over<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.630> surface

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.880 

it's<00:01:55.929> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.259> crevice<00:01:56.590> because<00:01:56.770> it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
it's going to crevice because it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.429 
it's going to crevice because it's
pretty<00:01:57.009> thick<00:01:57.280> look<00:01:57.460> how<00:01:57.549> thick<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
pretty thick look how thick that is this

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.319 
pretty thick look how thick that is this
is<00:01:59.590> why<00:01:59.710> when<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.250> add<00:02:00.369> water<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.060> feel

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
is why when you add water you can feel

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.419 
is why when you add water you can feel
when<00:02:01.570> it's<00:02:01.719> loose<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.829> this<00:02:02.950> I'm<00:02:03.250> not

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
when it's loose but for this I'm not

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.279 
when it's loose but for this I'm not
going<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.149> add<00:02:04.240> water<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.780> I'm<00:02:05.049> just<00:02:05.079> going

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
going to add water to it I'm just going
