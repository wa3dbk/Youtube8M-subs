the past not just on the harmonica but

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
the past not just on the harmonica but

piano letting those influence you but
also<00:00:23.369> trying<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.880> something<00:00:24.240> new<00:00:24.449> I'm

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
also trying to do something new I'm

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.150 
also trying to do something new I'm
going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> give<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.619> an<00:00:25.680> example<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
going to give you an example of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to give you an example of
something<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:28.199> bit

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
something I think is a little bit

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
something I think is a little bit
different<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:30.210> much<00:00:30.390> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
different not it's not it's very much in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
different not it's not it's very much in
the<00:00:30.810> direction<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.320> blues<00:00:31.560> harmonica<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the direction of blues harmonica but I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.030 
the direction of blues harmonica but I
also<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.030> contemporary<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
also think it's contemporary and this is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
also think it's contemporary and this is
a<00:00:35.070> song<00:00:35.399> called<00:00:35.989> unlucky<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.140> love<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a song called unlucky and love that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.700 
a song called unlucky and love that

Stirling McGee mr. Satan my partner for

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.580 
Stirling McGee mr. Satan my partner for
many<00:00:40.770> years<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.250> Harlem<00:00:41.870> worked<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
many years in Harlem worked up and I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.670 
many years in Harlem worked up and I
worked<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.040> harp<00:00:44.309> line<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> basically

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
worked up a harp line that basically

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.840 
worked up a harp line that basically
doubled<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> lot<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> things<00:00:47.219> he<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.460> doing<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
doubled a lot of things he was doing on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.729 
doubled a lot of things he was doing on
guitar<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.510> think<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
guitar I think by the way that's one of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
guitar I think by the way that's one of
the<00:00:49.800> ways<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> move<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the ways in which you can move the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200 
the ways in which you can move the
instrument<00:00:51.210> forward<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> find<00:00:52.559> musicians<00:00:53.210> who

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
instrument forward is find musicians who

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
instrument forward is find musicians who
aren't<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.719> doing<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> same<00:00:55.260> old<00:00:55.320> Hollywood

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
aren't just doing the same old Hollywood

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.380 
aren't just doing the same old Hollywood

it<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.850> way<00:02:36.970> through<00:02:37.000> let<00:02:37.390> me<00:02:37.420> let<00:02:37.930> me<00:02:37.960> put

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
it all the way through let me let me put

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.050 
it all the way through let me let me put
down<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> mic<00:02:38.740> let<00:02:39.100> me<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.370> play<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> for<00:02:39.850> you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
down the mic let me just play it for you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.490 
down the mic let me just play it for you
I'm<00:02:40.120> gonna<00:02:40.270> actually<00:02:40.420> play<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.960> very<00:02:40.990> slowly

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
I'm gonna actually play it very slowly

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.710 
I'm gonna actually play it very slowly
so<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.400> at<00:02:43.210> home<00:02:43.360> if<00:02:43.480> you've<00:02:43.600> got<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
so that you can at home if you've got a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.460 
so that you can at home if you've got a
b-flat<00:02:44.020> Hartley<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.590> can<00:02:44.740> get<00:02:44.890> this

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
b-flat Hartley and you can get this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.620 
b-flat Hartley and you can get this
start<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:47.770> hole<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:54.280> just<00:02:54.730> there's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
start on the one hole now just there's

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.090 
start on the one hole now just there's
probably<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.990> lesson<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.710> dealing<00:02:56.830> with

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
probably a lesson in just dealing with

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.430 
probably a lesson in just dealing with
those<00:02:57.280> notes<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> did<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:59.020> let<00:02:59.140> me<00:02:59.230> let<00:02:59.410> me

those notes that I did so let me let me
let<00:02:59.710> me<00:02:59.740> improvise<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> lesson<00:03:00.700> right<00:03:00.730> now<00:03:00.960> all

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
let me improvise a lesson right now all

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.140 
let me improvise a lesson right now all
right<00:03:02.110> what<00:03:02.260> did<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.440> do

note you simply bend the note you bend

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.920 
note you simply bend the note you bend
the<00:05:16.710> Reed<00:05:16.890> that's<00:05:17.730> not<00:05:17.940> true<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.360> Bend<00:05:18.720> as<00:05:18.900> a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
the Reed that's not true you Bend as a

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.750 
the Reed that's not true you Bend as a
way<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.260> making<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.800> proper<00:05:20.160> pitch<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:20.670> the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
way of making the proper pitch but the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.670 
way of making the proper pitch but the
bend<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.270> not<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.570> pitch<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.050> it's<00:05:22.440> certainly

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
bend is not the pitch and it's certainly

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.500 
bend is not the pitch and it's certainly
easy<00:05:22.950> on<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.310> three-hole<00:05:23.640> draw<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:23.940> bend<00:05:24.360> it

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
easy on the three-hole draw to bend it

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.630 
easy on the three-hole draw to bend it
down<00:05:24.540> much<00:05:25.020> too<00:05:25.230> far<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:26.070> get<00:05:26.190> what<00:05:26.370> sounds

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
down much too far to get what sounds

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.980 
down much too far to get what sounds
like<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.820> really<00:05:26.970> funky<00:05:27.360> note<00:05:27.510> but<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:27.810> not<00:05:27.960> a

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
like a really funky note but it's not a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.290 
like a really funky note but it's not a
pitch<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.470> can<00:05:28.650> use<00:05:28.830> so<00:05:29.160> it<00:05:29.820> would<00:05:29.910> be<00:05:30.000> easy<00:05:30.210> to

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
pitch you can use so it would be easy to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.990 
pitch you can use so it would be easy to
go

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.760 

you<00:05:36.660> can<00:05:36.810> actually<00:05:36.960> go<00:05:37.200> you<00:05:37.320> can<00:05:37.410> get<00:05:37.530> four

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
you can actually go you can get four

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.120 
you can actually go you can get four
different<00:05:38.040> notes<00:05:38.100> on<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.430> three-hole<00:05:38.730> draw

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.230 

four<00:05:44.130> notes<00:05:46.490> which<00:05:47.490> one<00:05:47.700> do<00:05:47.820> you<00:05:47.880> want<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.120> use

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
four notes which one do you want to use

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.390 
four notes which one do you want to use
well<00:05:48.450> I'm<00:05:48.570> talking<00:05:48.870> about<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.920> first<00:05:50.190> one

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
well I'm talking about the the first one

00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:02.480 
well I'm talking about the the first one
down<00:05:50.550> off<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:50.940> top<00:05:59.930> that's<00:06:00.930> bone<00:06:01.410> Nats<00:06:02.070> bone

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
down off the top that's bone Nats bone

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:15.650 
down off the top that's bone Nats bone
that's<00:06:03.180> bone<00:06:03.690> full<00:06:13.669> now<00:06:14.669> in<00:06:14.940> some<00:06:15.150> cases<00:06:15.360> it's

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
that's bone full now in some cases it's

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.770 
that's bone full now in some cases it's
easier<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.560> hit<00:06:17.130> that<00:06:17.340> three-hole<00:06:17.880> draw<00:06:18.150> bed

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
easier to hit that three-hole draw bed

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.600 
easier to hit that three-hole draw bed
what<00:06:19.050> I'm<00:06:19.140> calling<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.590> blue<00:06:19.770> third<00:06:20.070> at<00:06:20.400> that

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
what I'm calling the blue third at that

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.240 
what I'm calling the blue third at that
little<00:06:20.820> quarter<00:06:21.240> tone<00:06:21.510> almost<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:22.110> half<00:06:22.950> tone

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
little quarter tone almost a half tone

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.250 
little quarter tone almost a half tone
Bend<00:06:23.550> it's<00:06:24.540> easier<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:24.870> hit<00:06:24.960> it<00:06:25.110> with<00:06:25.230> your

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
Bend it's easier to hit it with your

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260 
Bend it's easier to hit it with your
tongue<00:06:25.740> on<00:06:26.070> the<00:06:26.130> roof<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.340> your<00:06:26.400> mouth<00:06:26.520> kind<00:06:27.120> of

articulating like that right so that
might<00:06:34.800> be<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.070> way<00:06:35.100> of<00:06:35.310> doing<00:06:35.430> it<00:06:35.580> if<00:06:35.669> you're

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760

it up it's a little bit like here's a
best<00:07:20.310> example<00:07:20.400> is<00:07:20.820> an<00:07:21.150> airplane<00:07:21.420> when

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
best example is an airplane when

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.600 
best example is an airplane when
airplanes<00:07:22.410> traveling<00:07:22.770> at<00:07:22.830> high<00:07:22.980> speed<00:07:23.310> and<00:07:23.520> it

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
airplanes traveling at high speed and it

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.890 
airplanes traveling at high speed and it
wants<00:07:23.820> to<00:07:23.850> go<00:07:24.030> up<00:07:24.060> or<00:07:24.270> down<00:07:24.390> it<00:07:24.510> just<00:07:24.540> needs<00:07:24.780> to

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
wants to go up or down it just needs to

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.230 
wants to go up or down it just needs to
trim<00:07:25.170> slightly<00:07:25.680> right<00:07:25.920> and<00:07:26.130> and<00:07:26.820> and<00:07:27.060> that'll

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
trim slightly right and and and that'll

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.670 
trim slightly right and and and that'll
make<00:07:27.330> a<00:07:27.390> huge<00:07:27.480> difference<00:07:27.990> when<00:07:28.110> it's<00:07:28.290> a<00:07:28.500> lot

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 
make a huge difference when it's a lot

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.440 
make a huge difference when it's a lot
slower<00:07:28.920> on<00:07:29.310> landing<00:07:29.850> approach<00:07:30.090> you<00:07:30.210> can<00:07:30.330> have

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
slower on landing approach you can have

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.940 
slower on landing approach you can have
those<00:07:30.570> big<00:07:30.780> flaps<00:07:31.080> all<00:07:31.350> the<00:07:31.440> way<00:07:31.560> down<00:07:31.770> well

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
those big flaps all the way down well

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.870 
those big flaps all the way down well
that's<00:07:32.070> the<00:07:32.220> way<00:07:32.310> to<00:07:32.370> think<00:07:32.520> about<00:07:32.640> it<00:07:32.820> that's

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
that's the way to think about it that's

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.610 
that's the way to think about it that's
the<00:07:33.120> actually<00:07:33.540> an<00:07:33.630> analogy<00:07:33.960> that<00:07:34.020> that<00:07:34.500> really

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 
the actually an analogy that that really

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.860 
the actually an analogy that that really
does<00:07:34.800> explain<00:07:35.190> what<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:36.210> faster<00:07:36.600> the<00:07:36.690> air<00:07:36.810> is

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
does explain what the faster the air is

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.240 
does explain what the faster the air is

and I can see that I'm out of time so
we're<00:07:46.410> gonna<00:07:46.500> have<00:07:46.710> to<00:07:46.770> come<00:07:47.460> back<00:07:47.640> and<00:07:47.880> talk

about that that blue third and I want to

about that that blue third and I want to

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:51.810 
do it in three different octaves next

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.100 
do it in three different octaves next
