00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hi to all youtube friends here is the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.290
 your nigro 91 who is speaking to you today is 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 in your company to do another 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 gag profile profile and I had you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.190
 promised so much so much 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.710
 so long that many of you as 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.470
 they told me waited for him to wait from 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 so much and here I am finally I am 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.170
 managed to get the papers so vi 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 I show my spell book that I am testing 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.720
 months that are in different ways and for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 now the version I like best is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.559
 this I am going to propose 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.610
 then we start with three priests s 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.700
 pretty standard three jerks that are 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.879
 type ago stratos when I saw done 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 normally for discovery search a 12 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.640
 justice that get caught bottom the ex 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.359
 they are saved with wisdom and alain dream 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 walla remove and who you add a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 upper level 5 charmer light 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 darkness and a magic face book 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 then an angad minus a historian of the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.140
 prophecy that we say born we can 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.479
 say is to prove it 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.689
 then we have something that no one does 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.640
 expect that trembles Ciliani tell me 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 but this is stupid what the fuck we will get 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 Chilean then the images and in this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.680
 deck act as a tour for others 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 decks 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.329
 I hope to a deck that really has but 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.250
 really many problems and vocal 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.140
 normally monsters because of a few most 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.770
 revocable and the monsters they are 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.479
 irrevocable are small like the search 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.570
 nano 500 is the only other alternative to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.399
 a fileni and breaker that is true that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 throws youth under King etc. But 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.890
 magi she neither I like to die because 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.009
 it is a continuous recycling even it gets caught 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.369
 warning back in the deck this there is a 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.799
 strange ruling but it works so that the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.020
 stigma warning about magi she returns in 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.990
 bunch then to a continuous recycling 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.690
 then farmyard price 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.520
 always a power target every round 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 because enchanter is obviously a 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.989
 monster summonable normally for 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.970
 continue the combos you can do 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.150
 so I think they are excellent and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.630
 these things are probably useful 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.680
 of magic in this deck they understand it 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.569
 only those who tried to play 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.030
 on facebook because others would say 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.550
 this is the shitty card that happened to me 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.170
 because only two that I play from hopefully 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.930
 they played spare book they told me 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.970
 hell of the image 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.739
 the others have all said that sucks 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.470
 shit kart etc. so on then 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.569
 however 3 but there she and then a third that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.840
 is on which omics and charmer does book 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.700
 I think it's big 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 then it can leave spaces passed by 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 something else better 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.150
 then three hvaler because on spellcaster the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.510
 level 1 target of very big life two 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.670
 maxi these as antrops and together with 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.530
 two goals knows that you do with tower 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.160
 one of the most absurd and among those becomes 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.160
 gigantic then will come consistency 2 pod 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:24.070
 then ser cini 3 secrets 2 tower this 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.950
 which is a tower proxy that I don't have 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.870
 so i'm looking for a tower i remember looking for 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.630
 another of these whoever you 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.130
 contacts because I try and anyway 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.900
 also beautiful in the version with i 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.690
 villages and charmers even though tower is 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.910
 too big then other staple 3 wisdom 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.310
 palalancia on charmers and not 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.359
 two power attack decreases and that's it 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.290
 because there is no room for the third 2 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.420
 eternity to add the removed ones 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.639
 spurlock removed and a lost faith 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.760
 which is the second largest speck book 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.440
 me there is caius i remove okay i remove 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.090
 3d new and then bore reaches with 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 eternity then a continuous loop that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.970
 big or life that I would like to put the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.709
 second, however, there is no room for it 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 now a magical and useful dimension 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.139
 for others it is the alternative to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.730
 miraculous wand that combines with the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.110
 maghetto 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.960
 when left there you can do 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.850
 maghetto add 1 magical dimension 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.610
 shooting shot for head and braggart company 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.860
 sorry that I renounced it 1 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.700
 so in short, then you are 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.800
 of course the reborn ways and how 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.800
 Traps game ripping braids 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.010
 that is like a single trap and a big one 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.840
 in short or less minus 1 to the opponent is 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.510
 that leaves him enough if you are not 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.550
 the only among the extra plate games that 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.920
 obviously to be changed absolutely 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:05.420
 But though I am proceeding so a url 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:11.850
 stardust scrap black crowes scatÃ  star 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:15.090
 libraria are my arm formula si si 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.970
 game because the chef shooting at young man e 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.550
 then when you break the tower you retire 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.830
 the other formula is also true of energy 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.930
 fish one is big in short, I like it 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.520
 master charioteers to be replaced 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.970
 probably with a tiramisu when the 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.860
 i will find sought a plot on mainas her 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.890
 and tano tintin paolo cats cats and from 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.390
 taste for taking off levels 2 at random 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:48.750
 that you have on the ground well this was the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.760
 deck profiles melbook that with the various ones 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.250
 thirds that I put that I like 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.230
 for now enough and then now i'm in 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.530
 another light darker version 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.550
 to prove that I will try comics today 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.350
 probably between today and maybe 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.930
 next week because tomorrow I think 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.470
 to play it more or less like that perhaps with 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.120
 a car modification and therefore nothing this 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.890
 it was the deck profile i hope you are there 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.560
 liked it if you liked it, I recommend it 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.860
 like me down here and sign up 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.260
 cuasso on top of my channel and nothing 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.050
 I would say that everything is nigro 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.220
 I'll see if in this in the next tournament 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.390
 I can have a child 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.700
 in case you don't succeed you will have a help e 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.940
 otherwise we see ourselves in the future or the next 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.530
 video I have to too 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.540
 so let's see you at the next trade 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.540
 video on youtube love you
