fast navigation but sometimes you want

fast navigation but sometimes you want
to<00:04:35.440> work<00:04:35.680> more<00:04:36.130> precise<00:04:36.669> then<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.600> should

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
to work more precise then you should

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.630 
to work more precise then you should
lower<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.350> value<00:04:38.770> just<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.669> little<00:04:39.970> bit<00:04:40.180> I
