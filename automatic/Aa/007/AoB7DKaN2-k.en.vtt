back<00:00:00.359> in<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.630> 1960s<00:00:01.589> we<00:00:01.770> were<00:00:01.920> told<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.460> the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
back in the 1960s we were told that the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.970 
back in the 1960s we were told that the
tropical<00:00:03.419> oils<00:00:03.629> were<00:00:04.049> killing<00:00:04.500> us<00:00:04.620> so<00:00:04.799> there

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
tropical oils were killing us so there

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.530 
tropical oils were killing us so there
was<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.250> guy<00:00:05.580> Gantt<00:00:06.950> exquisite<00:00:08.090> to<00:00:09.090> replace

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
was this guy Gantt exquisite to replace

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.160 
was this guy Gantt exquisite to replace
the<00:00:10.050> palm<00:00:10.500> oil<00:00:10.950> shortening<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.719> used<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the palm oil shortening that we used to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.670 
the palm oil shortening that we used to
use<00:00:13.410> was<00:00:13.710> Crisco<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> various<00:00:15.389> other

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
use was Crisco and various other

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.620 
use was Crisco and various other
hydrogenated<00:00:16.680> vegetable<00:00:16.890> oils<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> don't

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
hydrogenated vegetable oils now I don't

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
hydrogenated vegetable oils now I don't
think<00:00:18.869> any<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.590> us<00:00:19.770> question<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> advice

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
think any of us question that advice

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.599 
think any of us question that advice
that<00:00:21.300> these<00:00:21.529> newer<00:00:22.529> fats<00:00:22.859> were<00:00:23.130> healthier

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that these newer fats were healthier

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
that these newer fats were healthier
than<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> evil<00:00:24.600> tropicals<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.830> why<00:00:26.460> would

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
than the evil tropicals and why would

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.870 
than the evil tropicals and why would
they<00:00:26.789> lie<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.960> eventually<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.310> truth<00:00:29.550> came

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
they lie but eventually the truth came

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
they lie but eventually the truth came
out<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> hydrogenation<00:00:31.410> process<00:00:31.590> which

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
out that the hydrogenation process which

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.690 
out that the hydrogenation process which
makes<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.300> oil<00:00:33.600> solid<00:00:34.290> created<00:00:35.070> trans<00:00:35.399> fats

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
makes the oil solid created trans fats

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.290 
makes the oil solid created trans fats
and<00:00:36.590> these<00:00:37.590> trans<00:00:37.950> fats<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.460> incorporated

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and these trans fats are incorporated

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
and these trans fats are incorporated
into<00:00:39.480> our<00:00:39.780> cell<00:00:40.200> membranes<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.579> don't

instead of soybeans and cotton seeds
which<00:02:20.069> as<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:21.060> said<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.569> require<00:02:21.989> high

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
which as it as I said they require high

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
which as it as I said they require high
temperature<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.069> pressure<00:02:23.340> followed<00:02:23.940> by<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
temperature and pressure followed by the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.199 
temperature and pressure followed by the
chemical<00:02:25.099> extraction<00:02:26.099> then<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
chemical extraction then they have a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
chemical extraction then they have a
foul<00:02:27.660> odor<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.980> rancidity<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.910> they

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
foul odor because of rancidity and they

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.880 
foul odor because of rancidity and they
require<00:02:31.099> deodorization<00:02:32.930> now<00:02:33.930> they<00:02:34.530> didn't<00:02:34.800> go

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
require deodorization now they didn't go

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.650 
require deodorization now they didn't go
through<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.250> deodorization<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.269> person

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
through this deodorization a person

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.479 
through this deodorization a person
wouldn't<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.170> within<00:02:37.410> 10<00:02:37.860> feet<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.190> this

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
wouldn't get within 10 feet of this

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.870 
wouldn't get within 10 feet of this
stuff<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.019> high<00:02:40.200> temperature<00:02:40.890> destroys

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
stuff now the high temperature destroys

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.820 
stuff now the high temperature destroys
vitamin<00:02:42.480> E<00:02:42.569> which<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.019> present<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> oil

vitamin E which is present in the oil

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830 
vitamin E which is present in the oil
naturally<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.150> might<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.540> otherwise

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
naturally and it might have otherwise

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.580 
naturally and it might have otherwise
prevented<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.830> oxidation<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.870> compensate

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
prevented this oxidation to compensate

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.100 
prevented this oxidation to compensate
for<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.860> loss<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.310> vitamin<00:02:50.730> E<00:02:50.850> they<00:02:51.390> add<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
for the loss of vitamin E they add the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.890 
for the loss of vitamin E they add the
potentially<00:02:52.680> toxic<00:02:53.390> BHT<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.769> bha<00:02:55.769> chemicals

potentially toxic BHT and bha chemicals

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.740 
potentially toxic BHT and bha chemicals
now<00:02:57.900> palm<00:02:58.319> oil<00:02:58.799> resists<00:02:59.569> oxidation<00:03:00.569> and

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
now palm oil resists oxidation and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.589 
now palm oil resists oxidation and
rancidity<00:03:01.370> naturally<00:03:02.370> due<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> vitamin<00:03:03.510> E

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and guess what these fatty acids just

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.819 
and guess what these fatty acids just
happen<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> be<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.549> same<00:03:20.940> ratio<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:22.680> our

acid<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:27.030> well<00:03:27.239> which<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.690> one<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230

acid as well which is one of the
essential<00:03:28.709> fatty<00:03:29.160> acids<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:30.209> must<00:03:30.480> get

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
essential fatty acids that we must get

from<00:03:30.959> our<00:03:31.079> diet<00:03:31.819> now<00:03:32.819> I<00:03:32.850> like<00:03:33.120> palm<00:03:33.390> oil<00:03:33.660> as<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
from our diet now I like palm oil as a

french fries without the guilt well I

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.430 
french fries without the guilt well I
eat<00:03:48.720> lots<00:03:49.079> of<00:03:49.380> french<00:03:49.590> fries<00:03:50.510> now<00:03:51.510> some<00:03:51.930> have
