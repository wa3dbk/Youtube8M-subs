the<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.289> thing<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> need<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.949> about

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the first thing you need to know about

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
the first thing you need to know about
the<00:00:32.579> southern<00:00:32.940> avenue<00:00:33.300> facility<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.079> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the southern avenue facility is that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.600 
the southern avenue facility is that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
some of it is condemned let's take a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
some of it is condemned let's take a
look<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> areas<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.170> aren't

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
look at some of the areas that aren't

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
look at some of the areas that aren't
condemned<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.879> parts<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.480> suffered<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
condemned these parts have suffered a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
condemned these parts have suffered a
great<00:00:43.200> deal<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.530> damage<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.460> water<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.210> from

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
great deal of damage from water and from

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170 
great deal of damage from water and from
time

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.080 

this<00:00:49.660> damage<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.320> not<00:00:50.650> just<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:51.190> storage<00:00:51.670> areas

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
this damage is not just in storage areas

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.130 
this damage is not just in storage areas
but<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.780> administrative<00:00:53.680> offices<00:00:54.250> as<00:00:54.460> well

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
but in administrative offices as well

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.479 
but in administrative offices as well
another<00:00:56.140> thing<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.530> consider<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.220> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
another thing to consider is that the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.250 
another thing to consider is that the
operation<00:00:58.000> at<00:00:58.300> southern<00:00:58.600> Avenue<00:00:59.020> has

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
operation at southern Avenue has

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.930

outgrown the useable part of the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.390 
outgrown the useable part of the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
building and some staff are housed in a

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.630 
building and some staff are housed in a
temporary<00:01:04.000> building<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.430> most

temporary building one of the most

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.340 
temporary building one of the most
important<00:01:07.240> things<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.690> understand<00:01:08.229> about

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
important things to understand about

those smaller buses anymore with the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.370 
those smaller buses anymore with the
larger<00:01:21.700> buses<00:01:22.149> there's<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.570> real<00:01:22.960> space

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
larger buses there's a real space

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.950 
larger buses there's a real space
problem<00:01:23.740> every<00:01:24.670> day<00:01:24.820> buses<00:01:25.270> must<00:01:25.509> come<00:01:25.750> into

problem every day buses must come into

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.780 
problem every day buses must come into
the<00:01:26.050> building<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> fare<00:01:27.190> boxes<00:01:27.610> can

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
the building so that the fare boxes can

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.570 
the building so that the fare boxes can
be<00:01:27.850> empty<00:01:28.380> ideally<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.560> fare<00:01:29.740> boxes<00:01:30.160> would<00:01:30.399> be

be empty ideally the fare boxes would be

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.310 
be empty ideally the fare boxes would be
emptied<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.330> bus<00:01:31.509> would<00:01:31.750> exit<00:01:32.050> without

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
emptied and the bus would exit without

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.340 
emptied and the bus would exit without
passing<00:01:32.800> through<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> maintenance<00:01:33.670> area<00:01:34.000> as

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
passing through the maintenance area as

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100 
passing through the maintenance area as
you<00:01:35.350> can<00:01:35.500> see<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:36.040> just<00:01:36.100> can't<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.119> done<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you can see it just can't be done the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.700 
you can see it just can't be done the
new<00:01:38.290> buses<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:39.399> don't<00:01:39.759> fit<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.050> what<00:01:41.259> happens

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
new buses just don't fit so what happens

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.800 
new buses just don't fit so what happens
is<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:41.920> every<00:01:42.490> bus<00:01:42.670> coming<00:01:43.090> off<00:01:43.360> its<00:01:43.570> run

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
is that every bus coming off its run

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.300 
is that every bus coming off its run
will<00:01:44.259> have<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.590> pass<00:01:44.800> through<00:01:45.190> the
