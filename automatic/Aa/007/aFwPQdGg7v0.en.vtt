 Hello, I'm Anna and this is mine 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 Channel did not think that you could be 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.540
 I thought it was pretty warm so 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.480
 channel on youtube started that one 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.789
 small intro intro video makes me 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 personally may be nice if that one 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 youtuber has done so and you almost 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 first learn a bit what is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 that actually a human and yes what has 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 the ford has its channel but i have 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 Pay attention to how difficult that is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.030
 to turn such a line I do not know 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 that we represent ourselves now I know 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 now how many times how many do I paint 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 I do not know how many times I do not know 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 I already started this video 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.270
 to kick it or it is already at the end 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.100
 kicked repeatedly and thought now must 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 you still cut and then from the computer 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.460
 sat thought never ever will that are so 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.800
 hard to turn from intro video was one 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 not at all with the situation 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.769
 is familiar to sit in front of the camera 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.570
 all in a room in front of the camera too 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 Do not sit and look in the lens 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.549
 in the picture exhibition I did that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 but you can easily do that if you can 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 almost in the corner of your eye what does that look like 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.229
 there's a look I'm not 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 in other words, this info has videos 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.630
 Turned 100,000 times and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.179
 now makes it concluded get if I 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.380

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.009

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.990

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.929
 a little bit of fashion, though 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.030
 I absolutely did not have to admit it 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.770
 i've learned by now 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.329
 I learned what I can wear with it 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.579
 do not look like gollum but I am 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.890
 not sure which tip to give 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.909

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.540
 my car sign that already the whole 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.880
 time does not flash effortfully and 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.990
