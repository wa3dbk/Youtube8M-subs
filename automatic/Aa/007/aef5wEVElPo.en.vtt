00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
do with movement I'm going to cover

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.920 
do with movement I'm going to cover
first<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.599> normal<00:00:31.500> movement<00:00:31.890> without<00:00:32.309> any

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
first of all normal movement without any

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.850 
first of all normal movement without any
special<00:00:34.610> attributes<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.730> fast<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.450> charge

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
special attributes like fast or charge

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.850 
special attributes like fast or charge
normal<00:00:37.860> movement<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> normal<00:00:38.610> squad<00:00:39.030> so

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
normal movement with a normal squad so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
normal movement with a normal squad so
these<00:00:40.860> grim<00:00:41.579> reapers<00:00:42.110> if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
these grim reapers if you look on the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.560 
these grim reapers if you look on the
card<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.100> they've<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> normal<00:00:45.210> movement

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
card here they've got a normal movement

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.470 
card here they've got a normal movement
of<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:47.010> ignoring<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> rest<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
of two so ignoring all the rest of the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
of two so ignoring all the rest of the
stats<00:00:48.719> normal<00:00:49.559> movements<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
stats normal movements of two what can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.540 
stats normal movements of two what can
they<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.600> can't<00:00:51.809> move<00:00:51.989> fast<00:00:52.550> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they do well they can't move fast so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
they do well they can't move fast so
they<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.789> only<00:00:53.969> move<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.620> at

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
they can only move to it can be one at

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.110 
they can only move to it can be one at
the<00:00:55.860> light<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.550> move<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> there

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the light so they can move to there

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
the light so they can move to there
there's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> standard<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:59.840> or<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.440> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there's a standard one or because it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
there's a standard one or because it's
the<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:01.739> diagonal<00:01:02.309> movement<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the first diagonal movement and this is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
the first diagonal movement and this is
the<00:01:04.559> thing<00:01:04.739> where<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> fellow<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> last<00:01:05.939> time

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the thing where I fellow the last time

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
the thing where I fellow the last time
and<00:01:06.420> other<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> net<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and other people have on the net the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
and other people have on the net the
first<00:01:08.490> diagonal<00:01:09.030> movement<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> first

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
first diagonal movement not the first

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
first diagonal movement not the first
movement<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:11.250> diagonal<00:01:11.580> movement

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
movement the first diagonal movement

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
movement the first diagonal movement
costs<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.840> normal<00:01:13.200> point<00:01:14.960> also<00:01:16.490> because

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
costs a normal point also because

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.780 
costs a normal point also because
they're<00:01:17.640> moving<00:01:17.880> around<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.180> building<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
they're moving around a building and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
they're moving around a building and
because<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> troops<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.200> was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
because the troops they can if it was

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
because the troops they can if it was
vehicles<00:01:22.790> normal<00:01:23.790> normal<00:01:24.090> vehicles<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.930> ones

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
vehicles normal normal vehicles not ones

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.140 
vehicles normal normal vehicles not ones
with<00:01:25.229> jump<00:01:25.470> options<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.369> normal<00:01:26.700> vehicles

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
with jump options but normal vehicles

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
with jump options but normal vehicles
are<00:01:27.450> called<00:01:27.689> jump<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.080> another<00:01:28.290> video<00:01:28.380> normal

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
are called jump on another video normal

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.050 
are called jump on another video normal
vehicles<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.409> movements

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
vehicles would have to do two movements

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.749 
vehicles would have to do two movements
troops<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.420> filter<00:01:33.810> around<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> corner

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
troops can filter around the corner

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.920 
troops can filter around the corner
using<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.090> movement<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> first

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
using one movement it's the first

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
using one movement it's the first
diagonal<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.710> made<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.159> their

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
diagonal move they made on their

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.810 
diagonal move they made on their
activation<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.560> costs<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.070> point<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> do

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
activation so it costs one point to do

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
activation so it costs one point to do
that<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.990> were<00:01:43.290> trying<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:44.009> another

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that if they were trying to do another

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
that if they were trying to do another
diagonal<00:01:44.549> movement<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.840> cost<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
diagonal movement that would cost an

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
diagonal movement that would cost an
additional<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.920> points<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.610> haven't

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
additional two points so they haven't

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
additional two points so they haven't
got<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.149> many<00:01:48.540> points<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.259> can't<00:01:49.530> do

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
got that many points so they can't do

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.160 
got that many points so they can't do
that<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.729> could<00:01:50.880> move<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.630> then

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that so they could move one and then

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
that so they could move one and then
they've<00:01:52.860> used<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> points<00:01:53.909> they

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
they've used one of the points they

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.899 
they've used one of the points they
could<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.600> shoot<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.530> laser<00:01:56.310> grand<00:01:56.610> ideas

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
could then shoot these laser grand ideas

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.120 
could then shoot these laser grand ideas
that<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.149> wished<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.740> or<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that they wished and or they could just

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
that they wished and or they could just
move<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.880> stay<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.689> could

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
move one and stay there or they could

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.800 
move one and stay there or they could
just<00:02:00.899> meet<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> square<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:03.659> that's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
just meet one to this square and that's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
just meet one to this square and that's
essentially<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.189> two<00:02:05.460> movement

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
essentially it with the two movement

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.949 
essentially it with the two movement
points<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.409> move<00:02:08.450> 12<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
points and they can move 12 in a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.559 
points and they can move 12 in a
straight<00:02:10.200> line<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.739> wished

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
straight line if they wished

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.080 
straight line if they wished
because<00:02:12.439> they've<00:02:12.590> got<00:02:12.739> two<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.879> one

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
because they've got two and can be one

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.119 
because they've got two and can be one
diagonal<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.140> straight<00:02:15.469> if<00:02:15.709> they<00:02:15.829> wanted

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
diagonal and one straight if they wanted

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.369 
diagonal and one straight if they wanted
to<00:02:16.189> so<00:02:16.670> they<00:02:16.790> could<00:02:16.969> end<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.209> there<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.629> the

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
to so they could end up there in the

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.690 
to so they could end up there in the
hardcover<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:21.069> because<00:02:22.069> it's<00:02:22.189> a<00:02:22.249> fierce<00:02:22.489> tag

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
hardcover and because it's a fierce tag

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
hardcover and because it's a fierce tag
along<00:02:22.849> as<00:02:22.939> one<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.719> normal<00:02:24.109> movement<00:02:24.469> is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
along as one and then normal movement is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.979 
along as one and then normal movement is
one<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.579> like<00:02:25.639> I<00:02:25.819> say<00:02:25.999> they<00:02:26.359> can't<00:02:26.629> move<00:02:26.810> to

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
one but like I say they can't move to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.330 
one but like I say they can't move to
that<00:02:27.109> they<00:02:27.349> started<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.889> move<00:02:28.099> there

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
that they started the move there

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.039 
that they started the move there
obviously<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.239> could<00:02:29.420> go<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.569> there<00:02:29.870> it's

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
obviously they could go to there it's

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.539 
obviously they could go to there it's
one<00:02:30.349> point<00:02:31.870> they<00:02:32.870> can't<00:02:33.139> move<00:02:33.680> second

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
one point they can't move second

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.330 
one point they can't move second
diagonal<00:02:34.730> now<00:02:35.209> they<00:02:35.269> can<00:02:35.510> any<00:02:35.719> of<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.959> troops

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
diagonal now they can any of the troops

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.399 
diagonal now they can any of the troops
or<00:02:37.340> tanks<00:02:37.849> or<00:02:37.969> anything<00:02:38.359> move<00:02:38.719> the<00:02:39.079> second

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
or tanks or anything move the second

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.170 
or tanks or anything move the second
diagonal<00:02:39.590> always<00:02:39.980> cost<00:02:40.250> two<00:02:40.700> points<00:02:41.060> after

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
diagonal always cost two points after

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.119 
diagonal always cost two points after
that<00:02:41.389> if<00:02:41.569> they've<00:02:41.780> got<00:02:41.930> those<00:02:42.109> points<00:02:42.859> left

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
that if they've got those points left

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.360 
that if they've got those points left
they<00:02:43.939> can<00:02:44.150> use<00:02:44.329> them<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.530> that's<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.980> standard

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
they can use them so that's a standard

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.119 
they can use them so that's a standard
movement<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.359> next<00:02:47.659> thing<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:49.120> they're<00:02:50.120> fast

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
movement the next thing is they're fast

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.909 
movement the next thing is they're fast
now<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.189> BBQ<00:02:52.760> squad<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.530> bazooka<00:02:54.530> joe<00:02:54.739> is

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
now the BBQ squad and bazooka joe is

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.349 
now the BBQ squad and bazooka joe is
always<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.609> team<00:02:55.849> as<00:02:55.969> normal<00:02:57.340> because

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
always at a team as normal because

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.839 
always at a team as normal because
bazooka<00:02:59.359> joe<00:02:59.510> hasn't<00:02:59.810> got<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.169> fast<00:03:00.379> option

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
bazooka joe hasn't got the fast option

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.729 
bazooka joe hasn't got the fast option
when<00:03:01.849> he's<00:03:01.969> attached<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.689> a<00:03:02.750> squad<00:03:03.169> he<00:03:03.500> gains

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
when he's attached to a squad he gains

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.349 
when he's attached to a squad he gains
their<00:03:03.980> attributes<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.699> their<00:03:04.879> their<00:03:04.909> main

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
their attributes and their their main

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.659 
their attributes and their their main
thing<00:03:05.659> is<00:03:05.689> they've<00:03:06.469> got<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:08.689> fast<00:03:09.019> option<00:03:09.669> he

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
thing is they've got the fast option he

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.069 
thing is they've got the fast option he
hasn't<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.129> get<00:03:13.400> combined<00:03:14.079> money

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
hasn't but they all get combined money

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.369 
hasn't but they all get combined money
when<00:03:15.439> he<00:03:15.590> joins<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.919> squad<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.970> fast<00:03:17.870> they've

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
when he joins the squad so fast they've

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.490 
when he joins the squad so fast they've
got<00:03:18.590> one<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:19.099> normal<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:19.609> pointers<00:03:19.970> normal

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
got one as normal one pointers normal

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.460 
got one as normal one pointers normal
fast<00:03:21.500> means<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.699> as<00:03:22.939> usual<00:03:23.689> with<00:03:23.989> any<00:03:24.109> squad

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
fast means that as usual with any squad

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.069 
fast means that as usual with any squad
they<00:03:24.829> could<00:03:25.069> run<00:03:26.769> 12<00:03:27.819> they<00:03:28.819> all<00:03:29.150> could<00:03:29.389> run<00:03:29.689> two

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
they could run 12 they all could run two

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.189 
they could run 12 they all could run two
squares<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.819> convert<00:03:31.819> their<00:03:32.060> shooting<00:03:32.509> face

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
squares and convert their shooting face

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.610 
squares and convert their shooting face
into<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:33.889> movement<00:03:34.189> point<00:03:34.810> as<00:03:35.810> as<00:03:36.079> kind<00:03:36.379> of<00:03:36.409> any

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
into a movement point as as kind of any

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.890 
into a movement point as as kind of any
squad<00:03:36.979> they<00:03:37.699> can<00:03:37.849> forego<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.419> shooting<00:03:38.720> phase

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
squad they can forego the shooting phase

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.379 
squad they can forego the shooting phase
and<00:03:39.199> move<00:03:39.439> instead<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.609> they've<00:03:40.759> run<00:03:41.030> two

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
and move instead so they've run two

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.909 
and move instead so they've run two
squares<00:03:42.669> they<00:03:43.669> could<00:03:43.939> run<00:03:44.470> actually<00:03:45.470> three

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
squares they could run actually three

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.069 
squares they could run actually three
squares<00:03:46.459> because<00:03:47.060> they've<00:03:47.449> got<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.750> fast

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
squares because they've got the fast

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.429 
squares because they've got the fast
option<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:48.919> that<00:03:49.819> was<00:03:49.939> in<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.090> straight<00:03:50.389> line

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
option if that was in a straight line

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.039 
option if that was in a straight line
they<00:03:51.439> could<00:03:51.620> do<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.949> or<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:53.629> they<00:03:53.750> could<00:03:53.930> end

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
they could do that or so they could end

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.999 
they could do that or so they could end
up<00:03:54.169> any<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:55.069> move<00:03:55.250> these<00:03:55.400> guys<00:03:55.669> they<00:03:55.879> could

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
up any just move these guys they could

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.740 
up any just move these guys they could
run<00:03:58.009> to<00:03:58.040> there<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:58.579> they<00:03:58.669> start<00:03:58.939> here<00:03:59.180> they

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
run to there so they start here they

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.869 
run to there so they start here they
could<00:03:59.900> go<00:04:00.019> one<00:04:00.199> two<00:04:01.099> there's<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.519> normal

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
could go one two there's a normal

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.969 
could go one two there's a normal
running<00:04:02.090> movement<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.719> they<00:04:03.469> get<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.859> their

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
running movement and they get to their

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.740 
running movement and they get to their
with<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.250> fast<00:04:04.519> option<00:04:04.939> but<00:04:05.449> they<00:04:05.540> can't

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
with the fast option but they can't

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.050 
with the fast option but they can't
shoot<00:04:06.019> then<00:04:06.229> they've<00:04:06.530> got<00:04:06.560> no<00:04:06.769> points<00:04:06.949> left<00:04:07.250> so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
shoot then they've got no points left so

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.699 
shoot then they've got no points left so
they<00:04:08.180> can<00:04:08.329> move<00:04:08.509> quite<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.810> distance<00:04:09.079> with<00:04:09.439> fast

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
they can move quite a distance with fast

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.349 
they can move quite a distance with fast
and<00:04:10.039> they<00:04:10.789> can<00:04:10.969> do<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.329> at<00:04:11.689> any<00:04:11.989> point<00:04:13.359> during

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
and they can do that at any point during

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.930 
and they can do that at any point during
that<00:04:14.509> activation<00:04:15.049> phase<00:04:15.789> another<00:04:16.789> example

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
that activation phase another example

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.040 
that activation phase another example
would<00:04:17.329> be<00:04:17.479> if<00:04:17.900> they<00:04:18.620> were<00:04:18.789> here

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.710 

they<00:04:23.050> could<00:04:23.760> because<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.000> first<00:04:25.030> agonal

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
they could because it's the first agonal

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.570 
they could because it's the first agonal
they<00:04:25.840> could<00:04:25.990> do<00:04:26.140> one<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:28.240> then<00:04:28.300> they<00:04:28.660> could<00:04:28.720> do

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
they could do one and then they could do

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.630 
they could do one and then they could do
two<00:04:30.580> three<00:04:31.210> if<00:04:31.840> they<00:04:32.050> were<00:04:32.110> running<00:04:32.640> because

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
two three if they were running because

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.300 
two three if they were running because
it's<00:04:34.000> only<00:04:34.180> one<00:04:34.360> diagonal<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.920> it's<00:04:36.040> one<00:04:36.280> two

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
it's only one diagonal so it's one two

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
it's only one diagonal so it's one two
three<00:04:37.150> if<00:04:37.360> they<00:04:37.540> wished<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.490> fast<00:04:40.450> option

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
three if they wished and fast option

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.270 
three if they wished and fast option
allows<00:04:41.320> them<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.530> do<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.830> obviously<00:04:41.950> when

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
allows them to do that obviously when

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.590 
allows them to do that obviously when
they<00:04:42.370> got<00:04:42.490> there<00:04:42.670> they<00:04:42.700> couldn't<00:04:43.150> shoot<00:04:43.390> they

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
they got there they couldn't shoot they

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.190 
they got there they couldn't shoot they
could<00:04:43.780> run<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.830> here<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.970> shoot<00:04:46.360> because

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
could run to here and shoot because

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.140 
could run to here and shoot because
they've<00:04:47.440> got<00:04:47.560> fast<00:04:47.830> we're<00:04:48.550> as<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:48.670> normal<00:04:48.730> squad

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
they've got fast we're as a normal squad

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.640 
they've got fast we're as a normal squad
wouldn't<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.510> gives<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.840> an<00:04:49.900> extra<00:04:50.200> movement

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
wouldn't it gives you an extra movement

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.300 
wouldn't it gives you an extra movement
and<00:04:51.040> that's<00:04:51.220> all<00:04:51.900> okay<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.860> that's<00:04:54.010> fast

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
and that's all okay so that's fast

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.700 
and that's all okay so that's fast

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
example as charged it's like fast but

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.580 
example as charged it's like fast but
you<00:05:16.240> can't<00:05:16.450> just<00:05:16.660> decide<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:16.960> use<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:17.410> when<00:05:17.560> you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
you can't just decide to use it when you

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.840 
you can't just decide to use it when you
want<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.950> you<00:05:18.100> can't<00:05:18.340> just<00:05:18.580> charge<00:05:19.450> up<00:05:20.850> an

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
want to you can't just charge up an

want to you can't just charge up an
extra<00:05:22.440> square<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.800> couldn't<00:05:24.100> it's<00:05:24.640> gotta

extra square so you couldn't it's gotta

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.940 
extra square so you couldn't it's gotta
stand<00:05:25.510> it's<00:05:25.780> got<00:05:27.150> 11<00:05:28.150> movement<00:05:28.870> point<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.860> you

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
stand it's got 11 movement point so you

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.560 
stand it's got 11 movement point so you
can't<00:05:30.160> just<00:05:30.400> decide<00:05:30.700> to<00:05:30.760> do<00:05:32.280> 12<00:05:33.280> as<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:34.150> normal
