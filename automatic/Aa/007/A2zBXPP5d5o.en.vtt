00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.910

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.070
 product that brought us the gustavo that 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.440

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.600
 pieces of paper although now you see it 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.610
 we also need the meat that goes to 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.590
 use I use in this case the spine 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.920
 but you can use it with chicken or 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.779
 veal what you want, the only thing 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.210
 let's do is put the fire and 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.210
 place our meat on the pieces of paper 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.640
 no oil is needed and they are made 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.620
 super fast that yes be very careful 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.340
 that they are not written because I was 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.230

 salad 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.140
