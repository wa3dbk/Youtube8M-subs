I'm going to be talking about the book
but<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.450> mean<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.899> isn't<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> book<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
but I mean this isn't really a book to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
but I mean this isn't really a book to
review<00:00:39.360> basically<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
review basically this is like a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.430 
review basically this is like a
children's<00:00:41.370> history<00:00:42.270> book<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> author<00:00:42.899> was

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
children's history book the author was

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.459 
children's history book the author was
working<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:43.980> his<00:00:44.640> doctorate<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.750> believe<00:00:46.079> his

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
working on his doctorate I believe his

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.350 
working on his doctorate I believe his
kids<00:00:46.770> were<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.190> oh<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
kids were like oh you know what are you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
kids were like oh you know what are you
spending<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.960> much<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.379> working<00:00:49.649> on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
spending your so much time working on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
spending your so much time working on
and<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.730> he<00:00:50.879> basically<00:00:51.030> explained<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.289> topic

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and so he basically explained the topic

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
and so he basically explained the topic
of<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.610> basic<00:00:53.820> terms<00:00:54.300> took

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
of it some really basic terms took

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
of it some really basic terms took
really<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.410> complex<00:00:55.860> ideas<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.399> history<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really like complex ideas of history and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
really like complex ideas of history and
simplified<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
simplified it down quite a bit so that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.560 
simplified it down quite a bit so that
way<00:00:59.070> his<00:00:59.250> kids<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.670> understand<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.420> then

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
way his kids could understand and then

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.439 
way his kids could understand and then
this<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.920> spurred<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> idea<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
this kind of spurred the idea of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
this kind of spurred the idea of
creating<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> children's<00:01:04.379> history<00:01:04.739> book<00:01:04.949> each

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
creating a children's history book each

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.590 
creating a children's history book each
chapter<00:01:05.909> goes<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.570> certain<00:01:07.320> era<00:01:08.010> or

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
chapter goes through a certain era or

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.910 
chapter goes through a certain era or
certain<00:01:09.600> topics<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> starts<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
certain topics and it starts at like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
certain topics and it starts at like
basically<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> beginning<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.909> man<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> goes

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
basically the beginning of man and goes

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
basically the beginning of man and goes
up<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.500> World<00:01:14.250> War<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.330> covers<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
up into World War two and it covers a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
up into World War two and it covers a
wide<00:01:15.780> variety<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> topics<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.189> there's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
wide variety of topics so there's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
wide variety of topics so there's
nothing<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.299> find<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> major

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
nothing that's a find you know major

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
nothing that's a find you know major
points<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.100> history<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.820> different

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
points in history and different

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.330 
points in history and different
religions<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> things<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.950> each

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
religions and things like that each

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.149 
religions and things like that each
chapter<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.960> only<00:01:25.110> ten<00:01:25.560> pages<00:01:25.770> long<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
chapter is maybe only ten pages long and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450 
chapter is maybe only ten pages long and
even<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.780> isn't<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.890> extensive

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
even that so it isn't like an extensive

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.960 
even that so it isn't like an extensive
history<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:30.299> anything<00:01:30.810> whatsoever<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.700> mean

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
history on anything whatsoever so I mean

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.810 
history on anything whatsoever so I mean
as<00:01:33.119> an<00:01:33.270> adult<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.250> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> already<00:01:35.460> feels

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
as an adult it kind of already feels

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
as an adult it kind of already feels
like<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> already<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.350> if

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
like things you already know because if

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
like things you already know because if
you've<00:01:37.829> had<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> take<00:01:38.400> history<00:01:38.640> classes<00:01:39.000> at

I felt like I was reading the book

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160 
I felt like I was reading the book
version<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.220> crash<00:02:08.459> course<00:02:08.599> because<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.020> way

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
version of crash course because the way

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.869 
version of crash course because the way
the<00:02:10.800> book<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> written<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.849> so

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
the book is written is so

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.300

in<00:02:13.209> formal<00:02:13.749> and<00:02:14.079> so<00:02:14.319> fun<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.859> kind<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.069> reminds

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
in formal and so fun it kind of reminds

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.459 
in formal and so fun it kind of reminds
me<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.609> way<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.030> John<00:02:16.629> Green<00:02:16.900> does<00:02:17.170> his

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
me of the way that John Green does his

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.890 
me of the way that John Green does his
world<00:02:17.739> history<00:02:18.219> crash<00:02:19.060> course<00:02:19.389> episodes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
world history crash course episodes

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.410 
world history crash course episodes
because<00:02:20.079> he's<00:02:20.469> so<00:02:20.739> informal<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.700> fun<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.299> he

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
because he's so informal and fun and he

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.270 
because he's so informal and fun and he
talks<00:02:22.870> about<00:02:22.989> complex<00:02:23.499> ideas<00:02:23.889> but<00:02:24.010> he<00:02:24.069> talks

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
talks about complex ideas but he talks

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.250 
talks about complex ideas but he talks
about<00:02:24.489> them<00:02:24.639> in<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.849> slightly<00:02:25.030> simpler<00:02:25.569> way<00:02:25.749> so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
about them in a slightly simpler way so

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.050 
about them in a slightly simpler way so
that<00:02:26.409> way<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.889> more<00:02:27.159> understandable<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that way it's more understandable and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.209 
that way it's more understandable and
relatable<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:29.019> book<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.469> written<00:02:29.769> in<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
relatable this book was written in the

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.580 
relatable this book was written in the
1930s<00:02:30.639> like<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.540> said<00:02:31.750> earlier<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.290> author's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
1930s like I said earlier the author's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.890 
1930s like I said earlier the author's
German<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.209> obviously<00:02:34.540> tell<00:02:34.689> that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
German so you can obviously tell that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
German so you can obviously tell that
it's<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.859> a<00:02:35.950> significant<00:02:36.489> portion<00:02:36.760> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it's kind of a significant portion of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.789 
it's kind of a significant portion of
time<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.659> book<00:02:37.810> was<00:02:37.989> originally<00:02:38.230> written<00:02:38.620> in

banded up moving to England it's such an
interesting<00:02:52.299> take<00:02:52.719> because<00:02:52.989> when<00:02:53.739> he<00:02:53.829> was

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:53.949 
interesting take because when he was

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.439 
interesting take because when he was
writing<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.310> book<00:02:54.489> he<00:02:54.639> had<00:02:54.730> no<00:02:54.849> idea<00:02:55.120> what<00:02:55.359> he

writing this book he had no idea what he
was<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:55.719> on<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.930> cusp<00:02:56.139> of<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.709> only

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
was right on the cusp of and it's only

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.619 
was right on the cusp of and it's only
looking<00:02:57.189> back<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.639> you<00:02:57.730> realize<00:02:58.150> kind<00:02:58.449> of

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
looking back that you realize kind of

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.050 
looking back that you realize kind of
the<00:02:58.870> significance<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.799> it<00:02:59.949> and<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.849> time

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
the significance of it and the time

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.429 
the significance of it and the time
period<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.389> he's<00:03:01.569> writing<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.989> like<00:03:02.260> it's

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
period that he's writing in like it's

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.899 
period that he's writing in like it's
really<00:03:02.680> funny<00:03:02.889> reading<00:03:03.129> all<00:03:03.400> these<00:03:03.639> things

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
gonna happen in history because it

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.500 
gonna happen in history because it

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
idea that something bigger was right

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.399 
idea that something bigger was right
along<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.489> way<00:03:18.639> like<00:03:19.120> within<00:03:19.419> a<00:03:19.750> year<00:03:20.109> or<00:03:20.199> so

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
along the way like within a year or so

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.020 
along the way like within a year or so
and<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.979> think<00:03:21.129> he<00:03:21.340> talks<00:03:21.549> about<00:03:21.609> in<00:03:21.909> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.610 
and I think he talks about in the
chapter<00:03:22.060> about<00:03:22.509> World<00:03:22.780> War<00:03:22.840> two<00:03:23.079> is<00:03:23.229> about<00:03:23.439> how

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
chapter about World War two is about how

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.849 
chapter about World War two is about how

he realized looking back how some of the
things<00:03:26.919> and<00:03:27.519> some<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.209> his<00:03:28.299> perceptions<00:03:28.870> were

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
things and some of his perceptions were

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.649 
things and some of his perceptions were
oh<00:03:29.409> it<00:03:30.189> wasn't<00:03:30.579> completely<00:03:31.060> his<00:03:31.299> fault<00:03:31.509> it's

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
oh it wasn't completely his fault it's

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.240 
oh it wasn't completely his fault it's
the<00:03:31.870> way<00:03:31.989> things<00:03:32.229> are<00:03:32.349> being<00:03:32.470> reported<00:03:32.889> and

the<00:03:50.889> idea<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.519> reading<00:03:51.759> about<00:03:52.030> history

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
the idea of reading about history

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.629 
the idea of reading about history
especially<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.290> while<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.949> happening<00:03:54.129> is

especially like while it's happening is

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.390 
especially like while it's happening is
such<00:03:55.560> interesting<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.739> complex<00:03:57.069> thing

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
such interesting and complex thing

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.610 
such interesting and complex thing
that's<00:03:57.639> something<00:03:57.969> that<00:03:58.349> journalists<00:03:59.349> kind

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
that's something that journalists kind

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.530 
that's something that journalists kind
of<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.889> to<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.219> and<00:04:00.579> when<00:04:00.790> people<00:04:01.120> write<00:04:01.329> you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
of have to do and when people write you

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.369 
kind of doing it as well it's really
difficult<00:04:06.669> to<00:04:07.239> be<00:04:07.329> able<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.689> know<00:04:07.870> the
