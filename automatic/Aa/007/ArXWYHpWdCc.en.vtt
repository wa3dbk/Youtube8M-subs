00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.350
 the team of my laws as they walk I am 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.860
 talent and today I bring you the top 3 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.720
 the best races of the week and this 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.059
 time is different is no longer the top without 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.830
 because he honestly had a problem and 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.900
 instead of putting two races that do not 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.539
 They are very good I decided to get straight 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.670
 the three the best three races of the 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.320
 week they will be here so they must 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.939
 stay because the one that is in first 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.010
 place is something that has never been seen in 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.010
 the top and they may be interested in the mission 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.809
 or 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.980
 very good starting at the top number 3 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 we are going to have this race that is going to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 call hot wheels and the whole race is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 develops in a circuit where they are 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 here the containers the factories good 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.269
 are not factories know the commission to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 pier east but the truth is that 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.500
 is very very good and very competitive is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.540
 what I liked most about this one of the play 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.909
 of the four players that is the most 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.400
 unfortunately to a jungle still 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.930
 sorry is going to be very very competitive like 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 can see there is giving me some monkeys 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 cool but good does not matter I'm 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.930
 bryant exceeded put and I recomposed myself 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 but the good thing about this race is that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 has some highs that are very good 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 strategically placed and it's going to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 make see these effects and tires very 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 good there you can see how that black me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.929
 crashes through the air of the damn and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.729
 totally out of control and more or less 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.380
 live to lose the race in fact this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.810
 metro race already too high are going to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.880
 watch 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.290
 but good still going around 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 let's keep moving forward we're going to 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.070
 find with the second jump that I eat 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 can see here a tree turns me on 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.410
 trolling the damn race back to 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.150
 touch the back 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.730
 but good once we go down here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.110
 from the Swedish factory simply 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.670
 we are going to have to continue giving the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.650
 circuit and once we go 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.600
 completing the laps we will get to 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.510
 what is supposed to be the hot part 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.760
 wheels that is this plant that is a 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.590
 person is a wall of integrates 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.570
 antigravity and they have to know how to do it 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.880
 I unfortunately went over speed 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.560
 and how can you see your site but it's 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.780
 so that you do not kill yourself then 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.000
 Here, I regué because I have 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 in between and does not since there was a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.959
 alley cited in the middle so like 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.410
 can see here I grab the ramp 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.180
 unfortunately he did not grab it with 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.310
 enough relationship to you as you can see 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 did not achieve anything so do not worry 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 just remove the check point and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.070
 now we are going to catch perfect this 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.690
 ramp already I think here in fact I 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.670
 screw back if a list is like this 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.470
 it's like this it's back to trojans and good 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.209
 already after that we will continue to give 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 you turn the circuit I tell you that it is very 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.700
 pro very competitive and see in that I was 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.370
 passed the stick checkpoint and that it 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.030
 the damn checkpoint happened to me 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.819
 I was able to reach the goal 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.500
 they give him where I stay exactly like 2 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.620
 seconds 3 seconds than if it had been 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.230
 by that point to control 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.090
 but good friends is out number 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.860
 three now we go with the number two that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.659
 it's also great that in fact 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.909
 I was going to have a very serious problem 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.040
 because I think it would have been better 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.280
 the number does not do it I do not know let's see 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.349
 this race is called dies hard good 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.329
 it's not called dies hard it's called the heart 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.549
 number 2 and the truth is that he was very 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.280
 very good has some checkpoints 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.650
 very fast has the whole career it 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.659
 it's very fast and outside of that 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.190
 it has a high degrees late is very 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.440
 good here is the first one that like 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.180
 can see is a ramp that we have to 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.980
 to be there as the entity without 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.930
 back to get a good grip gravity 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 of the air that we do not fall and will arrive 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.140
 and the containers once of the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.599
 containers down here for the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.280
 highway and we will continue going as 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.079
 can see here is the second jump 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.629
 too pro because they do not love these 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.670
 loads that we put high so very well 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.890
 us to races won by in jumps 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.680
 propose jumps but these are fine 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.450
 thought so good once 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.099
 let's go on here for the race we're going to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.270
 have to keep moving forward and here comes 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.550
 a part where 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.230
 a few hours or so and do this 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.700
 ramp that is a bit complicated the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.680
 true because many winds a lot 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.560
 speed and may not grip the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.210
 curve and here is a very my friends part 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.680
 every time we still go as they can 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.810
 see here I come fighting with the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.820
 ghost this colleagues to go with him to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.650
 see gasparín so here I came 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780
 hitting with gasparín we came here the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.610
 two seeing what would happen the ramp and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.130
 like him now can not pass him either 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.320
 damn it so that part can be 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.060
 very train if they put it with collision because 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.459
 many can be seen crashing since 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.530
 grab the ramp and here I cut him but 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.540
 there we were already like a minute and a half 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.470
 to see who happened with the medium and 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.690
 was almost all and the only thing that there is 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.180
 do now is to go on the pier 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.460
 this sorry that already once arriving here 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.960
 to the house of the docks and all that all 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.210
 you had to go through the part of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.310
 outside from is puig speech we are going to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.260
 grab this other very very epic jump 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.750
 more congratulations to the parking lot 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.030
 from the beach and as you can see there 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.010
 very bad has fallen super good would have 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.620
 won the damn gas entirely won me 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.199
 and that was number 2 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.229
 in the new 1 we will have this other 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.729
 which, as I say, is something different and 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.229
 I had never seen it and that's why it's in 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.290
 the number 1 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.760
 this race is called they did not know a 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.410
 damn it but good let's call him 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.910
 lion king 'a friend told me that if I 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.729
 we called king lion 'then I'm going to 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.410
 explain why so good there bank 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.729
 I stop because an ox falls to the bottom 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.590
 I do not know if they see that they are going to see the week 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.600
 of insurance and return laws and leaves 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.130
 falling I go to the bottom and good after 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.690
 that we made fun of, said we're going to 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.850
 do it and the truth is that this race 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.550
 super good although being sincere 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.050
 afterwards I already like that I did not like the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.460
 first time I loved it because it was very 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.810
 difficult this part that is also that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.970
 here I do the first one was very 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.830
 difficult for me but today grabbing him the 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.630
 trick the pass is very easy 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.850
 this second jump that comes here is 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.440
 incredibly epic in a song because 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.449
 You have to arrive with chances to 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.699
 reach this ceiling and once you get 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.800
 here you will see how almost metro makes you 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.060
 bus but this one in this race was 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.820
 my side he says not worth it is the most 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.810
 I hope home grab here for a lot 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.240
 luck and control and I could 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.409
 so well once we go down here to 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.749
 the part of the water 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.089
 construction we will continue in as 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.039
 a coin of another sad and go to 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:06.499
 direct to other highs very well peak that 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.239
 receives the other saints the only thing 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.129
 we will have to do now is to calculate 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:11.779
 very well the seriousness of having for 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.729
 to be without proposals without giving 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.790
 sorry to be able to get here at 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.740
 pavement with a lot 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.270
 let's explode because if we explode let's 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.449
 have to be from above we can 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.550
 lose much more 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.020
 after that we're going to go through the tracks and 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.550
 reaching the part of the avenue 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.379
 main let's make this jump 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.939
 own and once being this jump then 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.379
 let's go around to finish the 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.289
 another jump and it will be over this 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.689
 career so you tell me which one 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.879
 liked it better if it is or the 2 for me 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.800
 thinking about it well I think I already regret 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.409
 the number 2 should be a number 1 and 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.659
 it's at number 2 but well I do not know 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.159
 Once you play it and you love it 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.599
 even more if these jumps are okay 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.270
 they have many tall and incredible peaks 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.099
 but good you tell me the now you 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.509
 I'm going to say fast that it's not the top 5 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.639
 because my captor is having 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.319
 problems are the videos are 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.330
 reusing badly or something is happening 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.580
 as you can see some clips to payán 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.469
 then I was fed up and decided
