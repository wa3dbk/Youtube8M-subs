but with some interesting twists to it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
but with some interesting twists to it
because<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> custom<00:00:34.200> map<00:00:34.350> loads<00:00:34.620> of

is<00:01:00.539> by<00:01:00.690> far<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.020> favorite<00:01:01.410> lips<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.890> I've<00:01:01.980> ever

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
is by far my favorite lips but I've ever

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.860 
is by far my favorite lips but I've ever
done<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.940> took<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> long<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.629> upload

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
done so it took a long time to upload

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
done so it took a long time to upload
and<00:01:04.260> render<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.619> everything<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and render and everything but I think it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.280 
and render and everything but I think it
was<00:01:05.850> worth<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> few<00:01:06.810> guys<00:01:06.960> who<00:01:06.990> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
was worth it and few guys who do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.570 
was worth it and few guys who do
actually<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.860> check<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.400> think

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
actually go and check that out I think

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
actually go and check that out I think
you're<00:01:08.939> where<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.659> enjoy<00:01:09.869> watching<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.530> it
