agricultural which is naturally

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.029 
agricultural which is naturally
appropriate<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.830> where

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
appropriate because it's that's where

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.820 
appropriate because it's that's where
they<00:00:29.130> meant<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.460> down<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> farm<00:00:30.179> but
