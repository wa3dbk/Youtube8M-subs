00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:09.879
 I met Henry when I was six years old. 

00:00:11.287 --> 00:00:12.287
 I still remember the day we met. 

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:13.890
 I travel through time and space 

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.098
 In the future, I will turn friends into friends. 

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:18.537
 At that time you were slim 

00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:20.712
 There is no such thing as time and space travel. 

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:23.027
 If you are in this station for a while, you will see me disappear. 

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.835
 At that moment, he was still in front of my eyes, he disappeared. 

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.306
 I have been waiting for Henry all my life. 

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:35.479
 It's you 

00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:38.237
 I remember the moment you come to me every time. 

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.061
 You tell me that you often go back to the same place 

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:45.194
 Yeah, like gravity, always pulling me 

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:46.722
 I am the traction 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:51.795
 This is very strange. 

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:53.736
 No, it is amazing 

00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.241
 I no longer feel lonely 

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.546
 Will you marry me? 

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.001
 Unwilling 

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:05.169
 I'm just kidding... 

00:01:07.012 --> 00:01:08.012
 Of course willing 

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:17.374
 We named her "Aiba" 

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.005
 Have you seen her? 

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:19.053
 She is very pretty 

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.047
 father 

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.467
 I travel through time and space and cannot control 

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.187
 Suddenly, I hope that I don’t want this. 

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.002
 You're back 

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.849
 Did I miss Christmas? 

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.201
 What do you want to talk about? 

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.471
 How bad is it to wait for you? 

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:46.282
 Adapted from the best-selling novels worldwide 

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.451
 Do you want to have it once... Is normal life wrong? 

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:53.668
 Do you think that I want this kind of life... My husband is missing without warning? 

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.254
 Who would be willing to do this? 

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:56.082
 - You can choose - I never have to choose 

00:01:58.857 --> 00:01:59.857
 I don’t want to wait for my life. 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.799

 Time traveler's wife 

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.376
 I should leave. 

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.431
