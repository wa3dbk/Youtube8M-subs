00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.030 
what not like magic all that stuff would
somehow<00:01:01.239> work<00:01:01.750> but<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.320> would<00:01:02.500> still<00:01:02.710> have<00:01:02.739> to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
somehow work but you would still have to

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.280 
somehow work but you would still have to
do<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.190> lot<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.489> scrubbing<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.629> get<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.050> brake

pretty bad so I'm going to show you guys
how<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.880> one<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.180> these<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.380> get

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
how to use one of these that you can get

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.570 
how to use one of these that you can get
for<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.770> buck<00:01:17.950> apiece

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
for a buck apiece

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.440 
for a buck apiece
to<00:01:19.509> get<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:19.840> off<00:01:20.050> without<00:01:20.830> scrubbing<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
to get that off without scrubbing you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.510 
to get that off without scrubbing you
might<00:01:22.660> have<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.930> do<00:01:23.080> just<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.680> tiny<00:01:24.130> bit<00:01:24.369> of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
might have to do just a tiny bit of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.990 
might have to do just a tiny bit of
scrubbing<00:01:24.790> but<00:01:25.240> that's<00:01:25.390> about<00:01:25.570> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
scrubbing but that's about it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.850 
scrubbing but that's about it
okay<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:29.290> shake<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.619> spray<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.380> don't

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
okay just shake you spray and you don't

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.139 
okay just shake you spray and you don't
have<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.100> worry<00:01:33.280> about<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.610> getting<00:01:33.729> them<00:01:33.940> on

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
have to worry about it getting them on

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.700 
have to worry about it getting them on
the<00:01:34.390> thighs<00:01:34.600> not<00:01:35.050> going<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.259> hurt<00:01:35.350> anything

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the thighs not going to hurt anything

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:50.240 
the thighs not going to hurt anything
and<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:48.549> there's<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.000> lot<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.330> guys<00:01:49.540> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and I know there's a lot of guys that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.980 
and I know there's a lot of guys that
are<00:01:51.250> going<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.729> against<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.570> technique

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
are going to be against this technique

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.180 
are going to be against this technique
saying<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.040> my<00:01:54.390> heard<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.630> rim<00:01:55.869> or

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
saying that it is my heard the rim or

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.460 
saying that it is my heard the rim or
heard<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.369> tire<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.940> that's<00:01:58.210> not<00:01:58.360> true<00:01:58.540> I've

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
heard the tire but that's not true I've

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.179 
heard the tire but that's not true I've
been<00:01:59.680> using<00:01:59.860> this<00:02:00.220> same<00:02:00.970> technique<00:02:01.450> for<00:02:02.189> years

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
been using this same technique for years

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.420 
been using this same technique for years
and<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.729> never<00:02:03.760> did<00:02:04.119> anything

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.410 

spit<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.270> let<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:07.990> sit<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
spit on let it sit there and then it

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.290 
spit on let it sit there and then it
slowly<00:02:13.750> start<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> come<00:02:14.500> off<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.880> does<00:02:16.060> come

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
slowly start to come off as it does come

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.820 
slowly start to come off as it does come
off<00:02:16.330> you're<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> rinse<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.380> off<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
off you're going to rinse it off and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.530 
off you're going to rinse it off and
just<00:02:17.860> keep<00:02:18.160> doing<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.520> same<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:22.330> guys

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
just keep doing the same thing okay guys

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.780 
just keep doing the same thing okay guys
it's<00:02:22.870> only<00:02:22.990> been<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.290> five<00:02:24.070> minutes<00:02:24.340> I'm

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
it's only been like five minutes I'm

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.510 
it's only been like five minutes I'm
going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> use<00:02:25.210> one<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.390> these<00:02:25.540> cup<00:02:25.870> pads<00:02:26.520> just

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
going to use one of these cup pads just

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.730 
going to use one of these cup pads just
to<00:02:27.730> come<00:02:27.940> stop<00:02:28.570> brushing<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.080> off<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.620> then

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
to come stop brushing this off and then

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.760 
to come stop brushing this off and then
I'm<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.100> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> hold<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.700> off<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.770> that's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
I'm just going to hold it off so that's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.470 
I'm just going to hold it off so that's
what<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.100> going<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.340> like

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.400 

this<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.600> brawny<00:02:42.700> one<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> worst<00:02:44.660> rooms<00:02:45.140> I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
this is brawny one of the worst rooms I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.080 
this is brawny one of the worst rooms I
really<00:02:45.740> had<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.020> while<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.370> might<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
really had in a while so I might have to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.270 
really had in a while so I might have to
repeat<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.600> process<00:02:50.870> two<00:02:51.680> or<00:02:51.710> three<00:02:51.950> times

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
repeat this process two or three times

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.500 
repeat this process two or three times
but<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.810> definitely<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> lot<00:02:54.680> cheaper<00:02:54.980> than

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
but it's definitely a lot cheaper than

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.580 
but it's definitely a lot cheaper than
most<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> stuff<00:02:56.990> you<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.170> get<00:02:57.380> at

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
most of the stuff you can get at

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:30.020 
most of the stuff you can get at
autozone<00:02:58.570> so<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:01.010> team

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.150
