you want to do is directly jump just on
top<00:00:33.580> of<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:33.820> area<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.180> I<00:00:34.330> do<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:34.960> what<00:00:35.050> you

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
and just jump on top of this and just

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.869 
and just jump on top of this and just
keep<00:00:41.260> doing<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.620> repeatedly<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.610> get<00:00:42.760> to

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
keep doing that repeatedly so you get to

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.270 
keep doing that repeatedly so you get to
the<00:00:42.970> area<00:00:43.269> where<00:00:43.449> I<00:00:43.510> do<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:44.170> that's<00:00:45.070> simply

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
the area where I do and that's simply

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.979 
the area where I do and that's simply
just<00:00:45.699> how<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.909> do<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.269> glitch<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.780> that's

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
just how you do the glitch and that's

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.140 
just how you do the glitch and that's
just<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.290> first<00:00:47.320> part<00:00:47.680> on<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.580> second<00:00:48.909> part

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
just the first part on the second part

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.609 
just the first part on the second part
is<00:00:49.360> relatively<00:00:50.320> more<00:00:50.769> difficult<00:00:51.339> um<00:00:52.049> so<00:00:53.049> when

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
is relatively more difficult um so when

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.170 
is relatively more difficult um so when
i<00:00:53.650> actually<00:00:53.979> get<00:00:54.250> there<00:00:54.460> also<00:00:54.729> there<00:00:54.850> actually

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
i actually get there also there actually

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.700 
i actually get there also there actually
is<00:00:55.330> a<00:00:55.360> second<00:00:55.839> way<00:00:55.869> to<00:00:55.989> get<00:00:56.199> on<00:00:56.320> top<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.559> this

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
is a second way to get on top of this

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.259 
is a second way to get on top of this
that<00:00:57.040> I<00:00:57.070> discovered<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.670> can<00:00:57.820> get<00:00:57.970> on<00:00:58.059> top<00:00:58.239> of

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
that I discovered you can get on top of

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.869 
that I discovered you can get on top of
this<00:00:58.390> truck<00:00:58.720> and<00:00:58.900> then<00:00:59.199> directly<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.979> jump<00:01:00.699> or

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
this truck and then directly a jump or

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.910 
this truck and then directly a jump or
glide<00:01:00.909> onto<00:01:01.540> this<00:01:01.839> location<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.500> do<00:01:02.589> jump

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
glide onto this location that I do jump

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.189 
glide onto this location that I do jump
on<00:01:03.040> to<00:01:03.220> hear<00:01:03.580> this<00:01:04.269> little<00:01:04.540> ledge<00:01:04.720> right<00:01:04.960> here

shoot it then you want to jump directly

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.359 
shoot it then you want to jump directly
on<00:01:08.080> top<00:01:08.229> of<00:01:08.409> here<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.740> then<00:01:08.950> there<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.220> go

then run around this corner you be able

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.289 
then run around this corner you be able
to<00:01:27.219> just<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.429> walk<00:01:27.729> through<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:28.179> what

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
to just to walk through and then what

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.609 
to just to walk through and then what
you<00:01:28.390> want<00:01:28.539> to<00:01:28.570> do<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.780> walk<00:01:28.960> close<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.469> edge

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
you want to do is walk close to the edge

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.169 
you want to do is walk close to the edge
and<00:01:29.859> boost<00:01:30.280> yourself<00:01:30.429> so<00:01:30.789> you<00:01:30.850> don't<00:01:30.880> fall<00:01:31.119> off

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
and boost yourself so you don't fall off

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.060 
and boost yourself so you don't fall off
the<00:01:31.240> edge<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.630> boost<00:01:32.229> yourself<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.829> left

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the edge and boost yourself to the left
