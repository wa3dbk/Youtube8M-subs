actually machine the head from the piece

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.349 
actually machine the head from the piece
of<00:00:20.400> wax<00:00:21.830> first<00:00:22.830> start<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.220> by<00:00:23.939> cutting<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
of wax first start out by cutting a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.560 
of wax first start out by cutting a
piece<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.810> wax<00:00:25.019> off<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.590> inches<00:00:25.619> long

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510 

next<00:00:30.570> insert<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.140> wax<00:00:31.380> into<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.040> bar<00:00:32.219> clamp

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
next insert that wax into the bar clamp

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
next insert that wax into the bar clamp
fixture<00:00:34.700> jog<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.880> end<00:00:36.090> mills<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> x

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
fixture jog your end mills so that the x

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
fixture jog your end mills so that the x
axis<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.489> directly<00:00:39.059> over<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> wax

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
axis is directly over the end of the wax

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.979 
axis is directly over the end of the wax
as<00:00:40.440> shown<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:42.739> go<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:43.890> machine<00:00:44.340> wizard<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
as shown then go into machine wizard and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.229 
as shown then go into machine wizard and
zero<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> x<00:00:46.440> axis<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.460> pressing<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> set

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
zero the x axis out by pressing the set

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
zero the x axis out by pressing the set
button<00:00:48.510> next<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> fixture<00:00:50.070> offset<00:00:50.489> you're

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
button next to the fixture offset you're

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
button next to the fixture offset you're
using<00:00:54.020> then<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> jog<00:00:55.860> tab<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.660> using

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
using then go to the jog tab and using

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.040 
using then go to the jog tab and using
the<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> section<00:00:58.969> move<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.210> x<00:01:00.359> axis<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the go to section move the x axis to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.479 
the go to section move the x axis to
negative<00:01:01.469> 27<00:01:02.449> millimeters<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we're<00:01:05.369> going

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
negative 27 millimeters so we're going

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
negative 27 millimeters so we're going
to<00:01:05.610> move<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> x<00:01:06.119> axis<00:01:06.630> twenty<00:01:06.990> seven

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to move the x axis twenty seven

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
to move the x axis twenty seven
millimeters<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> left<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
millimeters over to the left this is so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.690 
millimeters over to the left this is so
that<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.409> cut<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> core<00:01:14.159> program

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that we can cut out the core program

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
that we can cut out the core program
right<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.229> our

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
right here and this is going to be our

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.969 
right here and this is going to be our
zero<00:01:16.680> point<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.150> why<00:01:18.619> inside<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> proto

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
zero point this is why inside a proto

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.480 
zero point this is why inside a proto
Izzard<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> top<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.409> our<00:01:22.530> head<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Izzard we set up the top of our head to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969 
Izzard we set up the top of our head to
always<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.000> shifted<00:01:24.450> 25<00:01:24.930> millimeters<00:01:25.530> over

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
always be shifted 25 millimeters over

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
always be shifted 25 millimeters over
and<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.060> into<00:01:30.270> machine<00:01:30.630> wizard
