screamer so why not down early on and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.990 
screamer so why not down early on and
man<00:01:15.200> United<00:01:15.500> were<00:01:15.619> really<00:01:16.070> on<00:01:16.250> top<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.700> me<00:01:16.880> in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
man United were really on top of me in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600 
man United were really on top of me in
this<00:01:17.450> first<00:01:17.630> stuff<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.140> was<00:01:18.350> struggling<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.190> to

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
this first stuff I was struggling to to

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.730 
this first stuff I was struggling to to
keep<00:01:19.820> them<00:01:20.180> out<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.479> my<00:01:20.510> half<00:01:20.960> because<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.500> just

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
keep them out on my half because I just

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.380 
keep them out on my half because I just
could<00:01:21.950> not<00:01:22.130> get<00:01:22.340> any<00:01:22.580> possession<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.240> ball

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
could not get any possession of the ball

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.120 
could not get any possession of the ball
they<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:23.810> passed<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.290> around<00:01:24.380> really<00:01:24.920> really

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
they just passed it around really really

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.039 
they just passed it around really really
nicely<00:01:25.310> exploiting<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.360> flanks<00:01:26.720> whenever<00:01:26.990> I

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
nicely exploiting the flanks whenever I

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.810 
nicely exploiting the flanks whenever I
tried<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.500> go<00:01:27.650> narrow<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> defense<00:01:28.580> and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
tried to go narrow with the defense and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.480 
tried to go narrow with the defense and
then<00:01:29.240> whenever<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.689> kind<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.530> opened<00:01:31.250> up<00:01:31.369> my

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
then whenever I kind of opened up my

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.649 
then whenever I kind of opened up my
defense<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:31.970> bit<00:01:32.210> they<00:01:32.330> were<00:01:32.450> looking

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
defense a little bit they were looking

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.240
