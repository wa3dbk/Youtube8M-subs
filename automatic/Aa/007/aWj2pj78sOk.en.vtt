00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hi everyone, the name is jairo and this is a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:15.509
 ram boat having second model is 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 for anyone, it's 650 books more 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.820
 how can you see that you can 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 to fish in a quiet way he does not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 more than two people and I have to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.580
 this video by the following they only see the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 even with this adaptation I went here 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.960
 I did the same as the support 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.530
 to put is the two seats in the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.530
 report was made 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.739
 I'm going to take a general step here so that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 You can see I had done another 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.020
 video in which I left already from the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 principle when we started to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.869
 work both as the the wood iti 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 by themselves but only here in SÃ£o Paulo and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.510
 in the chamber I lost so I'm doing 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 a new video and showing it already ready 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.350
 so is the boat is already full 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 inflated and I'll leave this way to see 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.880
 like how he behaves nor 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 it will not show if it's nothing outside who 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 its SÃ£o Paulo over the weekend 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.750
 Now we intend to take this 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 boat to see his performance on a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.850
 dam in avare 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.159
 so here goes a fisherman fisherman 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 another fisherman and the last moment using 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.540
 the electric motor in the phantom is here and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.540
 made a support to put sonae 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 rise 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.690
 the bid is that in general in the neighborhood itself 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:30.790
 Then he said here to say that he is to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:39.459
 four people how are you going to get 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.350
 that up there the person 650 pounds but at 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.610
 that you can see here look does not have 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.930
 condition of putting four people here 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 in the neighborhood it snows in a maximum of two 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.799
 this tail was bought on this stand 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.900
 for the tail was bought but it is 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.130
 can do in it is possible to do 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:11.590
 there is the same, right? 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:13.450
 so there is no problem here in 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.790
 background looks like aluminum 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.860
 but for the truth, what was done 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.970
 following is the same pins in the law is 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.510
 construction 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.400
 Madeirite, right? 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.519
 she was coated with that is blanket 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.980
 asphalt blanket that goes home right 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:38.709
 personal powder to make jewelry fence then 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.019
 Two armchairs, right? 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.579
 This one was also manufactured here. 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:47.530
 brown and white 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.859
 industrial even if we acquired from 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.450
 industrial jewelry model 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:56.130
 So is it possible with a chair 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.370
 common you had a broken chair 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.609
 also make a rotating center 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.260
 folks 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:09.400
 For now it's just and I thought that people 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:14.380
 still going there the water is pro rio 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:19.690
 We are going to give a link to the ii and vai 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.020
 also do the same test there 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.250
 waters do not see how it behaves 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.250
