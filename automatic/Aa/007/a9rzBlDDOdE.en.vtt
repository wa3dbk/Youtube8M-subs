period to help stretch out the muscle in
my<00:01:41.410> back<00:01:41.590> which<00:01:42.430> will<00:01:42.640> allow<00:01:42.729> more<00:01:43.119> blood

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
my back which will allow more blood

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.859 
my back which will allow more blood
carrying<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.530> oxygen<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:46.000> nutrition<00:01:46.479> to

carrying the oxygen and the nutrition to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.540 
carrying the oxygen and the nutrition to
the<00:01:46.990> muscle<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.500> allow<00:01:47.619> me<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.800> work<00:01:48.070> stronger

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
the muscle to allow me to work stronger

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.550 
the muscle to allow me to work stronger
and<00:01:48.760> harder

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:19.960 

get<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.770> down<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.159> my<00:01:56.250> second<00:01:56.729> warm-up<00:01:57.270> set

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.970 

so<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> saw<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.569> set<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.200> had<00:02:22.470> one<00:02:22.739> foot

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so you saw on that set I had one foot

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.220 
so you saw on that set I had one foot
placed<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.549> top<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> other<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.840> meant<00:02:25.080> i

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
placed on top of the other which meant i

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.009 
placed on top of the other which meant i
had<00:02:25.260> less<00:02:26.250> stable<00:02:26.760> floor<00:02:27.269> position<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.900> be

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
had less stable floor position to be

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.900 
had less stable floor position to be
able<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.260> pull<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.560> from<00:02:28.829> it's<00:02:29.459> made<00:02:29.610> me<00:02:29.760> have

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
able to pull up from it's made me have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.360 
able to pull up from it's made me have
to<00:02:29.940> work<00:02:30.060> harder<00:02:30.599> using<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.500> back<00:02:31.709> muscle<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
to work harder using my back muscle to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.990 
to work harder using my back muscle to
stabilize<00:02:32.579> me<00:02:33.090> during<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.480> movement<00:02:35.000> every

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
stabilize me during that movement every

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
stabilize me during that movement every
set<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.810> always<00:02:37.170> want<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.530> try<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.799> make<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
set I always want to try and make it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.660 
set I always want to try and make it
harder<00:02:38.430> whether<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.239> add<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.840> weight<00:02:40.049> or<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
harder whether I add more weight or I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.460 
harder whether I add more weight or I
increase<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.910> intensity<00:02:42.360> somehow<00:02:42.930> by

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
increase the intensity somehow by

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
increase the intensity somehow by
something<00:02:43.829> like<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.190> taking<00:02:44.610> away<00:02:44.819> one<00:02:44.970> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
something like that taking away one of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.210 
something like that taking away one of
my<00:02:45.150> foot<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.079> hand<00:02:46.230> positions<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.920> make<00:02:47.069> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
my foot or hand positions to make it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.559 
my foot or hand positions to make it
harder<00:02:48.140> my<00:02:49.140> back's<00:02:49.410> feeling<00:02:49.680> nice<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:49.980> warmed

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
harder my back's feeling nice and warmed

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.210 
harder my back's feeling nice and warmed
move<00:02:51.569> on<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> first<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.620> my<00:02:52.769> main<00:02:52.980> work

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
move on to the first of my main work

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.819 
move on to the first of my main work
sets<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:54.269> for<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.599> I'm<00:02:54.870> doing<00:02:55.140> bent<00:02:55.410> over

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
sets and for this I'm doing bent over

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.280 
sets and for this I'm doing bent over
barbell<00:02:55.980> rows<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.750> need<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.959> add<00:02:58.079> some

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
barbell rows I think we need to add some

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.910 
barbell rows I think we need to add some
weight<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.530> here<00:02:58.859> first<00:02:59.810> now<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.989> always<00:03:01.470> use<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
weight on here first now I always use a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.120 
weight on here first now I always use a
locking<00:03:02.430> collar<00:03:03.650> regardless<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.799> how<00:03:04.980> much

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
locking collar regardless of how much

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.910 
locking collar regardless of how much
weight<00:03:05.430> i<00:03:05.579> add<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.410> keep<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.739> weight

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
weight i add on just to keep the weight

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.770 
weight i add on just to keep the weight
fixed<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.700> position<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.660> going

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
fixed in that position so it's not going

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:32.920 
fixed in that position so it's not going
to<00:03:09.870> slide<00:03:10.139> back<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.440> forth<00:03:10.680> as<00:03:11.639> i'm<00:03:11.880> lifting

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.590 

I'm<00:03:33.930> already<00:03:34.170> starting<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.950> feel<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.190> blood

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
I'm already starting to feel the blood

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.930 
I'm already starting to feel the blood
pump<00:03:36.600> into<00:03:36.900> these<00:03:37.110> large<00:03:37.350> muscles<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pump into these large muscles in the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.020 
pump into these large muscles in the
back<00:03:39.740> this<00:03:40.740> is<00:03:40.860> what's<00:03:41.100> called<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.490> compound

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
back this is what's called a compound

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.780 
back this is what's called a compound
movement<00:03:42.740> relies<00:03:43.740> on<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:44.070> muscle<00:03:44.490> or<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
movement relies on the muscle or the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.840 
movement relies on the muscle or the
joint<00:03:45.060> moving<00:03:45.510> across<00:03:46.470> more<00:03:47.040> than<00:03:47.220> one<00:03:47.430> angle

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
joint moving across more than one angle

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.290 
joint moving across more than one angle
so<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.050> bent<00:03:49.260> over<00:03:49.620> my<00:03:49.650> knees<00:03:49.980> are<00:03:50.250> bent<00:03:50.430> my

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
so I'm bent over my knees are bent my

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.570 
so I'm bent over my knees are bent my
hips<00:03:51.570> are<00:03:51.720> pushed<00:03:51.959> back<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.220> I'm<00:03:53.310> bringing<00:03:53.459> my

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
hips are pushed back and I'm bringing my

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.660 
hips are pushed back and I'm bringing my
elbows<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.300> towards<00:03:54.989> my<00:03:55.290> shoulders<00:03:55.739> we're

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
elbows up towards my shoulders we're

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
elbows up towards my shoulders we're
really<00:03:56.760> squeezing<00:03:57.300> in<00:03:58.070> center<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.280> back

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
really squeezing in center of the back

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.890 
really squeezing in center of the back
this<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.840> great<00:04:01.140> mass<00:04:01.470> building<00:04:01.890> exercise

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
this is a great mass building exercise

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
this is a great mass building exercise
and<00:04:03.900> when<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.050> add<00:04:04.290> some<00:04:04.530> more<00:04:04.650> weight<00:04:04.830> on<00:04:05.060> it's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
and when I add some more weight on it's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.670 
and when I add some more weight on it's
really<00:04:06.239> going<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.510> help<00:04:06.660> me<00:04:06.870> increase<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
really going to help me increase the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.990 
really going to help me increase the
mass<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.250> size<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.420> my<00:04:10.290> lats<00:04:12.320> 12<00:04:13.320> reps<00:04:14.000> rest

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
mass and size of my lats 12 reps rest

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.330 
mass and size of my lats 12 reps rest
for<00:04:15.360> no<00:04:15.690> longer<00:04:15.870> than<00:04:16.019> one<00:04:16.350> minute<00:04:16.500> between

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
for no longer than one minute between

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.930 
for no longer than one minute between
each<00:04:17.730> set<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.329> then<00:04:19.109> try<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.470> add<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:20.010> much<00:04:20.700> as

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
each set and then try to add as much as

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.630 
each set and then try to add as much as
ten<00:04:21.209> percent<00:04:21.720> on<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> next<00:04:22.440> set<00:04:22.710> then<00:04:23.520> you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
ten percent on to the next set then you

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.110 
ten percent on to the next set then you
had<00:04:23.760> on<00:04:23.880> before<00:04:24.560> let's<00:04:25.560> get<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.890> it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.700 

now<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> whole<00:04:31.480> point<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.900> adding<00:04:32.170> more

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
now the whole point of adding more

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.970 
now the whole point of adding more
weight<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:34.150> overload<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.900> further<00:04:35.530> stress

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
weight is to overload and further stress

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.400 
weight is to overload and further stress
your<00:04:36.250> muscle<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.360> they're<00:04:37.810> able<00:04:38.050> to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
your muscle so that they're able to

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.270 
your muscle so that they're able to
repair<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.180> recover<00:04:40.230> stronger<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:42.010> be<00:04:42.130> able

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
repair and recover stronger to be able

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.550 
repair and recover stronger to be able
to<00:04:42.370> come<00:04:42.550> back<00:04:42.670> next<00:04:42.910> time<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.420> manage<00:04:44.290> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
to come back next time and manage the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.580 
to come back next time and manage the
same<00:04:44.830> weight<00:04:45.130> with<00:04:45.970> more<00:04:46.180> efficiency<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.530> you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
same weight with more efficiency so you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
same weight with more efficiency so you
don't<00:04:47.800> add<00:04:48.010> too<00:04:48.280> much<00:04:48.430> weight<00:04:48.730> maybe<00:04:49.000> every

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
don't add too much weight maybe every

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.480 
don't add too much weight maybe every
other<00:04:49.390> workout<00:04:49.990> try<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> add<00:04:51.010> more<00:04:51.340> weight

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
other workout try to add more weight

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.730 
other workout try to add more weight
than<00:04:51.700> you<00:04:51.820> lifted<00:04:52.150> before<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.840> then<00:04:53.440> allow

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
than you lifted before and then allow

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.320 
than you lifted before and then allow
your<00:04:53.980> body<00:04:54.100> enough<00:04:54.400> time<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.850> rest<00:04:55.090> and

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
your body enough time to rest and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.510 
your body enough time to rest and
recover<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:56.380> be<00:04:56.500> able<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.770> come<00:04:56.950> back<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.400> do

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
recover to be able to come back and do

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:28.480 
recover to be able to come back and do
it<00:04:57.550> again<00:04:57.690> even<00:04:58.690> harder<00:04:58.990> next<00:04:59.110> time

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.900 

I<00:05:32.419> pretty<00:05:33.419> much<00:05:33.540> hit<00:05:34.010> muscular<00:05:35.010> failure<00:05:35.610> there

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
I pretty much hit muscular failure there

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.870 
I pretty much hit muscular failure there
and<00:05:36.510> what<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:36.960> means<00:05:37.169> is<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:38.190> muscle<00:05:38.550> can<00:05:38.729> no

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
and what that means is the muscle can no

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.180 
and what that means is the muscle can no
longer<00:05:39.120> continue<00:05:39.690> to<00:05:40.500> lift<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.949> weight

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
longer continue to lift that weight

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.180 
longer continue to lift that weight
using<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.449> same<00:05:42.690> form<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.290> technique<00:05:43.740> and

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
using the same form and technique and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.719 
using the same form and technique and
it's<00:05:45.060> at<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.330> point<00:05:45.540> that<00:05:46.010> my<00:05:47.010> body<00:05:47.250> is<00:05:47.550> going

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
it's at that point that my body is going

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.330 
it's at that point that my body is going
to<00:05:47.880> send<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.600> signal<00:05:48.810> out<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.350> muscle<00:05:49.710> to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
to send a signal out to the muscle to

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.450 
to send a signal out to the muscle to
say<00:05:50.550> hey<00:05:51.479> man<00:05:51.770> you<00:05:52.770> got<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.010> get<00:05:53.130> better<00:05:53.250> at

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
say hey man you got to get better at

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.640 
say hey man you got to get better at
doing<00:05:53.580> this<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.990> only<00:05:55.110> way<00:05:55.260> you<00:05:55.320> can<00:05:55.500> get

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
doing this and the only way you can get

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.550 
doing this and the only way you can get
better<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.790> get<00:05:57.090> stronger<00:05:57.450> rebuild<00:05:58.410> the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
better is to get stronger rebuild the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.270 
better is to get stronger rebuild the
muscle<00:05:58.919> fibers<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.540> grow<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:01.889> that's<00:06:02.100> why

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
muscle fibers and grow so that's why

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.390 
muscle fibers and grow so that's why
rest<00:06:02.669> and<00:06:02.910> recovery<00:06:03.419> is<00:06:03.690> just<00:06:04.680> as<00:06:04.919> if<00:06:05.130> not<00:06:05.160> more

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
rest and recovery is just as if not more

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.730 
rest and recovery is just as if not more
important<00:06:06.150> than<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.169> actual<00:06:07.290> training

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
important than the actual training

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.460 
important than the actual training
itself
