thinking because like to help it not be

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.780 
thinking because like to help it not be
so<00:00:13.620> linear<00:00:13.889> as<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.400> you're<00:00:14.519> going<00:00:14.670> through

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
so linear as when you're going through

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.560 
so linear as when you're going through
like<00:00:16.039> each<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> tests<00:00:17.609> kind<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.970> areas<00:00:18.359> on

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
like each of the tests kind of areas on

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660 
like each of the tests kind of areas on
the<00:00:18.960> outside<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the outside like so there's going to be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
the outside like so there's going to be
like<00:00:20.820> multiple<00:00:21.240> ways<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.750> go<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.230> exact

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
like multiple ways you can go for exact

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800 
like multiple ways you can go for exact
so<00:00:22.650> I've<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.039> basically<00:00:23.810> explained

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
point during the thing there might be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 
point during the thing there might be
more<00:00:31.769> than<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:31.949> point<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> but

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
get like 42 of the answers right and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
get like 42 of the answers right and
wrong<00:01:21.540> wrong<00:01:21.750> another<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.979> open<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.889 
just to meet is my research switch to be
honest<00:01:43.950> another<00:01:44.700> charity<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
honest another charity of it and that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
honest another charity of it and that
probably<00:01:46.470> won't<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> actual<00:01:47.340> thing<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
probably won't be in the actual thing so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.080 
probably won't be in the actual thing so
I<00:01:48.350> probably<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:49.710> again<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> once<00:01:50.939> they

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I probably over again if I once they

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380 
I probably over again if I once they
implement<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.710> yeah<00:01:52.920> i'm<00:01:53.729> watching<00:01:54.180> lots

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
implement it but yeah i'm watching lots

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
implement it but yeah i'm watching lots
of<00:01:54.600> live<00:01:54.750> stream<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.470> him<00:01:55.710> doing<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> loon

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of live stream on him doing the loon

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.310 
of live stream on him doing the loon
there<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.119> gave<00:01:57.540> me<00:01:57.659> messing<00:01:57.930> around<00:01:57.990> while<00:01:58.290> i

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
there and gave me messing around while i

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
there and gave me messing around while i
do<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.159> might<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.520> video<00:01:59.729> today

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
do it so there might be more video today

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
do it so there might be more video today
of<00:02:00.210> other<00:02:01.200> things<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.680> I've<00:02:01.799> done<00:02:03.469> just<00:02:04.469> want

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
of other things that I've done just want

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
of other things that I've done just want
also<00:02:04.979> thing<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> mention<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
also thing to mention if you get it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
also thing to mention if you get it
wrong<00:02:06.689> I've<00:02:06.960> made<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> term

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
wrong I've made it so that term

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.740 
wrong I've made it so that term
you<00:02:08.700> can't<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.200> can't<00:02:10.530> enter<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can't even then you can't enter the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.730 
you can't even then you can't enter the
tight<00:02:12.750> end<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> right<00:02:13.170> when<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.560> through

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
tight end to the right when I go through

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.860 
tight end to the right when I go through
the<00:02:13.860> other<00:02:13.950> door<00:02:14.600> because<00:02:15.600> what<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.320> did<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the other door because what I did is I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310 
the other door because what I did is I
connected<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:20.030> deadlock<00:02:21.030> which<00:02:21.360> keeps<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
connected the deadlock which keeps the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.860 
connected the deadlock which keeps the
door<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.310> answer<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
door for the right answer to the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.010 
door for the right answer to the
research<00:02:25.260> switch<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.800> basically<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
research switch so basically the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.750 
research switch so basically the
dedlock's<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.680> these<00:02:28.800> don't<00:02:29.190> work<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
dedlock's with these don't work and you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240 
dedlock's with these don't work and you
can't<00:02:30.090> pass<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.930> current<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.920> open<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
can't pass it on the current to open the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.000 
can't pass it on the current to open the
other<00:02:32.310> door<00:02:33.290> Wow<00:02:35.390> yeah<00:02:36.390> well<00:02:36.740> once<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.860> open

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
other door Wow yeah well once you open

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.150 
other door Wow yeah well once you open
it<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.760> can't<00:02:39.000> reverse<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.040> yeah

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it is you can't reverse it so yeah

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
it is you can't reverse it so yeah
that's<00:02:41.280> pretty<00:02:41.400> much<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.670> short<00:02:41.970> video

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's pretty much it short video

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.970 
that's pretty much it short video
they're<00:02:43.140> probably<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.560> may<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.860> couple

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
they're probably you may be a couple

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.730 
they're probably you may be a couple
more<00:02:44.220> today<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.260> do<00:02:46.380> maybe<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
more today and because if you do maybe a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.420 
more today and because if you do maybe a
couple<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.160> short<00:02:47.370> videos<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:49.310> also<00:02:50.310> in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
couple of short videos on this also in

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.070 
couple of short videos on this also in
the<00:02:50.490> next<00:02:50.640> couple<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.850> days<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.810> should<00:02:51.990> be

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the next couple of days there should be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.550 
the next couple of days there should be
another<00:02:52.290> Hogwarts<00:02:52.890> update<00:02:54.200> I'll<00:02:55.200> look<00:02:55.380> at

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
