00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.260
 hello hello welcome on coco tv 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.870
 new introductory video with the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 big white shadow rock 2 a radiator on 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.080
 will say to the input positioning of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.760
 range compared to the brand one gets 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.310
 still located at 45 euros 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.010
 that said it's a beautiful beast with a 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.840
 top of the change of the usual black top 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 but it looks pretty good with the logo of 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.140
 the brand here four heatpipes 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.610
 as can be seen in relation to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.700
 plugs and if we look below that's it 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.870
 they are 8 mm heat pipes 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 rather rare thing lately 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.240
 tends to multiply 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.910
 heat pipes the finish she is excellent 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.750
 with a base type mirror not large 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.790
 to say above 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.310
 a priori it's rather flat there we have 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.660
 the legs that are installed for 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.180
 lindt she there had heard the paws 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.950
 end and that are provided and here we 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.250
 have the latest model of fans 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.920
 in 120 mm of the pwm range they go up to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.290
 1600 maximum announced we measured it 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.610
 a little over 1700 and very things 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.940
 interesting is that at the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.800
 noise 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.440
 he remains rather quiet then 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.930
 inevitably thoroughly he gets along but a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.360
 times the pwm properly configure it's 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.500
 really a treat especially they say they 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.690
 get along but it's not necessarily 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.360
 more noise than a fan of a 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.040
 mark x we will not mention mark hamill 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.310
 3004 or 2005 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.960
 it's very interesting he climbed on 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.940
 claws no system to mitigate 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 vibrations that said we do not have 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.420
 heard live and but mostly the most to 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.060
 our humble opinion is the cable that is 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.220
 very short then the editor and well 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.170
 finished the tariff position is 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.750
 rather good place at the level of a rbos 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.189
 a macho or bouts to 120 so we 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.350
 will see performance compared to its 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.360
 models even though we already suspect that he 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.950
 will be a little less efficient fan 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.549
 smaller month two heat pipes even though 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.980
 remains on the 8 mm but has a small 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.340
 defect we can already tell you then if 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.220
 we take this motherboard one of the ex a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 dx58so of 2 at intel so to memory 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.350
 here to know that it goes under the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.700
 fins here at the fan level 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.770
 that we can see there is a small 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.959
 gap so either we raise the fan 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.180
 either we put memory with a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.620
 low profile radiator so that stops 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.569
 the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.310
 your pcv but let's go back to the little ones 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.830
 usual problems at big white for 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.860
 the installation we go from below to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.580
 screw it is the case in amd but intel 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.290
 in fact we are going to put small nuts in 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.769
 pasta and just for 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 come fix the costs here and here with the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.790
 bundle key well it's not 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.230
 easy that's all there is to say the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.230
 test very quickly
