number one most important element of all
views<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.740> imagine<00:00:22.920> rhythm<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> time

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
views you can imagine rhythm and time

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109 
views you can imagine rhythm and time
it's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it's a little bit like this time is a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.810 
it's a little bit like this time is a
frame<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.500> rhythms<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> put

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
frame and the rhythms are what you put

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
frame and the rhythms are what you put
inside<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> picture<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> paint<00:00:31.560> so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
inside is the picture that you paint so

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
inside is the picture that you paint so
if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.610> cluttered<00:00:33.059> rhythms<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.660> only

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
if you have cluttered rhythms or only

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
if you have cluttered rhythms or only
the<00:00:34.350> same<00:00:34.559> rhythm<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.190> picture<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.790> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the same rhythm the picture can get very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420 
the same rhythm the picture can get very
boring<00:00:36.829> we're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> talk<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
boring we're going to talk about a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
boring we're going to talk about a
couple<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.820> different<00:00:39.120> techniques<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.930> will

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
couple of different techniques that will

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
couple of different techniques that will
expand<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.680> rhythm<00:00:40.920> vocabulary<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
expand your rhythm vocabulary it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
expand your rhythm vocabulary it
requires<00:00:42.540> patience<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.260> practice<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.890> after

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
requires patience and practice but after

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
requires patience and practice but after
enough<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.149> become<00:00:45.510> things<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
enough time they will become things that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
enough time they will become things that
you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> draw<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.280> playing<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you can draw on in your playing the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
you can draw on in your playing the
first<00:00:48.719> technique<00:00:49.010> involves<00:00:50.010> taking<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> same

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
first technique involves taking the same

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.380 
first technique involves taking the same
number<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:52.050> beats<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.340> same<00:00:53.579> frame<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
number of beats the same frame and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
number of beats the same frame and
putting<00:00:55.289> different<00:00:55.770> numbers<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> notes

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
putting different numbers of notes

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
putting different numbers of notes
inside<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> metronome

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
inside of it so let's take a metronome

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
inside of it so let's take a metronome
here<00:01:00.050> nice<00:01:01.050> slow<00:01:01.590> tempo<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.539> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> use<00:01:03.719> one

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
here nice slow tempo I want to use one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
here nice slow tempo I want to use one
beat<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.920> frame<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.729> we're<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> see

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
beat as our frame and we're going to see

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
beat as our frame and we're going to see
what<00:01:06.840> notes<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.740> inside<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
what notes we can put inside of this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
what notes we can put inside of this
frame<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.090> note<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
frame so say we have one note in one

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.950 
frame so say we have one note in one
beat<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.680> would<00:01:13.830> sound<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:20.360> one<00:01:21.360> no<00:01:21.630> end

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
beat it would sound like this one no end

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.730 
beat it would sound like this one no end
in<00:01:22.229> sight<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:24.049> now<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.470> two

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
in sight for me now going to take two

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
in sight for me now going to take two
notes<00:01:26.009> inside<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.630> would<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> eight

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
notes inside one be these would be eight

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.330 
notes inside one be these would be eight
notes

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.100 

the<00:01:38.340> next<00:01:38.670> step<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> take<00:01:39.810> three

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the next step would be to take three

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:52.020 
the next step would be to take three
notes<00:01:40.320> inside<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.040> v<00:01:41.220> could<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.790> triplets

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.910 

now<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.179> have<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.390> take<00:01:53.570> some<00:01:53.840> deep<00:01:54.049> knows<00:01:54.320> if

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
now we have to take some deep knows if

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.760 
now we have to take some deep knows if
we're<00:01:55.130> gonna<00:01:55.219> get<00:01:55.810> for<00:01:56.810> know<00:01:57.049> since<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.560> one

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
we're gonna get for know since I one

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:09.850 
we're gonna get for know since I one
week<00:02:07.119> now<00:02:08.119> let's<00:02:08.390> take<00:02:08.599> five<00:02:08.929> goats<00:02:09.259> inside

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

car 1v5 goats is a nice patty that's not

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.870 
car 1v5 goats is a nice patty that's not
used<00:02:23.299> very<00:02:23.360> often<00:02:24.160> now<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.220> last<00:02:25.519> thing<00:02:25.640> will

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
used very often now the last thing will

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:36.220 
used very often now the last thing will
take<00:02:25.910> sick<00:02:26.299> note<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> progression

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
take sick note so you have a progression

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:49.280 
take sick note so you have a progression
one<00:02:38.140> two<00:02:39.140> three

however fast you don't play it keep in

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.449 
however fast you don't play it keep in
mind<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.200> exercise<00:02:59.530> with<00:03:00.069> not

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
mind you can do this exercise with not

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.039 
mind you can do this exercise with not
just<00:03:00.489> one<00:03:00.790> beat<00:03:01.120> as<00:03:01.269> your<00:03:01.420> frame<00:03:01.659> but<00:03:01.959> you

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
just one beat as your frame but you

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.750 
just one beat as your frame but you
could<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.409> two<00:03:02.590> meats<00:03:02.829> as<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> frame<00:03:03.370> three

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
could do with two meats as a frame three

the commendations are totally endless
the<00:03:08.230> next<00:03:08.530> exercise<00:03:08.739> we're<00:03:09.099> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.280> do

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the next exercise we're going to do

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.720 
the next exercise we're going to do
involves<00:03:10.420> taking<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.930> same<00:03:11.170> frame<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:12.459> say

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
involves taking the same frame but say

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.610 
involves taking the same frame but say
for<00:03:12.939> example<00:03:13.000> four<00:03:13.569> beats<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.379> same

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
for example four beats and the same

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.680 
for example four beats and the same
number<00:03:14.920> notes<00:03:15.129> inside<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.670> those<00:03:15.760> piece<00:03:16.030> if<00:03:16.540> we

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
number notes inside of those piece if we

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080 
number notes inside of those piece if we
have<00:03:16.780> 78<00:03:17.230> notes<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.769> four<00:03:18.099> beats<00:03:18.340> will<00:03:18.609> miss<00:03:18.790> we

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
have 78 notes in four beats will miss we

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.030 
have 78 notes in four beats will miss we
are<00:03:19.450> missing<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:19.840> note<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:20.829> we're<00:03:20.950> going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
are missing one note so now we're going

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.559 
are missing one note so now we're going
to<00:03:21.099> take<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.310> line<00:03:25.829> very<00:03:26.829> simple<00:03:27.220> jazz<00:03:27.430> line<00:03:27.760> now

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
to take a line very simple jazz line now

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.759 
to take a line very simple jazz line now
what<00:03:28.720> we're<00:03:28.810> going<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.989> do<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.200> going<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.409> put<00:03:29.620> a

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
what we're going to do is going to put a

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.089 
what we're going to do is going to put a
rest<00:03:30.069> inside<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.760> line<00:03:31.030> dis<00:03:31.540> place<00:03:32.099> where

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
rest inside that line dis place where

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.089 
rest inside that line dis place where
the<00:03:33.370> rest<00:03:33.579> is<00:03:33.879> so<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.299> rest<00:03:34.480> will<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.750> all<00:03:35.109> 8

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
the rest is so the rest will be all 8

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.640 
the rest is so the rest will be all 8
8th<00:03:36.549> note<00:03:36.970> positions<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.810> those<00:03:38.139> four<00:03:38.409> beats

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
8th note positions in those four beats

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.039 
8th note positions in those four beats
that<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.040> rest<00:03:39.250> could<00:03:39.430> appear<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.569> first<00:03:40.810> one

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
that the rest could appear the first one

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.860 
that the rest could appear the first one
of<00:03:41.170> course<00:03:41.200> would<00:03:41.620> put<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.920> rest<00:03:42.129> first<00:03:42.459> rest

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.470 

and<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.250> forth<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.180> we're<00:03:49.299> going<00:03:49.389> to

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and so on and so forth so we're going to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.030 
and so on and so forth so we're going to
turn<00:03:49.540> our<00:03:49.599> backs<00:03:49.840> on<00:03:49.930> them<00:03:50.049> back<00:03:50.199> on<00:03:50.410> in<00:03:50.919> the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
turn our backs on them back on in the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
turn our backs on them back on in the
first<00:03:51.250> example<00:03:51.519> of<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.359> line<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.989> rest<00:03:53.260> will

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
first example of this line the rest will

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.009 
first example of this line the rest will
be<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.190> end<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.760> beat<00:03:55.030> walk<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.599> line<00:03:55.750> will

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
be on the end of beat walk the line will

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:05.750 
be on the end of beat walk the line will
sound<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.349> this<00:03:56.699> want<00:03:57.699> to<00:04:04.440> second<00:04:05.440> example

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
sound like this want to second example

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.580 
sound like this want to second example
the<00:04:06.760> rest<00:04:07.329> will<00:04:07.480> move<00:04:07.629> one<00:04:07.870> more<00:04:08.109> eighth<00:04:08.319> note

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
the rest will move one more eighth note

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.250 
the rest will move one more eighth note
so<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.099> it<00:04:09.280> appears<00:04:09.340> on<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.150> downbeat<00:04:10.419> of<00:04:10.690> b2

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
so that it appears on the downbeat of b2

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:24.150 
so that it appears on the downbeat of b2
like<00:04:12.099> this<00:04:12.310> one<00:04:12.760> two<00:04:13.209> three<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.949> third

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
like this one two three in the third

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.640 
like this one two three in the third
example<00:04:24.550> again<00:04:25.389> we<00:04:25.570> move<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.900> rest<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.620> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
example again we move the rest so that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:39.719 
example again we move the rest so that
is<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.580> end<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:28.210> each<00:04:28.510> one<00:04:29.199> two

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:54.230 

the<00:04:40.360> rest<00:04:40.569> to<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.050> downbeat<00:04:41.499> III<00:04:41.949> like<00:04:42.189> this

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.399 

so<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.509> see<00:04:55.629> how<00:04:55.659> just<00:04:55.960> placing<00:04:56.319> this

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
so you can see how just placing this

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.529 
so you can see how just placing this
rest<00:04:56.710> further<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.189> further<00:04:57.339> inside<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.360> line

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
rest further and further inside the line

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.769 
rest further and further inside the line
it's<00:04:59.020> going<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.710> make<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.009> even<00:05:00.189> more

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
it's going to make it even more

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.089 
it's going to make it even more
displaced<00:05:01.779> even<00:05:02.139> more<00:05:02.319> awkward<00:05:02.529> sounding

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
displaced even more awkward sounding

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.950 
displaced even more awkward sounding
more<00:05:03.279> jackets<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.909> more<00:05:04.150> smooth<00:05:04.509> signing

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
more jackets and more smooth signing

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.989 
more jackets and more smooth signing
however<00:05:05.559> you<00:05:05.710> want<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.919> do<00:05:06.069> it<00:05:06.189> so<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.699> can<00:05:06.879> do

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:06.999 
however you want to do it so you can do

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.510 
however you want to do it so you can do
