00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.110
 the other one can already rise a bit 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.890
 As of May 1, 2010 so far, most virtual worlds have been called 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.659
 Entertainment offers designed 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.659
 many are still considered players 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.050
 Also in the future, maybe the education sector will become 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.050
 Health researchers and the military use them 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.780
 In concrete terms, that would be fine 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.110
 The exciting thing about this industry is that it is now where the internet is 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.570
 1994 was 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.120
 At that time I had a crazy in every company that said that 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.750
 You absolutely have to have a website and just for incomprehension 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.870
 Erfassers dar around four years later gave the same companies 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 Hundreds of thousands of dollars for internet appearances statement that it is in 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.670
 the capital some programmers are looking forward to a time in the one 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.070
 Much of life in virtual reality will take place 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.070
 others say that it has long been so far 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.080
 Since their invention almost 50 years ago, video games have grown rapidly 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.590
 advanced 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.560
 he sings in the staging because of staying video games are a lot today 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.320
 better than before and the technology is so complex that I can not do it anymore 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.870
 Understand the simulations are also becoming more realistic 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 that's really something else in the foreground 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.329
 how good we are with the 3ds the possibilities of this medium 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.149
 overarching to the fortress sitting there every game has happened a lot in Oslo 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.170
 already outdated 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 and one predicts that from 2008 more turnover 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.100
 the film and music industry collided 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
 varied graphics interesting stories and advanced interactive 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.880
 Elements have become video games the leading entertainment medium 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.900
 There is much to suggest that their importance will continue to grow in the future 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.110
 It will continue fighting games role-playing games further from the game and sports 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.960
 There will be games and certain facilities »for all of us 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 Surprised »says Rossol and we are also working on a new technology 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 called 5 4 IE 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.640
 simulate the response of our nervous system to environmental stimuli 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.300
 Fix solution a year ago 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.610
 As the last round in the next few years, the technology will be up to 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 To further develop a point where you yourself are part of the rapper systolic 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.909
 Every development step in the history of video games has us 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.349
 brought a little closer to this vision 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.480
 At first, user interfaces were developed to get us deeper into that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.449
 to be dunked 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.989
 then you invented characters for personal attachment to the game 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.269
 strengthen 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.689
 In the next step, the programmers created a multi-layered one 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.879
 three-dimensional world that shows us the great potential of the technology 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.849
 led 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.709
 and finally, it allowed the players still these virtual worlds 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.349
 to participate creatively 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.050
 In the future, however, it will no longer be all about video games 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.059
 Challenges and competitions go 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.639
 but in a virtual world 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.729
 It is rumored that the powerful mobile phones will be free to move 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.989
 the more opportunities there is a part of our life in the virtual 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.019
 Reality want to spend we want to be interested now and then 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:08.570
 to get 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.330
 Steiner 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.000
 People who used to hurry home to look at PC offenders looking for them 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.140
 their children transform the phone into a game console 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:23.499
 Hoboken off your knees you have to ask yourself questions like these interactive media 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.089
 People can be used to connect with each other 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.109
 Express feelings and formulate their interests SAS

 Shinji Okazaki 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.189
 a new he brings his fate in the end it is not about the quality of the 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.019
 But the graphics are about whether the games help them communicate with each other 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 she never moves with erotic world literature 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.799
 Alpiq the minister's focus of the games will be more and more on the player 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.249
 Shifting space and games are becoming more complex with our real world 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.249
 be interwoven on 1 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:56.900
 ca 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.600
 here I would like to immerse each of the perfect one virtual world 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.219
 to encourage it 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 not identical to the Euro now won 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.599
 In the future there will probably be no boundaries between virtual and not 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.169
 Give virtual reality by Arne Grohmann be it the goal 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.769
 I think the original dividing lines will disappear and the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.520
 World will go mingle 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.690
 then we see that the problem of video games is that we 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.139
 us to entice everything else for the reality but in the normal work 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.250
 And even in the world outside the games, not everything is the same 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.770
 seems 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.090
 even if, of course, it is not a matrix in Alsdorf of a complete merger 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.569
 the police took Togo is she reality to them and they become reality 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.590
 a game is still a game I do not believe that video games 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.559
 Take control of our lives Mainz 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.489
 Westerwald I find that many people are thoughtless about the subject 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:59.379
 express themselves and think too much in aloof friends fiction categories 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:04.639
 in the end, we are and will remain only human beings PHZ whole 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.330
 world 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.979
 live images from Israel and the US I think that it in the 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.349
 Never have a history of human history in a virtual history 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.050
 So I keep all the excitement in virtual worlds of the world 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.719
 Freedom we finally have the language 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.309
 would you tell me what another guy did last week as well 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.500
 They never personally met me, I would mine 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.489
 Nevertheless, head immediately a picture of history and the church is that 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:33.379
 perhaps not virtually the St defines this ability and as humans 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.589
 especially 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.430
 irritated in a virtual world to live 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.419
 one day finds future vision but already reality is true 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.509
 Sports 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.110
 Borgolte is all about the video game promoting culture as an individual 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.229
 about alter ego sum to define fantasy worlds 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.419
 the Ticino 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.840
 Every year, new better players in the market come to us the perfect 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.840
 bring digital illusion closer 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.610
 we will one day be big parts of our lives in a virtual world 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.610
 Spend a game world that only exists in our imagination 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.389
 and in the real touches 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.389
 are no longer possible 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.849
 to have
