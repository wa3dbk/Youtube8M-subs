00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.800
 hello to everyone I'm Elijah 362 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.170
 I bring this new video and this time 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.700
 commented gameplay of gta 5 online in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.799
 this time I bring you nowhere 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 Secret or any weird vehicle or anything 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.400
 like that but in the background you have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 a game with josemi that basically 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 we've been playing this morning when 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.550
 we have woken up this video what 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.040
 you'll be watching at about 7 7 and a half 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.750
 or about 8 in the afternoon but 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.370
 well we had woken up and before 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.590
 put us to edit we have gotten a 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.420
 little to gta 5 so I've taken the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.369
 best highlights of how we created 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 destruction and destruction persecutions 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.660
 police in a few words but good 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 the game is in the background without further 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.199
 you want to see her if you want to just listen to me 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.999
 I know that many people do not see my 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.530
 videos but listen to them because 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.879
 later the game does not have much 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.039
 importance on this occasion since we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.569
 he taught nothing special or anything for the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.100
 style but good that I come to you 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.499
 speak then I come to talk about the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.839
 bans and withdrawal of money that has been 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.120
 won fraudulently in gta 5 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.829
 online as advertised in a video 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.769
 that I did exclusively for the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.170
 update 1.09 denying many 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.030
 news that many people many 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 forgiveness people said that it included this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.330
 upgrade 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.490
 but they really only included some 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 things between them is that they were going to put 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 a kind of locator to the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.920
 cheaters who are cheats by is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.010
 say what they do tricks and so on and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.050
 between those people because they were also 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.850
 included so to speak people 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.310
 that made clichés and so on, why do not you 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.740
 They will be worth as I said if you make a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 glitch klich of the game itself does not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.280
 can bathe basically because it's a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 rockstar problem has been done wrong 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 game in quotes if they have a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.040
 small bug because it's your fault not and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 therefore you can not plan but 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 good because why they were also 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.010
 including those people who used 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 clichés because they are much more prone to 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.810
 do tricks I do not know that there's no 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 generalize but it 's like that so good has 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.369
 there were many bans many of you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.440
 you have informed me of that 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.750
 yourselves many people many 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.060
 of my subscribers of san banned and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.790
 besides that I think that almost almost 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 almost all of us have retired something of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.630
 money already because they gave it to us or 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.179
 because we have played a game in the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.330
 that they gave infinity of money in plan 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.000
 $ 30,000 at a time then all of us 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.140
 they have removed a bit from the ine 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.239
 this is because it is good as I said 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
 it's because you have gotten that money to 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.470
 through fraudulent activities that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.720
 are not explicit within the game by 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.280
 so to say I think this from my 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.379
 personal opinion this is an opinion 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.480
 staff and what I emphasize is pretty good 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.010
 that they do it because the game is going to happen 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.900
 to be pretty clean yes that's true 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 that we are surely in the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.650
 update 1.09 god knows how many 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.200
 updates may remain until 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.269
 leave the next gta or until they decide 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.980
 stop taking updates of 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.379
 improve the game by cleaning it so 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.829
 say it but surely tricks come out 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.870
 new ones come out hacks and get out of all that 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.209
 it's like that in all the games that's like that in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.519
 call of duty in gta in battlefield in 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.090
 any game really does not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.160
 regardless of who has 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.629
 Dedicated servers or servers 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.099
 game officials that's a lie 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.739
 always always always there is some hack 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.560
 not so good from my point of view 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.450
 I think this makes me pretty 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.879
 cleaner, at least 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.349
 for a month or two months or a week 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.239
 God knows how long we can last without 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.250
 tricks but the truth is that I think 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.110
 pretty good on the part of rockstar me 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.420
 I warned, I warned you 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.650
 that many people were going to be banned 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.470
 I personally have not been handled 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 because I have not done any trick of these 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.750
 so be it 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.280
 hardcore so to speak give you a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.110
 lot of money millions and millions of 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.300
 money but yes it is true that josemi 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.550
 for example he had a lot of millions 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.930
 but he had not done the trick but 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.160
 they had given the money therefore to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 he has not been shot but he is 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.210
 true that they have withdrawn the money 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.780
 they have left him with 400 thousand dollars I think 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.600
 remember me personally had I think 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.280
 that 400 thousand dollars or 300 and a thousand 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.260
 dollars that I had earned so 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.580
 honest so to speak in games that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.740
 maybe they get a little more money 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.750
 normal as I explained in 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.950
 yesterday's game for example but not 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.930
 it was no trick that rockstar decided 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 banning less is not something that is right 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.720
 for bans but yes it's true that I 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.510
 they have taken away a lot of money and they have 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 left with with 150 thousand dollars dollars 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.520
 forgiveness approximately so nothing to 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.709
 tell me in the comments what do you think 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.239
 this issue that they go in to the people of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.010
 that they withdraw the money because I know that 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.720
 it is something that affects many very many 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.290
 from you I forgive all those who 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.690
 you play gta 5 basically 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.950
 and well then that same tell me tell me 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.110
 in the comments that you think of 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.390
 regarding this rockstar initiative 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.970
 this server cleanup so 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.100
 say it and well then nothing more 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.540
 know do not argue in the comments 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.300
 please that I had to tell you no 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.940
 you argue this is a debate so nothing 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.470
 let's see what decision we reached 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.670
 debating among all I hope that you 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.050
 have liked this video that you have 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.000
 well spent these five minutes 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.740
