00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
um I was incorrect this isn't like a

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
um I was incorrect this isn't like a
well<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> guess<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
well I guess it could be some kind of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.340 
well I guess it could be some kind of
high-tech<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:58.110> um

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
high-tech thing but it's actually um

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
high-tech thing but it's actually um
what<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> thought<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.890> another<00:01:59.159> little

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
what I thought was another little

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
what I thought was another little
booklet<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> marketing<00:02:00.930> fluff<00:02:01.110> bag<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.530> was

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
actually a little cutout of the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
actually a little cutout of the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
Fantastic Four and you just kind of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.039 
Fantastic Four and you just kind of
stick<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> cardboard<00:02:05.159> wedge<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
set it up by his it's supposed to be

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000 
so I mean honestly I could have took her
lit<00:02:18.090> left<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.290> don't<00:02:19.440> care<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
lit left this I really don't care for it

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.620 
lit left this I really don't care for it
it's<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.640> my<00:02:20.760> display<00:02:21.210> although

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
it's not gonna go in my display although

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
it's not gonna go in my display although
I<00:02:21.660> could<00:02:21.900> probably<00:02:21.930> put<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.530> somewhere<00:02:22.730> um

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
I could probably put it up somewhere um

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.560 
I could probably put it up somewhere um
so<00:02:24.450> yeah<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.990> not<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> huge<00:02:25.440> deal<00:02:25.680> anyway

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.960 
put too much force on it it's gonna snap
even<00:03:13.860> though<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> pretty<00:03:14.459> dense<00:03:14.700> piece

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
even though it is a pretty dense piece

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.120 
even though it is a pretty dense piece
of<00:03:15.090> plastic<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.660> um<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.650> huge<00:03:16.920> loss

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
of plastic so um it's not a huge loss

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.370 
of plastic so um it's not a huge loss
there's<00:03:17.370> very<00:03:17.550> little<00:03:17.790> movement<00:03:18.060> there<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.870> no

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
there's very little movement there so no

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.830 
there's very little movement there so no
well<00:03:19.560> um<00:03:20.660> very<00:03:21.660> slight<00:03:22.200> torso<00:03:23.100> articulation

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
well um very slight torso articulation

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and down his legs seem to be on a ball

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.790 
and down his legs seem to be on a ball
joint<00:03:35.720> very<00:03:36.720> slight<00:03:37.080> movement<00:03:37.260> at<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> knee

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
joint very slight movement at the knee

as<00:03:38.220> well<00:03:38.930> as<00:03:39.930> very<00:03:40.440> slight<00:03:40.890> movement<00:03:41.070> at<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
as well as very slight movement at the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.600 
as well as very slight movement at the
ankle<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.090> can<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.630> joint<00:03:42.930> there<00:03:43.200> oh

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
ankle you can see the joint there oh

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.920 
ankle you can see the joint there oh
this<00:03:44.610> one<00:03:44.790> there's<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.030> little<00:03:45.209> bit<00:03:45.300> better<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
this one there's a little bit better you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.340 
this one there's a little bit better you
can<00:03:46.050> see

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
can see

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.130 
can see
so<00:03:47.100> all<00:03:47.370> those<00:03:47.550> articulation<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.390> very<00:03:48.660> slight

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
so all those articulation is very slight

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.009 
so all those articulation is very slight
but<00:03:49.709> um<00:03:49.860> honestly<00:03:50.760> with<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> figure<00:03:51.570> this<00:03:51.750> big

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
but um honestly with a figure this big

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.670 
but um honestly with a figure this big
there's<00:03:52.260> got<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.590> some<00:03:52.769> sacrifices

disappointed<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.070> we<00:04:51.190> lost<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:52.030> base<00:04:52.210> in

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
disappointed that we lost the base in

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.030 
disappointed that we lost the base in
favor<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:52.930> little<00:04:53.200> cardboard<00:04:53.560> cutout<00:04:54.010> I

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
favor of this little cardboard cutout I

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.130 
favor of this little cardboard cutout I
mean<00:04:54.540> what<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.630> this<00:04:55.720> supposed<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.020> be<00:04:56.110> a

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
mean what is this supposed to be a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.990 
mean what is this supposed to be a
background<00:04:56.770> because<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.280> can't<00:04:57.520> see<00:04:57.730> it<00:04:57.760> and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
background because you can't see it and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.400 
background because you can't see it and
it<00:04:58.270> just<00:04:58.390> seems<00:04:58.570> pointless<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:59.020> kind<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.230> stick

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
it just seems pointless to kind of stick

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.640 
it just seems pointless to kind of stick
it<00:04:59.440> beside<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.800> figure<00:05:00.160> like<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.500> um

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
it beside the figure like this so um

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.470 
it beside the figure like this so um
would<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.370> much<00:05:03.550> preferred<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:04.030> base<00:05:04.210> but

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
would have much preferred the base but

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.060 
would have much preferred the base but
it's<00:05:04.690> not<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:05.050> this<00:05:05.170> figure<00:05:05.500> has<00:05:05.650> any<00:05:05.830> issue

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
it's not like this figure has any issue

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.430 
it's not like this figure has any issue
standing<00:05:06.610> without<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:07.050> that<00:05:08.050> being<00:05:08.230> said<00:05:08.350> this

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
standing without it that being said this

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.830 
standing without it that being said this
