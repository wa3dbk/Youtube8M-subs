 had the good idea to put himself the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.109
 Catalan public in the pocket right from 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.389

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.949
 her coach had judged her almost too much

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.819
 French 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.049
 but it's the Parisians in black who 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.420
 are the first ones in action with this 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.799
 ball of fillol for clisson pisson 25 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.109
 meters facing the poles that passes a 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.760
 drop after only two minutes this is 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.859
 paris that leads to perpignan 3 to 0 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.749
 immediate reaction of the Peruvians in 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.069
 talk about camille lopez then players and 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.989
 well it is he who addresses this 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.760
 last pass in any case there who 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.960
 pierced the Parisian defense for 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.820
 go mark the first try this 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.039
 match in perpignan go forward to score 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.399
 to lead 7 to 3 after only 5 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.829
 minutes 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.899
 in the wake the same side action 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.850
 Parisian in fillol colors for peas 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.490
 have a new drop am the most 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.859
 complicated but that again because that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 does 7 to 6 in favor of perpignan's 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.549
 right only eight minutes for jules 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.130
 plisson 7 to 6 then 10 annette none 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.060
 penalty on each side 29th minute then 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.740
 that gonzalo quesada is not 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.859
 completely reassured again 29th minute 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.600
 in touch the paschal pascal fault that 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.789
 hustle vahaamahina on this alignment 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.229
 sir ruiz larbi from their meeting goes 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.359
 inflict a yellow card that can 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.590
 seem a little bit severe always 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.359
 is it that the Parisians find themselves 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.850
 outnumbered and in addition 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.170
 behind the penalty is successful by 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.200

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.759
 of advanced to the Catalans to lead 13 to 9 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.710
 the Parisians are in inferiority 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.240
 digital but we find them in front of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.649
 line of the Catalans the ball lands 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 in the hands of flanquart who is going 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.200
 score the first betting test in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.440
 this match looked at the right of your screen

 rabadan holding back may guitoune 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.770
 your video will judge that there is no 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.479
 impact on the defense of 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.850
 perpignanais paris leads 16 to 13 32nd 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.520
 gorgeous minute clearing cathedral 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.470
 sullied on yonne and more behind 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.750
 both players will exchange moves 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.850
 of fist caricaturing in total 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.350
 it should have been two yellow cards 2 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.600
 red cartons for weathered a carton 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.670
 red for yonne but in the end the refereed 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.160
 video will only give a simple 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.620
 curious penalty later antoine 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.270
 burban tears him out naias 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.820
 are you going to support that speeds up who 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.400
 escapes kick to follow from 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.990
 Parisian good cover of guitoune 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.030
 perpignan side who are leaving on his 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.230
 left it's clogged inside hook 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.490
 again it's a little clogged it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.290
 returns to his goal then finally 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.940
 found a solution to the outside there 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 accelerates and finds more than the tuque to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.300
 acquit him call my daughter my daughter and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.500
 who is alone on saone she who 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.420
 to follow he is embarrassed in his 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.370
 progression but benvenuti followed well 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.020
 get this ball back and mark the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.810
 second perpignan attempt in this 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.600
 meeting in perpignan who passes in front of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.890
 to the score to lead 20 to 16 benvenuti 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.320
 the Italian who arrived in the offseason 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.790
 from Treviso on this 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.430
 action you will see also a 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.170
 beautiful tackle of durban on my daughter 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.790
 which will earn him a yellow card of the coup 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.560
 the Parisians will play for a 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.080
 minute thirty to 13 against 15 and in 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.810
 numerical inferiority almost during 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.070
 and here it is this burban tackle at the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.480
 pause is perpignan that leads from 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.200
 four points from one to 16 and yet marc 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.850
 delpoux who is not completely 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.170
 satisfied and for good reason the stadium 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.370
 French played against the wind during this 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.080
 first act has only four points of 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.340
 delay in addition marc delpoux who must 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.540
 to pass from camilo not his return from 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.560
 cloakrooms injured ribs and who 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.240
 could be missing for several 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.490
 weeks you add to that the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.290
 Parisian domination in melee the 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.120
 Catalans who commit far too much 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.660
 faults and that allow Jerome 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.940
 Porical 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.090
 the former usap player to pass 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.690
 three penalties in 6 minutes that gives back 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 an advantage in paris 25 to 20 porical 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.160
 author of a 5 out of 5 during this 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.600
 evening 3 58th minute justin scared is taken 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.130
 in the offside position 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.930
 he gets a yellow card for 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.730
 accumulation of faults of his team 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.780
 the perpignanais are in turn in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.459
 numerical inferiority and like the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.690
 Parisians in the first period and is created 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.070
 a great opportunity with this kick 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.980
 to follow from August 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.450
 the rebound worn for guittoum that goes 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.310
 mark the third attempt of perpignan 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 in this match and it's in pignan that makes 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.900
 takes the lead in the score to lead 27 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.280
 20 minutes to the end of 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.260
 Catalans who are only one try 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.880
 offensive bonus 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.900
 the end of the match will be tense until 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.700
 last we are in the last seconds 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.110
 the last ball and in favor of the stadium 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.430
 French with without it is she who 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.060
 is taken but the ball still a little 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.910
 to the east of Paris 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.910
 dupuy will release this balloon for pis on 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.739
 that they spend a third drop at 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.299
 course of this match and especially give the 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:44.019
 victory to his team the French stadium 

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:47.269
 two points in Catalonia 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:50.089
 28 to 27 superb stadium performance 

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:51.860
 French on the other hand obviously for the 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.319
 Catalan it's a big blow behind the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.869
 head in the image of their coach marc 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.469
 deloux x inevitably fatalistic at the end 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:59.269
 of his meeting 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.789
 of course everything we distinguish two or 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:03.469
 three months this round we lost to 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.669
 last second we missed the 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.529
 melee conquest that was not 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.759
 satisfactory 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.559
 we missed a lot of numbers it's a 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.059
 second-line and powerful guy who 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.239
 were not there we certainly 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:16.489
 prevented cause of his incredible that a 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:17.809
 drop 3 drops for jules plisson in this 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.999
 match then we have to see him again 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:23.059
 necessarily to the pallet prepared by 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:25.219
 thomas glavany who measured exactly 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:31.369
 this drop 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:33.229
 look at 37 m but especially under pressure 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:34.879
 what cold blood we were playing last 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.599
 minute of the game the last seconds 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.249
 he is 22 years old 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.529
 often complained of not having to 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.969
 open french in top 14 it's a 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.769
 nice answer from jules plisson of this 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.179
 evening and three drops succeeded by the same 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:46.699
 player during a match that was not 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:48.769
 more arrived since December 2011 it was 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.749
 already at the time a French opener 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:52.729
 international lionel beauis it was 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:55.189
 with Toulouse facing Montpellier then 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.199
 we have seen Julius decisive plisson certainly 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.149
 but mostly happy that his team has 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.700
 finally regain efficiency he was 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.620
 at the microphone of michel macurdy especially that 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.150
 we did not get it 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.050
 the opportunity to score each time 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.280
 was at home so I think 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.390
 that today I will leave state of mind 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.580
 that had to be scorched from - which in 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.990
 their 40 m so here I think that 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.950
 I would have his town hall it succeeded me but 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.070
 I had so much the last wrist 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.370
 that I'm faking people but a few 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.370
 today
