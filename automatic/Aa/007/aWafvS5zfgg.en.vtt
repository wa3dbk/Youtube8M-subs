00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hi everyone in this video we're going to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.889 
hi everyone in this video we're going to
do<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> comparison<00:00:05.180> between<00:00:06.180> these<00:00:06.690> two

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
do a comparison between these two

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.760 
do a comparison between these two
engines<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:09.090> axial<00:00:10.340> point<00:00:11.340> 28<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:15.770> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
engines the axial point 28 and the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.160 
engines the axial point 28 and the
Thunder<00:00:17.160> Tiger<00:00:18.830> point<00:00:19.830> 21

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:41.350 

in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.340> Schumacher's<00:00:27.590> let's<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.980> out

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:54.070 

but<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

all<00:00:55.080> right<00:00:55.290> let's<00:00:55.830> put<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.280> side-by-side

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.200 

the<00:01:02.100> Thunder<00:01:02.430> Tiger<00:01:02.840> is<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> real<00:01:04.380> reliable

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
the Thunder Tiger is a real reliable

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.870 
the Thunder Tiger is a real reliable
engine<00:01:06.380> that's<00:01:07.380> perfect<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> Menace

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.150 

it's<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.180> powerful

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.260 

it<00:01:17.160> has<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.440 

the<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:20.990> way<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.350> very<00:01:21.590> reliable<00:01:22.240> try<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.299> get

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the one way is very reliable try to get

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.190 
the one way is very reliable try to get
a<00:01:23.479> better<00:01:23.720> focus<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:28.580> lasts<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.450> very<00:01:29.600> long

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
a better focus and it lasts a very long

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.399 
a better focus and it lasts a very long
time<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.340> fact<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:32.000> can't<00:01:32.810> tell<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.140> how<00:01:33.350> many

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
time in fact I can't tell you how many

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.249 
time in fact I can't tell you how many
gallons<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.340> put<00:01:34.940> through<00:01:35.930> them<00:01:36.110> they<00:01:36.229> just

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
gallons I put through them they just

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.690 
gallons I put through them they just
keep<00:01:36.650> on<00:01:36.800> going<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.670> going<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.270> going

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.190 

now<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.930> axle<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.740> Menace<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:50.200> really

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
now the axle and the Menace it really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.040 
now the axle and the Menace it really
changes<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.680> Menace<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:53.000> takes<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:54.020> a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
changes the Menace it takes it to a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.700 
changes the Menace it takes it to a
different<00:01:54.320> level<00:01:55.810> point<00:01:56.810> 28<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:59.350> this<00:02:00.350> too<00:02:00.679> is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
different level point 28 and this too is

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.169 
different level point 28 and this too is
very<00:02:01.100> reliable<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.420> idles<00:02:02.869> really<00:02:03.140> good<00:02:04.179> it's

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
very reliable it idles really good it's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.160 
very reliable it idles really good it's
easy<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.720> start<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:08.149> one-way<00:02:08.539> lost<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.989> long

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
easy to start the one-way lost a long

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.310 
easy to start the one-way lost a long
time<00:02:11.500> both<00:02:12.500> engines<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.010> good<00:02:13.220> engines<00:02:14.320> you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
time both engines are good engines you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.470 
time both engines are good engines you
just<00:02:15.590> take<00:02:15.769> care<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.070> them<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.030> after<00:02:17.330> running

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
just take care of them but after running

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.380 
just take care of them but after running
aisle<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.959> them<00:02:18.110> every<00:02:18.380> time<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.390> they'll

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
aisle in them every time and they'll

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.220 
aisle in them every time and they'll
last<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.810> long<00:02:21.019> long<00:02:21.290> time

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.360 

the<00:02:27.739> axle

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
the axle

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.710 
the axle
I<00:02:30.440> haven't<00:02:31.440> did<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> top<00:02:31.950> speed<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.720> but

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
I haven't did the top speed on it but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479 
I haven't did the top speed on it but
when<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.050> when<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.440> change<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.920> these<00:02:35.129> tires

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
when I when you change out these tires

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.930 
when I when you change out these tires
to<00:02:36.209> these<00:02:36.440> I've<00:02:37.440> noticed<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.040> does<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.760> in

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
to these I've noticed it does make it in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.530 
to these I've noticed it does make it in
the<00:02:39.030> top<00:02:39.060> end<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.620> much<00:02:40.830> faster<00:02:42.230> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the top end just that much faster and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
the top end just that much faster and
take<00:02:45.540> off<00:02:45.980> torque<00:02:46.980> wise<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.580> just

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
take off torque wise it's just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.360 
take off torque wise it's just
unbelievable<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.110> makes<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.530> into<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
unbelievable and it makes it into a I

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.559 
unbelievable and it makes it into a I
mean<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.209> point<00:02:51.450> 21<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.170> powerful<00:02:52.650> enough<00:02:52.890> I

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
mean the point 21 is powerful enough I

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.309 
mean the point 21 is powerful enough I
mean<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.750> really<00:02:56.030> goes<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:58.140> this

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
mean it really goes for this for this

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.309 
mean it really goes for this for this
one<00:02:58.590> 10th<00:02:59.569> for<00:03:00.569> old<00:03:00.780> drive<00:03:01.049> nitro<00:03:01.640> truck<00:03:02.640> but

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
one 10th for old drive nitro truck but

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.470 
one 10th for old drive nitro truck but
the<00:03:04.319> axle<00:03:04.950> makes<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.819> medicine<00:03:05.970> through<00:03:06.299> like

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the axle makes the medicine through like

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.550 
the axle makes the medicine through like
a<00:03:06.510> super<00:03:07.019> Menace<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.970> amazing<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
a super Menace it is amazing and it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
a super Menace it is amazing and it
doesn't<00:03:10.920> suck<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.709> nitro<00:03:14.250> out<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.090> I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
doesn't suck the nitro out of there so I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.500 
doesn't suck the nitro out of there so I
mean<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:17.190> runtimes<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:17.879> still<00:03:18.360> very

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
mean that the runtimes are still very

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.460 
mean that the runtimes are still very
long<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:21.379> it's<00:03:22.379> just<00:03:22.470> an<00:03:22.860> amazing<00:03:24.470> it's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
long on it it's just an amazing it's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.619 
long on it it's just an amazing it's
amazing<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.489> watch<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.910> videos<00:03:27.269> I

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
amazing and if you watch the videos I

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.710 
amazing and if you watch the videos I
put<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.950> mean<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.310> really<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:30.030> changes<00:03:30.569> it

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
put up I mean it really just changes it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.819 
put up I mean it really just changes it
changes<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:32.430> whole<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> super<00:03:35.100> Menace<00:03:35.400> yeah

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
changes the whole to a super Menace yeah

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.390 
changes the whole to a super Menace yeah
so<00:03:37.970> those<00:03:38.970> are<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.269> comparison<00:03:39.989> between<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
so those are the comparison between the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.300 
so those are the comparison between the
two<00:03:41.430> they're<00:03:41.819> both<00:03:42.000> good<00:03:42.269> engines

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.660 

they're<00:03:47.310> both<00:03:47.459> addicting<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
they're both addicting and this is the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.460 
they're both addicting and this is the
Thunder<00:03:50.910> Tigers<00:03:51.300> really<00:03:51.599> more<00:03:51.989> than<00:03:52.140> enough

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
Thunder Tigers really more than enough
