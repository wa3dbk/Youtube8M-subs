in<00:00:04.500> your<00:00:04.680> worksheet<00:00:05.899> sickle-cell<00:00:06.899> anemia<00:00:07.080> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
in your worksheet sickle-cell anemia is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.100 
in your worksheet sickle-cell anemia is
an<00:00:07.890> autosomal<00:00:08.429> recessive<00:00:08.580> disorder<00:00:09.179> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
an autosomal recessive disorder that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.110 
an autosomal recessive disorder that
leads<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.620> sickle<00:00:10.980> shaped<00:00:11.250> red<00:00:11.610> blood<00:00:11.880> cells

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
leads to sickle shaped red blood cells

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
leads to sickle shaped red blood cells
that<00:00:12.780> block<00:00:13.110> blood<00:00:13.469> flow<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.219> not<00:00:14.370> carry

that block blood flow and do not carry
oxygen<00:00:15.240> very<00:00:15.389> well<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> probable

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
oxygen very well what are the probable

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
oxygen very well what are the probable
offspring<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.820> cross<00:00:18.060> between<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.600> carrier

the video and copy that question down

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.480 
the video and copy that question down
continuing<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.689> oh<00:00:25.039> well<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.340> it's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
continuing on oh well we know it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
continuing on oh well we know it's
autosomal<00:00:27.029> recessive<00:00:27.060> because<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:27.840> told<00:00:28.080> us

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
autosomal recessive because they told us

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
autosomal recessive because they told us
right<00:00:28.439> there

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
right there

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
right there
if<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.900> didn't<00:00:31.140> say<00:00:31.230> anything<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:32.130> would

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
if they didn't say anything we would

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
if they didn't say anything we would
know<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.550> autosomal<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.660> figure<00:00:33.930> out

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
know it's autosomal and to figure out

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.330 
know it's autosomal and to figure out
recessive<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.620> dominant<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.070> would<00:00:35.190> just

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
recessive or dominant you would just

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
recessive or dominant you would just
keep<00:00:35.550> reading<00:00:36.140> we<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.530> gene

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
keep reading we know it's one gene

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.170 
keep reading we know it's one gene
because<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.280> talking<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.579> sickle<00:00:39.030> cell

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because we're talking about sickle cell

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.780 
because we're talking about sickle cell
anemia<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> nothing<00:00:40.079> else<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
anemia and nothing else so we know it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.060 
anemia and nothing else so we know it
has<00:00:41.820> two<00:00:42.120> alleles<00:00:42.480> monohybrid<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.680> four

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
has two alleles monohybrid and four

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.380 
has two alleles monohybrid and four
boxes<00:00:44.399> again<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> alleles<00:00:46.590> well

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
boxes again so what are the alleles well

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.170 
boxes again so what are the alleles well
sickle<00:00:48.390> cell<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:49.129> recessive<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.460> whatever<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
sickle cell is recessive so whatever I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
sickle cell is recessive so whatever I
have<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> designate<00:00:51.629> sickle<00:00:52.320> cell<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
have to designate sickle cell to be on

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.049 
have to designate sickle cell to be on
the<00:00:53.070> lowercase<00:00:53.370> letter

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the lowercase letter

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
the lowercase letter
whichever<00:00:54.449> letter<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.780> choose<00:00:55.110> doesn't<00:00:55.920> matter

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
whichever letter I choose doesn't matter

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
whichever letter I choose doesn't matter
what<00:00:56.219> letter<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> choose<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> put

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
what letter I choose just I have to put

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.889 
what letter I choose just I have to put
sickle<00:00:58.079> cell<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.100> lowercase<00:00:59.340> letter<00:00:59.899> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
sickle cell on the lowercase letter this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
sickle cell on the lowercase letter this
time<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> used<00:01:01.500> n<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.070> don't<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.430> why<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.850> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
time I used n I don't know why but just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
time I used n I don't know why but just
chose<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.049> guess<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.589> meant<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> say

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
chose it I guess and I meant to say

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
chose it I guess and I meant to say
normal<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.229> healthy<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.760> again<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.450> end

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
normal but healthy and again little end

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
normal but healthy and again little end
is<00:01:09.900> sickle<00:01:10.290> cell<00:01:10.409> anemia<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:10.830> it's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is sickle cell anemia because it's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
is sickle cell anemia because it's
recessive<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.729> told<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.420> disease<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
recessive they told us the disease is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.080 
recessive they told us the disease is
recessive<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> parents<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
recessive now we go with the parents and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.070 
recessive now we go with the parents and
here<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.479> said<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> parents<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
here they said that the parents are the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
here they said that the parents are the
male<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> carrier<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.430> female<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.820> also

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
male is a carrier and the female is also

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
male is a carrier and the female is also
carrier<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> carer<00:01:25.860> means<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
carrier so to be a carer means that you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
carrier so to be a carer means that you
don't<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> sickness

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
don't have the sickness

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
don't have the sickness
you're<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.460> sick<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:29.850> you're<00:01:30.180> carrying<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you're not sick but you're carrying it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230 
you're not sick but you're carrying it
so<00:01:30.960> you're<00:01:31.110> hiding<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> only<00:01:33.150> way

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so you're hiding it and so the only way

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
so you're hiding it and so the only way
for<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.840> possible<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> be

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
for that to be possible is to be

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880 
for that to be possible is to be
heterozygous<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> big<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.720> n<00:01:36.960> big<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
heterozygous so big and little n big in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
heterozygous so big and little n big in
little<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.329> again<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.750> find<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> sex

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
little in again I then find the sex

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
little in again I then find the sex
cells<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.220> gene<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
cells it's one gene because there's just

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.690 
cells it's one gene because there's just
the<00:01:42.390> letter<00:01:42.570> N<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.170> letter<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.579> ahead

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the letter N one letter so I go ahead

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
the letter N one letter so I go ahead
and<00:01:44.820> segregate<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.970> also<00:01:48.180> said<00:01:48.659> we

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and segregate and then they also said we

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
and segregate and then they also said we
have<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:50.430> ahead<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> punnett

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
have to go ahead and make the punnett

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
have to go ahead and make the punnett
square<00:01:51.720> set<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> sperm

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
square set it up so I put the sperm

there<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> eggs<00:01:54.750> down<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there I put the eggs down there then I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
there I put the eggs down there then I
fill<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.420> offspring<00:01:58.409> again<00:01:59.159> by

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
fill out the offspring again by

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800 
fill out the offspring again by
fertilizing<00:01:59.549> sperm<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.270> egg<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
fertilizing sperm and egg down and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.350

across<00:02:01.700> down<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> cross<00:02:03.560> down<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.829> across

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
across down in a cross down and across

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
across down in a cross down and across
down<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.630> across<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.520> by<00:02:08.520> looking<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
down and across and by looking at this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.869 
down and across and by looking at this
it<00:02:09.629> looks<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> dominant<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it looks like these have the dominant in

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.380 
it looks like these have the dominant in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
front

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.910

therefore<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.020> healthy

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
therefore it's healthy

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.250 
therefore it's healthy
so<00:02:14.250> three<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.550> four<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:14.850> healthy<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.510> one

so three out of four are healthy and one

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.280

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.319 
so for the guy to be not affected well
we<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.830> use<00:03:17.010> X's<00:03:17.489> now<00:03:17.640> it's<00:03:18.090> not

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
we just put letters we we have to put

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.800 
we just put letters we we have to put
the<00:03:21.930> x's<00:03:22.410> or<00:03:22.940> designate<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> sex<00:03:24.299> chromosomes

the x's or designate the sex chromosomes

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.590 
the x's or designate the sex chromosomes

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
because it is sex linked we know guys

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.160 
because it is sex linked we know guys
are<00:03:27.840> XY<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.799> we<00:03:29.670> only<00:03:30.000> put<00:03:30.239> stuff<00:03:30.450> above<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.959> X

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
are XY and we only put stuff above the X

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.729 
are XY and we only put stuff above the X
because<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.130> x-linked<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.530> put

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
because it's x-linked and so we put

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.470 
because it's x-linked and so we put
bixie<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:35.489> they<00:03:35.579> said<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> guy<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.180> not

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
bixie because they said the guy is not

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.069 
bixie because they said the guy is not
affected<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.230> he's<00:03:37.410> healthy<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:38.040> big<00:03:38.220> CY<00:03:39.079> and

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
affected so he's healthy so big CY and

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.069 
affected so he's healthy so big CY and
the<00:03:40.230> female<00:03:40.590> which<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:40.920> xx<00:03:41.700> she's<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> carrier

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the female which is xx she's a carrier

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.840 
the female which is xx she's a carrier
so<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.470> means<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.890> must<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.280> big<00:03:44.489> C<00:03:44.700> and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
so that means you must have a big C and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.360 
so that means you must have a big C and
little<00:03:45.090> C<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.739> then<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.860> go<00:03:47.010> ahead<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.220> make

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
little C and then we go ahead and make

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.780 
little C and then we go ahead and make
the<00:03:47.519> sex<00:03:47.760> house<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.299> again<00:03:48.840> there's<00:03:49.110> only<00:03:49.260> one

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
the sex house and again there's only one

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.740 
the sex house and again there's only one
one<00:03:50.790> gene<00:03:51.030> we're<00:03:51.209> talking<00:03:51.420> about<00:03:51.510> we're

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
one gene we're talking about we're

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.060 
one gene we're talking about we're
talking<00:03:51.840> about<00:03:51.959> color<00:03:52.230> blindness<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.769> we<00:03:52.860> just

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
talking about color blindness so we just

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.220 
talking about color blindness so we just
separate<00:03:54.620> separate<00:03:55.940> then<00:03:56.940> we<00:03:57.090> figure<00:03:57.420> out<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
separate separate then we figure out the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
separate separate then we figure out the
punnett<00:03:58.560> square<00:03:58.829> set<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.820> up<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.540> put<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
punnett square set it up and put the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.920 
punnett square set it up and put the
sperm<00:04:01.140> there<00:04:01.320> put<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> eggs<00:04:01.890> over<00:04:02.040> here<00:04:02.340> and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
sperm there put the eggs over here and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.390 
sperm there put the eggs over here and
then<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.079> go<00:04:04.260> ahead<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.590> fertilizing<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.280> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
then we go ahead and fertilizing at the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.620 
then we go ahead and fertilizing at the
offspring<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:08.000> again<00:04:09.000> that's<00:04:09.209> how<00:04:09.299> we<00:04:09.390> do

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
offspring and again that's how we do

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.599 
offspring and again that's how we do
sex-linked<00:04:10.200> traits<00:04:10.590> notice<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.220> different

sex-linked traits notice it's different

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.199 
sex-linked traits notice it's different
we<00:04:12.030> use<00:04:12.359> X's<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:12.989> Y's<00:04:13.049> or<00:04:13.560> X's<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.549> XS<00:04:14.940> for

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
we use X's and Y's or X's and XS for

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.840 
we use X's and Y's or X's and XS for
with<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:16.010> superscript<00:04:17.010> that's<00:04:17.640> for

with the superscript that's for
sex-linked<00:04:18.299> traits<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.780> then<00:04:19.500> we<00:04:19.620> could<00:04:19.739> go

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
sex-linked traits and then we could go

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.770 
sex-linked traits and then we could go
ahead<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.190> look<00:04:20.280> at<00:04:20.430> this<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.940> what<00:04:21.359> we<00:04:21.479> find

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
ahead and look at this and what we find

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.440 
ahead and look at this and what we find
are<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.160> 0%<00:04:23.160> are<00:04:23.370> colorblind<00:04:23.789> they<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.360> to

are that 0% are colorblind they want to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.510 
are that 0% are colorblind they want to
know<00:04:24.599> if<00:04:24.930> there's<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.380> colorblind<00:04:25.740> female<00:04:26.310> and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
know if there's a colorblind female and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.870 
know if there's a colorblind female and
I<00:04:26.580> look<00:04:26.729> at

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
I look at

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.390 
I look at
the<00:04:26.970> females<00:04:27.590> only<00:04:28.590> look<00:04:28.770> at<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.010> females

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
the females only look at the females

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.680 
the females only look at the females
here<00:04:29.730> when<00:04:29.910> they<00:04:30.000> ask<00:04:30.150> these<00:04:30.330> types<00:04:30.480> of

little<00:05:38.520> R<00:05:38.880> gives<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.420> orange<00:05:39.840> because<00:05:40.260> red

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
little R gives you orange because red

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.010 
little R gives you orange because red
and<00:05:40.710> yellow<00:05:40.830> blend<00:05:41.480> then<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:42.540> figure<00:05:42.810> out<00:05:42.900> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
and yellow blend then I figure out the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.010 
and yellow blend then I figure out the
parents<00:05:43.500> again<00:05:43.950> who's<00:05:44.160> crossing<00:05:44.750> well<00:05:45.750> we

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
parents again who's crossing well we

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.770 
parents again who's crossing well we
look<00:05:46.230> at<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.500> problem<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.040> it<00:05:47.160> says<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:48.570> the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
look at the problem and it says that the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.680 
look at the problem and it says that the
male<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.350> orange<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.610> female<00:05:51.030> is<00:05:51.240> R<00:05:51.300> is

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
male is orange and the female is R is

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.410 
male is orange and the female is R is
yellow<00:05:52.530> so<00:05:53.340> male<00:05:53.640> orange<00:05:54.300> means<00:05:56.150> big<00:05:57.150> R<00:05:57.390> little

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
yellow so male orange means big R little

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.590 
yellow so male orange means big R little
all<00:05:57.870> right<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.320> then<00:05:59.190> yellow<00:05:59.730> means<00:06:00.030> little<00:06:00.360> R

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
all right and then yellow means little R

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.510 
all right and then yellow means little R
little<00:06:00.630> R<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.410> we're<00:06:01.500> gonna<00:06:01.620> cross<00:06:01.860> those<00:06:02.160> go

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
little R so we're gonna cross those go

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.320 
little R so we're gonna cross those go
ahead<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:02.910> segregate<00:06:04.580> go<00:06:05.580> ahead<00:06:05.760> put<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.060> sex

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
ahead and segregate go ahead put the sex

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.150 
ahead and segregate go ahead put the sex
cells<00:06:06.650> down<00:06:07.650> there<00:06:07.950> and<00:06:09.170> then<00:06:10.170> fertilize<00:06:10.740> now

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
cells down there and then fertilize now

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.060

across<00:06:14.430> down<00:06:15.360> across<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:16.590> looks<00:06:16.800> like<00:06:16.950> we<00:06:17.100> get

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
across down across it looks like we get

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.270 
across down across it looks like we get
50%<00:06:17.910> orange<00:06:18.450> 50%<00:06:19.320> yellow<00:06:21.890> this<00:06:22.890> is<00:06:23.070> for

do you do here well we know it's
autosomal<00:06:40.050> because<00:06:40.410> or<00:06:40.530> not

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
autosomal because or not

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.250

don't tell you anything of what it is

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.390 
don't tell you anything of what it is
just<00:06:45.060> figure<00:06:45.360> it's<00:06:45.510> autosomal

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
just figure it's autosomal

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.650 
just figure it's autosomal

we<00:06:48.660> know<00:06:48.780> it's<00:06:48.930> two<00:06:49.140> genes<00:06:49.440> how<00:06:49.620> do<00:06:49.710> I<00:06:49.770> know

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
we know it's two genes how do I know

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.040 
we know it's two genes how do I know
because<00:06:50.250> there's<00:06:50.400> two<00:06:50.550> letters<00:06:50.850> big<00:06:51.150> a<00:06:51.330> I'm

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
because there's two letters big a I'm

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.010 
because there's two letters big a I'm
sorry<00:06:52.200> just<00:06:52.800> a<00:06:53.100> and<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.460> B<00:06:53.700> a<00:06:53.970> a<00:06:54.270> and<00:06:54.690> B<00:06:54.870> are

sorry just a and the B a a and B are

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.100 
sorry just a and the B a a and B are
used<00:06:55.230> so<00:06:55.380> two<00:06:55.590> genes<00:06:55.830> now<00:06:56.040> four<00:06:56.460> alleles

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
used so two genes now four alleles

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.260 
used so two genes now four alleles

big a little a Big B little B and then

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.350 
big a little a Big B little B and then
we<00:07:04.260> figure<00:07:04.530> out<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:04.740> parents<00:07:05.220> so<00:07:05.490> they

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
we figure out the parents so they

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.610 
we figure out the parents so they
already<00:07:06.540> gave<00:07:06.780> us<00:07:06.960> the<00:07:07.080> parents<00:07:07.440> in<00:07:07.530> the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
already gave us the parents in the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.230 
already gave us the parents in the
problem<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.870> then<00:07:10.740> that<00:07:11.640> was<00:07:11.790> already<00:07:11.970> stated

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
problem and then that was already stated

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.600 
problem and then that was already stated
there<00:07:12.510> that's<00:07:12.720> easy<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.260> then<00:07:13.950> this<00:07:14.400> time

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
there that's easy and then this time

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.040 
there that's easy and then this time
because<00:07:14.970> there's<00:07:15.120> two<00:07:15.300> genes<00:07:15.570> we<00:07:15.750> don't<00:07:15.930> just

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
because there's two genes we don't just

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.560 
because there's two genes we don't just
segregate<00:07:16.620> we<00:07:17.280> have<00:07:17.460> to<00:07:17.580> do<00:07:17.700> foil<00:07:17.970> because<00:07:18.450> of

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
segregate we have to do foil because of

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.080

time<00:07:42.750> keep<00:07:43.140> all<00:07:43.290> the<00:07:43.410> A's<00:07:43.560> on<00:07:43.800> the<00:07:43.890> left<00:07:44.100> side

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
time keep all the A's on the left side

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.010 
time keep all the A's on the left side
and<00:07:44.580> the<00:07:44.670> B's<00:07:44.820> on<00:07:45.030> the<00:07:45.090> right<00:07:45.270> side<00:07:45.510> because<00:07:45.750> of

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 
and the B's on the right side because of

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.760 
and the B's on the right side because of
alphabetical<00:07:46.740> order<00:07:47.040> and<00:07:48.200> then<00:07:49.200> you<00:07:49.350> go<00:07:49.470> ahead

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:49.770 
alphabetical order and then you go ahead

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.020 
alphabetical order and then you go ahead
and<00:07:49.950> fill<00:07:50.190> out<00:07:50.220> the<00:07:50.520> punnett<00:07:50.850> square<00:07:51.090> and

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.030 
and fill out the punnett square and

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.310 
and fill out the punnett square and
pause<00:07:54.030> the<00:07:54.210> video<00:07:54.360> if<00:07:54.630> you<00:07:54.720> want<00:07:54.930> to<00:07:54.990> see<00:07:55.140> some

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.320 
pause the video if you want to see some

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.750 
pause the video if you want to see some
of<00:07:55.440> the<00:07:55.500> steps<00:07:55.770> I'm<00:07:55.980> just<00:07:56.190> going<00:07:56.370> quickly

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:56.760 
of the steps I'm just going quickly

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.540 
of the steps I'm just going quickly
because<00:07:57.120> of<00:07:57.240> time<00:07:57.450> and<00:07:58.260> then<00:07:58.980> we<00:07:59.130> go<00:07:59.310> to<00:07:59.370> see

00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.550 
because of time and then we go to see

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.900 
because of time and then we go to see
how<00:07:59.700> many<00:07:59.850> genotypes<00:08:00.390> there<00:08:00.600> are<00:08:01.220> well<00:08:02.220> that's

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:02.910 
how many genotypes there are well that's

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.300 
how many genotypes there are well that's
one<00:08:03.210> type<00:08:03.450> of<00:08:03.480> genotype<00:08:04.110> here's<00:08:04.800> another<00:08:05.040> kind

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.310 
one type of genotype here's another kind

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.150 
one type of genotype here's another kind
that's<00:08:06.180> another<00:08:06.450> kind<00:08:06.720> that's<00:08:07.500> another<00:08:07.770> card

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 
that's another kind that's another card

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.730 
that's another kind that's another card
that's<00:08:09.090> another<00:08:09.330> card<00:08:09.630> and<00:08:09.870> that's<00:08:10.410> another

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 
that's another card and that's another

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.470 
that's another card and that's another
card<00:08:11.100> notice<00:08:11.790> I<00:08:11.880> didn't<00:08:12.120> circle<00:08:12.390> these

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:12.480 
card notice I didn't circle these

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.420 
card notice I didn't circle these
because<00:08:12.900> these<00:08:13.110> are<00:08:13.170> similar<00:08:13.620> that<00:08:13.800> one<00:08:14.010> these

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:14.430 
because these are similar that one these

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.400 
because these are similar that one these
are<00:08:14.640> similar<00:08:14.850> to<00:08:15.030> these<00:08:15.150> so<00:08:16.050> in<00:08:16.200> reality

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.410 
are similar to these so in reality

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.210 
are similar to these so in reality
there's<00:08:16.770> only<00:08:16.950> six<00:08:17.280> different<00:08:17.490> genotypes
