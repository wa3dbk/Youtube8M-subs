00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.480
 but Martin starts a new 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.500
 preseason and I imagine that you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.210
 they start just as they swell with the 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.490
 same expectations or even more because 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.790
 the team returned to first division if 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 not the expectations now obviously not 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.160
 I know if it is as high as the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.650
 fan but ours is more than 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.300
 clear that we want to fight the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.649
 championship make many points for not 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.899
 have problems the subject of the average and 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.000
 we have a whole year this semester we are going 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.100
 to aim high is the possibility 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.300
 to classify lost cups 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.670
 champions to have a place in the final 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.260
 so with a lot of desire 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 do you think that beyond the players that 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.010
 they have gone that has been players of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.370
 much importance and hierarchy the establishment 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.900
 is trained I lived with the level 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.890
 necessary to be able to aim high 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.380
 in first vision also 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 I am convinced with work 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.880
 we know we have to improve things 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.380
 movements and others but has a 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.690
 very large potential the players that 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.840
 River river are many and good so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.520
 I believe that MatÃ­as and his body stopped 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 they are going to remove it try to squeeze 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.320
 all the best I have a very stop 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 brave get up maybe at the worst 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.460
 moment of your story as you imagine that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 is going to be this first division so 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.860
 complicated and with as much pressure as it was 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.030
 the last tournament 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 I think it was a very hard year 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 and I really felt that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 backpack that weight the requirement of the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 obligation that we had to leave 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.150
 champion or ascend yes or yes and then 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.729
 it was like we played against us 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.390
 they have to be quiet and a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 hard year against many things and so all 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.940
 we achieved it to new champions and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.299
 we meet the goal now we are 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.590
 We feel very happy to achieve the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.920
 goal of being in the first of 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.259
 go back to where you are from and from 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.789
 there from now on more trying to do 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.070
 foundations so that they do not return to 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.679
 make things happen to what do you think 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.860
 correspond corresponded that pressure and 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.660
 that backpack you were just talking to a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.220
 computer - level issue or perhaps 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.580
 fell a little bit to the pressure and the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 anxiety of the people of yourself 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.570
 against ourselves we knew that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 we had to ascend yes or yes shriver 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.810
 national time I went champion or ascend if 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.880
 the only way was to meet the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.140
 objective then as 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.300
 are going the dates would be a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.770
 atypical championship and three more teams 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.020
 also do the amount of point that 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.850
 did they do eight years that they did not see 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.550
 nationals well then I was very 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.280
 difficult we won cattle to others 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.370
 we could win others 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.770
 the championship was given to the last date 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.290
 so imagine what we suffer 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.590
 and what it cost us then I think that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.240
 with that pressure or that backpack not in this 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.370
 moment we no longer feel the debts 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.190
 like we have more freedom and we 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.630
 we feel much more lighter for the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.640
 time to play not because we have 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 players very good foot and in this 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.510
 semester we have not played as well as 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.430
 how can this team play 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.950
 so I think that being in first 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.110
 does not give the possibility to exploit the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.910
 potential that we have that is going to be a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.840
 fundamental factor for you to arrive 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.120
 maybe I can become more colorful and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.300
 The theme here is to earn a point 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.880
 and if there is a chance as I told you 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.420
 fight to enter a cup and fight the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.490
 championship 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.370
 because the showy will be aside or 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.840
 here in Argentina can hopefully you can 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.610
 play well win 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.650
 it would be ideal for everyone we like all the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.650
 football but we need to take out 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 point on a personal level as the year that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.959
 He passed 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.510
 the fan asked you and he claims you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.610
 constantly and perhaps during the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.739
 last semester he did not play with you 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.530
 the continuity that you would have wanted as 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.510
 You saw yourself this year perhaps from titular 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.690
 have a less continuity if it was a year 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.810
 atypical 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.750
 in the end I enjoyed it with the objective 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.010
 fulfilled but not personal start-up and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.110
 the preseason with a suspension 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.520
 above and the first date I did not play 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.190
 then like all preseason 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.990
 I had to start winning in 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.090
 a place from 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.820
 when the most difficult championship began 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.380
 already with the armed team besides now not 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.880
 now we all start from scratch 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.290
 we have the same chances and good 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.020
 obviously I have to improve things 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.850
 is what we have now and I'm going to 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.220
 try to embarrass more diego 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.080
 for when choosing the equipment what 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.080
 I put it in doubt
