00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:12.300
 so hello everyone I would like to tell you about 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 how to make yourself windows 8 tiles 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.529
 who thinks that here goes according to the standard 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.910
 Here's a picture that's such tiles 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.390
 then all the type remains it forever on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.539
 really no them you can customize 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 like absolutely for example 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:37.620
 call the group dart plan let them 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 there will be a Chinese like this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:52.489
 bloom here and here call here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:58.649
 group and you here 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 played here actually everything here so 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.210
 now it looks like this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.600
 if we look, you can find any 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 application example we remove the application 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.479
 Kamtasia Studio and transfer to the initial 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 screen 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 here she appeared somewhere here now 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.920
 let's see here actually kamtaziya studio 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.369
 resize 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.840
 and transfer it over here 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:47.680
 small application 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:51.620
 You can also change it with any application. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.170
 the size is small like this 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.670
 so for example whatever you want absolutely 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.020
 any tiles 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:07.670
 anybody go personalization like that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.770
 and choose any background that we have 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:19.780
 There are a lot of backgrounds presented so 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:23.290
 Think here how many 4 on 20 this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.240
 little really is a lot 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:32.360
 given the fact that just such a set 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:36.050
 no background no such here for example 100 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.570
 here choose any color like this no 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.380
 red as tom throw eyes here 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.730
 blue 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:51.590
 and choose here what other objects 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.810
 yellow for example that is, we did it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.810
 Here is such a scheme 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.890
 options here 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.530
 personalization that is from there any so 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.760
 set up like so although the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.440
 have swapped tiles in places 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.080
 changed the background and we have it all 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.900
 will arrive has acquired a new look 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.060
 that is, on this I want to finish what 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.240
 windows 8 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.240
 limitless possibilities
