 and here they write it again 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.120
 and in case you do not know with your password 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.120
 for neutral suggestion 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.960
 and we give the next 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.150
 good as you see, an account was created 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.439
 local 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.439
 I do not eat it like we opened it 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.920

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.860
 and they removed it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.550
 and as you see in the part of here it appears 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.520
 another account as you can see is the name 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.470
 well I 'm going back to mine 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.140
 and if they think it did not look good or something like that 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.430
 As we are going to remove it, we give the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 part of here and appears to change the type 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.760
 of account or remove what you want to delete 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.950
 good as the account will be loaded 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.980
 will load as 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.590
 as the computer is going to restart it goes 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 and he left and then he starts again 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.940
 as 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.540
 as a start and you'll have your new 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.069
 account 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.069
 but we do not give it away 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:06.360
 and appears to go down is this window will 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.360
 we delete account and data 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.680
