00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
a bench test to see if I could verify it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
basically what Rob told me was on the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
basically what Rob told me was on the
bench<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:05.909> noticed<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.950> fast

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
bench he noticed that with a lot of fast

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.140 
bench he noticed that with a lot of fast
pitch<00:01:08.880> pumps<00:01:10.040> he<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.189> having<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.670> brownout

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
pitch pumps he was having some brownout

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.340 
pitch pumps he was having some brownout
issues<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.549> he's<00:01:14.549> worried<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
issues and he's worried that the that it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.550 
issues and he's worried that the that it
may<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.530> design<00:01:16.950> flaw<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> servo<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
may be design flaw with the servo and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.990 
may be design flaw with the servo and
since<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.100> new<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> only

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
since these are so new and the only

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
since these are so new and the only
other<00:01:21.270> people<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:22.049> running<00:01:22.380> these

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
other people we know running these

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.270 
other people we know running these
servos<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.220> using<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.270> ex<00:01:24.540> packs<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.860> asked

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
servos are using our ex packs they asked

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.149 
servos are using our ex packs they asked
me<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> quick<00:01:27.060> bench<00:01:27.420> test<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.979> what

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
me to do a quick bench test and see what

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.690 
me to do a quick bench test and see what
mine<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.579> doing<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> say<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> was

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
mine were doing and I have to say I was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.140 
mine were doing and I have to say I was
I'm<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.329> concerned<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> results<00:01:35.220> as

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I'm a little concerned at the results as

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.550 
I'm a little concerned at the results as
you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.110> load<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you can see here with no load on the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
you can see here with no load on the
blades<00:01:37.880> I'm<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.439> no<00:01:40.439> problem<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.810> now

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
blades I'm it's no problem at all now

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
blades I'm it's no problem at all now
watch<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.619> happens<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.430> I'm<00:01:44.549> gonna<00:01:44.670> try<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
watch what happens and I'm gonna try to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
watch what happens and I'm gonna try to
do<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.149> without<00:01:45.270> being<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.750> camera<00:01:46.170> watch

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
do this without being the camera watch

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.120 
do this without being the camera watch
this<00:01:47.250> servo<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.390> my<00:01:48.770> aileron<00:01:49.770> left

well<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:52.950> hand<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> blade<00:01:53.610> up

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
well I'm got my hand on the blade up

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.020 
well I'm got my hand on the blade up
lying<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.390> bit<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.570> pressure

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.810 

see<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.150> servo<00:01:59.510> stop<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.490> give<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.790> a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
see that servo stop now if I give it a

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.190 
see that servo stop now if I give it a
few<00:02:01.970> seconds<00:02:02.830> snow<00:02:03.830> load<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.960> eventually

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
few seconds snow load it eventually

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.639 
few seconds snow load it eventually
comes<00:02:06.500> back<00:02:06.800> slowly<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:07.850> surely<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:09.410> comes

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
comes back slowly but surely it comes

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.190 
comes back slowly but surely it comes
back<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.280> they<00:02:10.520> catch<00:02:10.760> us<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:14.200> needless

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
back and they catch us up but needless

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.280 
back and they catch us up but needless
to<00:02:15.380> say<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:16.390> think<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.510> might<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> bit<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
to say I think we might have a bit of a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.060 
to say I think we might have a bit of a
problem<00:02:18.530> with<00:02:18.860> our<00:02:19.010> static<00:02:19.460> servos<00:02:19.880> here<00:02:20.120> guys

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
problem with our static servos here guys

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.540 
problem with our static servos here guys
I<00:02:22.100> don't<00:02:22.610> know<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.330> load<00:02:23.630> issue<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:25.040> if

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
I don't know if it's a load issue if if

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
I don't know if it's a load issue if if
it's<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> brownout<00:02:26.090> because<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.900> these<00:02:27.590> guys

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
it's a brownout because the these guys

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's a brownout because the these guys
are<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.130> fast<00:02:28.430> these<00:02:28.670> guys<00:02:28.850> are<00:02:29.060> rated

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
are so fast these guys are rated

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
are so fast these guys are rated
something<00:02:29.840> insane<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.680> have<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> box<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.880> E<00:02:31.970> like

ridiculously fast and torquey but I

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.410 
ridiculously fast and torquey but I
think<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.870> sounding<00:02:48.380> like<00:02:48.790> back<00:02:49.790> may<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.240> be

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
think it's sounding like back may not be

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.130 
think it's sounding like back may not be
enough

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
enough

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.970

I<00:02:57.680> figured<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.910> way<00:02:59.030> JC<00:02:59.390> flies<00:02:59.959> if<00:03:00.200> he

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
I figured if the way JC flies if he

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.350

could<00:03:00.470> beat<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.010> crap<00:03:01.700> out<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:01.970> them<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.209> be

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
could beat the crap out of them and be

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.670 
could beat the crap out of them and be
