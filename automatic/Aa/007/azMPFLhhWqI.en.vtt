00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.189 
just showing you a another weapon i made
because<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.889> noticed<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.809> Angie<00:00:15.809> moco<00:00:16.170> has

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
because I noticed that Angie moco has

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.810 
because I noticed that Angie moco has
been<00:00:16.470> coming<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> lot<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.160> repeater

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
been coming out with a lot of repeater

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.310 
been coming out with a lot of repeater
type<00:00:20.119> weapons<00:00:21.119> recently<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.080> thought<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
type weapons recently and I thought that

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.099 
type weapons recently and I thought that
was<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:24.000> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> annoyed<00:00:24.539> me<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.930> because

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
was that kind of annoyed me just because

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
was that kind of annoyed me just because
they<00:00:25.619> were<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:26.340> were<00:00:26.400> doing<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.119> well<00:00:27.150> before

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
they were they were doing so well before

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
they were they were doing so well before
with<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:28.920> creative<00:00:29.189> weapons

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
with your little more creative weapons

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
with your little more creative weapons
now<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> seems<00:00:30.810> they're<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.199> falling<00:00:31.380> back

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
now that seems they're just falling back

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
now that seems they're just falling back
on<00:00:31.740> some<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> basic<00:00:32.579> ideas<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> one

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
on some of the basic ideas so this one

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.900 
on some of the basic ideas so this one
uh<00:00:37.610> I've<00:00:38.610> called<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.420> weapon<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> Viper<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
uh I've called this weapon the Viper and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.860 
uh I've called this weapon the Viper and
it<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> cross

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it is a it's a it's kind of a cross

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
it is a it's a it's kind of a cross
between<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.320> sniper<00:00:46.800> rifle<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> crossbow

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
between a sniper rifle and a crossbow

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
between a sniper rifle and a crossbow
and<00:00:48.710> I'll<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:51.590> move<00:00:52.590> around

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and I'll just do a little move around

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.330 
and I'll just do a little move around
here<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:55.620> green

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
here and as you can see it's green

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
here and as you can see it's green
because<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.329> trying<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> think

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
because I was just trying to think

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.510 
because I was just trying to think
colors<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.530> haven't<00:00:58.710> used<00:00:59.039> yet<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
colors that they haven't used yet I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
colors that they haven't used yet I
thought<00:01:00.480> green<00:01:00.750> looked<00:01:00.930> pretty<00:01:01.170> good<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thought green looked pretty good for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.340 
thought green looked pretty good for
especially<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> sniper<00:01:02.340> rifle<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
especially for a sniper rifle so what it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
especially for a sniper rifle so what it
does<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.610> caught<00:01:06.450> creates<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:08.780> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
does is it caught creates then it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.440 
does is it caught creates then it
charges<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.290> energy<00:01:10.710> particle<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
charges up energy particle in this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.710 
charges up energy particle in this
little<00:01:12.720> chamber<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.619> as<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
little chamber right here and as you

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
little chamber right here and as you
load<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.830> end<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> wait

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
load it up or an end and as you wait

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.160 
load it up or an end and as you wait
it'll<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.330> charge<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.110> more

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it'll the charge will get more and more

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200 
it'll the charge will get more and more
powerful<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:23.909> have

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
powerful but you can do is you can have

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.109 
powerful but you can do is you can have
it<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.409> repetitive<00:01:26.189> blast<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it on a on a repetitive blast if you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.249 
it on a on a repetitive blast if you
want<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.750> only<00:01:27.840> shoot<00:01:28.229> small<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:30.259> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
want but it will only shoot small I it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
want but it will only shoot small I it
will<00:01:31.380> only<00:01:31.470> shoot<00:01:31.740> small<00:01:31.950> bursts<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> keep

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
will only shoot small bursts if you keep

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
will only shoot small bursts if you keep
it<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.090> repetitive<00:01:33.420> whereas<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.619> wait<00:01:34.829> for

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it on repetitive whereas if you wait for

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.450 
it on repetitive whereas if you wait for
a<00:01:35.189> while<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:36.990> it'll<00:01:37.710> charge<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.280> more

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
a while it will it'll charge it for more

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
a while it will it'll charge it for more
powerful<00:01:38.909> powerful<00:01:39.210> shot<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.619> crossbow

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
powerful powerful shot and the crossbow

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
powerful powerful shot and the crossbow
when<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.280> hits<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.579> opponent<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.000> kills<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
when it hits an opponent if it kills the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.280 
when it hits an opponent if it kills the
opponent<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.649> through<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.399> will

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
opponent it will go through it will

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.719 
opponent it will go through it will
pierce<00:01:49.290> through<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> opponent<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.189> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pierce through the opponent in can

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.590 
pierce through the opponent in can
possibly<00:01:51.240> hit<00:01:51.390> another<00:01:51.659> opponent<00:01:51.899> behind<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
possibly hit another opponent behind it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
possibly hit another opponent behind it
so<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.720> thinking<00:01:55.049> considering<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so it's thinking considering that it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.780 
so it's thinking considering that it
won't<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.540> any<00:01:57.689> ammo<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.649> assuming<00:01:58.790> that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
won't have any ammo so I'm assuming that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.389 
won't have any ammo so I'm assuming that
they<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> reload

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
they would have a it would have a reload

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
they would have a it would have a reload
time<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> stat<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.079> could<00:02:04.229> upgrade

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
time as a stat that you could upgrade

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
time as a stat that you could upgrade
where<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> decreases<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> time<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.329> takes<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
where it decreases the time it takes to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.820 
where it decreases the time it takes to
charge<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> max<00:02:07.530> shot<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:10.110> also<00:02:10.379> damage

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
charge up to a max shot and also damage

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.160 
charge up to a max shot and also damage
and<00:02:11.220> rate<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.150> fire

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and rate of fire

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.150 
and rate of fire
and<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:15.510> would<00:02:15.599> also<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.990> enhanced<00:02:16.380> zoom

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and it would also have enhanced zoom

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.580 
and it would also have enhanced zoom
function<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> stuff<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.560> it
