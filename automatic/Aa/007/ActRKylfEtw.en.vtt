 hello everyone this is my first video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.799
 When I'm a member until 1990 and this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.130
 is my top 10 of the best fights in the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 web 2011 in the position number 10 is the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
 fight beyond china and 100 pong in money 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.789
 In due 2011 this fight was very long and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.980
 there was a lot already I see but nevertheless 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 it was entertaining the fight was about 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 it was the last day of punk in the eu and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 it was dinner he lost the title he would be fired 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.769
 at the end of the fight if I was 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.750
 applying his st efe settle but arrives 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 a vince mcmahon and john laurinaitis a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 interrupt the fight but dinner hits 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.440
 alhaurín alicia what dinner returns to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 ring punk applies his gps to win the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 fight and so take the title of the web 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.960
 with him 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.770
 but nevertheless john dinner was not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.050
 fired and tam returned to the wwf in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 put number 9 is the randy fight 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 orton versus cristian in over the limit 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 this rivalry occurred when orton was 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.390
 changed to smackdown and got the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 heavy world championship shortly after 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.140
 that cristian got it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 well they gave themselves with everything and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 because in the fight , Othón predominated but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 as much as cristian tried 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 recover orton gave him and gave him 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.800
 until with an ere ko he could defeat 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.229
 cristian and remain the champion 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.649
 heavy global but like most 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.410
 we know cristian did not stay with this one anymore 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.450
 that cristian would declare his revenge on 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.640
 the number 8 place this is the fight of 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.410
 elimination chamber draw the one that will win 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.770
 that fight would be rival to the miz in 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.750
 germany 27 everyone got really hard on 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.149
 special punk and ottón since they were 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.250
 rivals for then the fight turned 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.740
 interesting when morrison went up 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.810
 above the cage and finally threw 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.539
 last participants standing were john 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 dinner and cm punk but dinner arrangement to bread 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.710
 with an attitude adjustment on the part 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 metallic ring that thus beating 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.470
 punk 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.030
 getting into the number 1 contender 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.640
 for germany 27 against the mid 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.070
 the number 7 position is taken triple h 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.170
 against pm punk at night of champions 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.479
 this rivalry became interesting 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.570
 when tank insult to triple h in 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 stripes and came out to this fight this fight me 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.069
 It seemed very striking as it was a no 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.370
 they go red match and if triple h lost already 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.709
 it would not be the boss they hit the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.569
 end of the fight intervene denis hart 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.200
 truck but punk and triple h are the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.760
 removed with pedigree and gts 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 then the win appears to tease trying 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.350
 that triple h lost to be able to 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.450
 be the new boss when they would have 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.630
 could get rid of denis and andruw is 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.580
 it seems that mine better known as 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.130
 diesel but triple h hits him with the mallet 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.410
 in the face and as the final part of the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.620
 fight was when triple h managed to make him 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 the pedigree to punk and thus win the combat 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.630
 the number 6 place is once v 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.600
 s alberto del río v scm punk on the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.910
 inacer dinner and bread began attacking 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.670
 of the river but then they fight among themselves 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.470
 the fight was very interesting since it was 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.050
 the first triple threat in the cell 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.900
 infernal the final part was when 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.030
 he applied the river's ctf but his 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.890
 assistant ricardo rodríguez removes the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 keys to the referee and goes to help 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 your dinner boss makes you an adjustment of 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.550
 attitude to ricardo but the river hits him 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.610
 with a tube and leave it out of the cage 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.250
 of the river hits bread with a tube and so 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.370
 wins the title of the web the river sena se 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.230
 he hits the ring furious but then 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.330
 they close the cell but with the miz jarre 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.670
 truck inside and they start hitting 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.740
 to all and to the arbitrators all 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.350
 fighters come to the rescue next to the 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.660
 police the police pulled out of my lock 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.420
 tour but triple h angrily hits them and 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.100
 there the event ends it's said that john 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.220
 laurinaitis was the cause of the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.920
 uproar with the miz and r-truth the post 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.460
 number 5 they take him two fights xd xd 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.830
 xd xdddd both are in summerslam and are 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.010
 randy orton versus cristian and john dinner 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.170
 versus cmp both fights were very 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.120
 entertaining but that of orton and cristian 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.920
 was the most violent of the event since 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.110
 it was a red match and not for 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.480
 course won orton with a super erreka 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.690
 or from the third string impacting on 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.790
 a stair 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.160
 orton became the new champion 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.470
 heavy world 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.960
 and the second of this place is the subject 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.000
 and punk was very similar to the fight of 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.820
 mong lin should just that this was for the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.910
 undisputed champion of the wwf and with 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.130
 triple h of special referee I did not like 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.080
 the way he won bread because it was for 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.660
 triple h error after completed 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.300
 the fight appears kevin like that hits punk 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.370
 already being weak punk appears from the river 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.300
 with his money in the bank briefcase and he 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.730
 becomes the new champion of the wwf 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.770
 place number 4 is john dinner v / s 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.560
 of mill bs john morrison in extreme 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.810
 rules the fight was in this the coffee and it 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.790
 they gave as they should there were no alliances and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.710
 Halfway through the fight, r-truth appears 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.480
 hitting dinner but most of all to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.580
 morrison the strange thing was that I do not touch 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.280
 ademys thus being morrison knocked out and 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.500
 I would define it at dinner and meet the meat 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.510
 He was going to escape but dinner he picked up and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.340
 makes a super attitude adjustment from the 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.420
 third string and so wins the championship 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.120
 from the wwf the number 3 post is what 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.850
 they carry cmp versus alberto del río versus 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.200
 of I felt the if the fight was fight 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.710
 stairs and the river and mid allied 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.630
 but not giving up the river and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.150
 the miz fought and that's what led 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.280
 went to the recovery of punk then 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.980
 pan recovers but ricardo rodríguez 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.140
 the wife to the ladder after so much 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.630
 Effort is loose but from blackbird wife to 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.180
 the corner go disarms the post and 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.340
 He clears the trap and applies a gps to 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.060
 the miz and climb to catch his championship 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.100
 from the wwf, the number 2 position 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.980
 they wear john dinner and the rock versus me 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.930
 legit treat survivor series was a great 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.390
 event since it was the return of the rock 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.940
 to the ring but dinner and the rock is not 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.800
 they went well at the end of the fight dinner 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.260
 he gives the relief to the rock and he applies a 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.840
 button to give truck and a nudge from the town 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.090
 of mijas and winning the fight at the end 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.250
 dinner and the rock are left talking but 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.200
 When dinner was going to leave the rock 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.180
 applies a rock bottom and told dinner 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.820
 that will only be a taste of what you 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.860
 clouds make him the No. hobby 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.700
 you get a beta keruve that 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.240
 triple H 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.890
 germany 27 in a goal of suárez match 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.630
 this fight was in my opinion the best 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.880
 of the year since it was the return of two 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.920
 big 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.260
 ww you do not know who dominated the fight at 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.880
 principle since it was very evenly 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.040
 they gave silletazos and also each one 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680
 he applied his keys but nevertheless 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.690
 none fell into the account of three 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.550
 when triple h zagal more or undertaker 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.650
 Surprises him with some doors of 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.110
 hell and after a while triple h 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.200
 he surrendered and undertaker remained unbeaten in 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.240
 olés lehman already with a 19 to 0 many 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.190
 Thank you for your attention and remember that 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.590
 it's my first video loquendo so it's 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.500
 very simple when you have experience 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.350
 will surprise you with much better videos if 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.480

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.450
 You do not know where to see them pay-per-view 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.980

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.350
