00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.340
 and well just how about friends of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.690
 youtube I bring you a new video and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 Well, as they had seen in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 title this let's learn how to do 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.369
 a farm of es line 100% effective 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.369
 Well, the first point they have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.290
 that having this in mind is the seed 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 from the map where they are 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.120
 let's say that building or just 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 of the new map that will create the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.579
 second point is to have the coordinate of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.460
 where are we say that building the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 just inside the map the coordinate 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.809
 this one or simply where they go to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 build or where they appeared on a map 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.789
 new and good because those are the two 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 points that will need the points of 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 what is being a sheet of paper in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.839
 this then simply see those of the xbox or 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.839
 or write them down on something to be able 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.570
 do the the next step that is is the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.160
 link computer that I will leave in 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 the description of the video only 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.960
 click on the link to be able to do 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.810
 our farm is lines and well 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.110
 this page what he will do is this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.860
 let's say you'll find 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.100
 the backs of the slim to be able 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.960
 this because in order to know where they are and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.760
 well to be able to make the slam farm good 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.760
 I see them right now on the computer 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.790
 and good friends of youtube there is no being 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.000
 here in what has been the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 computer this will have to have the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.159
 hand as I told you at the beginning of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.500
 video the seed and the coordinate of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.409
 where they appear when they generate the map or 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.740
 just where where they stayed in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.810
 well on a map and has created good this one 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
 what has been the seed will have 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 to write down where it says worth it or 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 world seed this one in my case it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 minecraft flame 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.170
 in my case it's called minecraft and good 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.500
 because in the x they will have to write down the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.930
 coordinate of the x that is 240 and in the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.110
 zeta as they will write down the coordinate of the 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.820
 zeta which is 242 ok we give you enter and this 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.200
 before that we have to give him a 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.910
 tenth for us to load the seed and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 well then there we give go green another 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.220
 time and good this will have to appear 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.740
 here to the middle of 240 and 240 in our 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.950
 coordinate in this case here changes us 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.590
 to the z 240 because then it is half of the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.230
 map where we appear good because 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.080
 that we have this this we will see in 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 our map in our shows that 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.190
 we have here and that's where they will appear 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.840
 the slams that are the green squares 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.520
 we will locate what is the green box 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 that we have closer in this case is 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.670
 this one of 208 this the x and zeta 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.560
 It's 240 and well then, since we have this 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.959
 the cross in the middle of this picture to 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.980
 we will notice the numbers that appear at the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:18.700
 right of the cross that is this 20 8 or 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:21.700
 208 240 to 224 and 256 good since 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.000
 let's have that this one we'll notice again 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.620
 and we will go to what has been 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.780
 our xbox already in the man class of the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.850
 xbox good since you do not have or is 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.850
 right now I see them on the xbox 360 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.269
 and well then we're back to the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.569
 what is the computer this time 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.230
 as you see here I am in the coordinate 240 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.760
 or 142 that we noticed on the computer and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.810
 good this what we have to do 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 is now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.099
 in the coordinates that the cross gave us 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.910
 that are on the right we have them 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.069
 go for them to say that for 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.430
 make it the slams farm in this case 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.550
 I already have let's say that made or done in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.000
 the room where the slams are, let me 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.140
 going there is 208 in this case 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.140
 it's down 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:25.360
 the turbo element is for 208 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.120
 to 240 that is up to 240 ok here 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.070
 we're 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.110
 and well, as you can see, it's down here as 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.020
 They see already had done what is being 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.530
 the song this and good because here below there is 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.600
 is lines this and good 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.030
 I'm going to leave what is being 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.310
 the image of how they should see it 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.050
 this the first two coordinates that 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.790
 they will see in the on the cross when they 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.970
 appear is the X and the zeta ok and the y 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.740
 when you say an atheist and there to the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.470
 right and two other coordinates more 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.510
 these are where the square ends in 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.199
 this case as you see the first two mine 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.060
 are 208 240 and where the painting ends 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.350
 are the other two coordinates that are 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.699
 224 256 and well, that's just where they end up 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.050
 diagonally and already the masses in the square 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.090
 and well, I think this would be all 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.680
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.930
 just see the coordinates of the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.139
 cross that marks them and when they put the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.330
 seed this and good as well as them 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.610
 I repeat, I think it would be all 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.530
 height, they have to do it 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.610
 three to get the two in 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.990
 big 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.909
 and well, they have to put 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.069
 lighting so that no monstrous 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.670
 you know how they do thanks is 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.800
 live 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.690
 this good then how do I turn them 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.500
 repeat the second coordinate that comes 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.140
 after the tour is this is that from 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.080
 a corner and the first coordinate that 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.180
 comes to the side of the cross is this 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.160
 another corner here, not where 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.660
 we dig first and well then to 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.600
 tell them they are going to be appearing 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.700
 This slams is in two frames 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.800
 green together is much better because 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.060
 there they have the biggest farm and 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.130
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.990
 if you liked give me a like subscribe 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.390
 for more videos and see you until the 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.390
 next video we'll see you bye 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.610
