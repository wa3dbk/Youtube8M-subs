00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:55.180 
do one more down so all together right
now<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.180> sounds<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:48.320> 03<00:02:50.720> 07<00:02:52.730> 52<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
now it sounds like this 03 07 52 and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.590 
now it sounds like this 03 07 52 and
it's<00:02:56.190> okay<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.640> take<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> little<00:02:57.060> bit<00:02:57.209> slow

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
it's okay if you take a little bit slow

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's okay if you take a little bit slow
because<00:02:58.130> if<00:02:59.130> you're<00:02:59.370> not<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.670> good<00:02:59.850> at<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
because if you're not that good at it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.360 
because if you're not that good at it
yet<00:03:00.180> let's<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:02.150> then<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.200> then<00:03:05.070> what<00:03:05.250> you

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
yet let's get and then you then what you

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.840 
yet let's get and then you then what you
do<00:03:05.489> next<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.090> hit<00:03:06.299> another<00:03:06.630> open<00:03:07.110> note<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
do next is you hit another open note and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.770 
do next is you hit another open note and
open<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:10.190> 32<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:14.630> instead<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.660> hitting

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
open and then 32 and instead of hitting

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.259 
open and then 32 and instead of hitting
the<00:03:16.110> zero<00:03:16.459> instead<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.670> hitting<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.030> high<00:03:18.239> note

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the zero instead of hitting a high note

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.890 
the zero instead of hitting a high note
are<00:03:19.519> an<00:03:20.519> open<00:03:20.970> note<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.450> e<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.980> lehigh<00:03:23.610> then<00:03:24.180> go

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
are an open note on e the lehigh then go

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.840 
are an open note on e the lehigh then go
down<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.890> hidden<00:03:26.100> open<00:03:26.340> notes<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.670> be

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
down to be and hidden open notes on be

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.110 
down to be and hidden open notes on be
so<00:03:27.360> that's<00:03:28.140> all<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.459> all<00:03:29.579> together<00:03:29.760> it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
so that's all I know so all together it

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:42.080 
so that's all I know so all together it
sounds<00:03:30.269> like<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.799> as<00:03:41.160> soon<00:03:41.610> as<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.880> learn

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
sounds like this and as soon as I learn

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.010 
sounds like this and as soon as I learn
more<00:03:42.390> all<00:03:43.010> closer
