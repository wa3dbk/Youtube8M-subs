of that complexity out of the way and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.570 
of that complexity out of the way and
makes<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.630> super<00:00:25.050> easy<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.710> assign<00:00:26.070> custom

Xtreme mapping which controller you're
going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.750> adding<00:00:40.350> custom<00:00:40.650> MIDI<00:00:41.250> maps<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
going to be adding custom MIDI maps to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to be adding custom MIDI maps to
you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.380> top<00:00:43.560> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you can just go up here to the top and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
you can just go up here to the top and
click<00:00:43.980> controller<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:45.330> give<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> name

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
click controller I will give it a name

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780 
click controller I will give it a name
so<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.410> I'll<00:00:46.560> call<00:00:46.740> it<00:00:46.890> X<00:00:47.100> session<00:00:47.580> and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
so for this I'll call it X session and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.370 
so for this I'll call it X session and
you<00:00:47.880> can<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.330> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.690> choices<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
you can see that we have choices for the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.260 
you can see that we have choices for the
input<00:00:49.740> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> output<00:00:50.010> we're<00:00:50.880> just<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
input and the output we're just going to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.160 
input and the output we're just going to
set<00:00:51.480> X<00:00:51.690> session<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.880> we'll<00:00:53.880> click<00:00:54.060> set<00:00:54.300> now

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
set X session and we'll click set now

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.230 
set X session and we'll click set now
we've<00:00:55.470> told<00:00:55.800> extreme<00:00:56.310> mapping<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.090> we're

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
we've told extreme mapping that we're

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.600 
we've told extreme mapping that we're
going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> X<00:00:57.960> session<00:00:58.350> Pro<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.860> that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
going to use the X session Pro and that

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.520 
going to use the X session Pro and that
we're<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.880> to<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.090> part<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.630> for<00:01:01.080> both<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
we're going to use part one for both the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
we're going to use part one for both the
input<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.130> output<00:01:02.160> okay<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:02.880> now<00:01:03.000> we're

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
input and the output okay so now we're

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
input and the output okay so now we're
going<00:01:03.240> to<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.450> through<00:01:03.720> one<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> wizard

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
going to go through one of the wizard

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.039 
going to go through one of the wizard
options<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.060> allow<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.359> to<00:01:06.509> easily

options this will allow you to easily

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
options this will allow you to easily
map<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.189> group<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.060> controls<00:01:09.539> to<00:01:09.719> your<00:01:09.929> MIDI

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
map a group of controls to your MIDI

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.679 
map a group of controls to your MIDI
controller<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.579> really<00:01:12.000> fast<00:01:12.240> really

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
controller and it's really fast really

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
controller and it's really fast really
simple<00:01:13.170> let's<00:01:13.590> check<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.789> gonna

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
simple let's check it out I'm gonna

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
simple let's check it out I'm gonna
click<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.329> wizard<00:01:15.750> button<00:01:15.929> here<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.499> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
click the wizard button here up at the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.789 
click the wizard button here up at the
top<00:01:17.329> then<00:01:18.329> we're<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.899> a<00:01:19.170> mixer

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
top then we're going to go to a mixer

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.789 
top then we're going to go to a mixer
and<00:01:20.039> we'll<00:01:20.579> choose<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.270> channels<00:01:21.799> just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and we'll choose two channels just

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
and we'll choose two channels just
because<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.249> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.429> easy<00:01:23.579> you<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
because it's going to be easy you can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
because it's going to be easy you can
see<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.929> everything<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.710> slides<00:01:26.009> away

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
see that everything kind of slides away

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.260 
see that everything kind of slides away
and<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.179> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:28.649> wizard<00:01:29.609> that<00:01:29.969> will<00:01:30.119> go

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and now we have the wizard that will go

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.029 
and now we have the wizard that will go
through<00:01:30.569> all<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.319> different<00:01:31.649> mappings

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
through all of the different mappings

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.880 
through all of the different mappings
that<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:32.789> for<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.569> two<00:01:33.960> channel<00:01:34.229> mixer

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that it has for a two channel mixer

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.410 
that it has for a two channel mixer
the<00:01:35.039> first<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.240> tell

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the first thing is it's going to tell

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.599 
the first thing is it's going to tell
you<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.960> controlled<00:01:37.649> you're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.249> to<00:01:38.460> be

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
you what controlled you're going to be

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.090 
you what controlled you're going to be
setting<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.780> mini<00:01:39.929> controller<00:01:40.319> in<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
setting to your mini controller in this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
setting to your mini controller in this
