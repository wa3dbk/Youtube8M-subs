it's understandable that within each

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's understandable that within each
family<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> sign<00:01:22.680> language<00:01:23.009> for

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
family this is the sign language for

family this is the sign language for
console<00:01:23.820> family<00:01:24.180> um<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.950> maybe

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
console family um that you would maybe

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
console family um that you would maybe
be<00:01:26.790> able<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.720> they're<00:01:28.020> both

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
be able to do that because they're both

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
be able to do that because they're both
xbox<00:01:28.560> live<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.250> they're<00:01:29.340> both<00:01:29.520> a
