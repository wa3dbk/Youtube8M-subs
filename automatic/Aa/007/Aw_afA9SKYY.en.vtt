drive I said it it goes off at the right
time<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> works<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.750> tap<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
time and the way it works is you tap the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880 
time and the way it works is you tap the
screen<00:00:34.800> once<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.969> snooze<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> tap<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
screen once to snooze it when I tap the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.670 
screen once to snooze it when I tap the
screen<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.540> shuts<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> alarm<00:00:39.989> off<00:00:40.110> completely

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
screen it shuts the alarm off completely

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100 
screen it shuts the alarm off completely
so<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.210> nine-thirty<00:00:42.660> cuz
