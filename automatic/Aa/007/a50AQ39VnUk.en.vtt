00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.590
 a person accompanying the blur scrutinized 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.590
 We present to you the edition 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.059
 american beatrice capra years 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.059
 real south latest director movie zack snyder 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.009
 director of films like 300 and in colatina 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.439
 in this North American edition stands out 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.609
 Why does she come? 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.300
 in two speeches 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.619
 whenever on the disk you will find the version of itself 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.690
 on another disk if it will find the edition that indicates that it even has 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.560
 I have to be here. 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.640
 it's because 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 this is a differential 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 because in brazil the warner decided plansab only the movie version 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.000
 Brazilian decision of the film has only 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.030
 a risk 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 Besides that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200
 How can you now? 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.220
 to perceive 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.100
 the American edition there comes with a glove 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 I do not rent any crazy in the bush 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.370

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.980
 very tasteful 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 with metallic effects you can see here in the facha 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.550
 I believe that any 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.440
 Herself 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.910

 intimate portrait with the effects more but moments 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.280
 the case comes close 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.329
 with the title 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.780
 This is worrying about the clergy. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 just as the square does that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.300

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.220

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.410

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 effect on the background 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.340
 but the very beautiful material very good 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
