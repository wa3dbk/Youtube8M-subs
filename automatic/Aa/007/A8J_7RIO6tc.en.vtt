 the white snake 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.750
 by the grimm brothers 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.590
 a long time ago lived a king in 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.950
 wisdom and is famous throughout the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.260
 country 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.000
 nothing remained unknown to him and he 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.030
 seemed like the news of things the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.219
 more secrets you were carried by the air 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.899
 he had a strange custom every day 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.280
 after dinner when the table were 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.920

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.989
 no one a trusted servant him 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.809
 to present a dish covered including himself 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.670
 ignore the content and no one else 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.649
 did not know either because the king did not 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.440
 discovered the dish that when 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.000
 was all alone this ride had already 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.949
 lasted a few times when once 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.170
 as the servant remove the dish from 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.510
 king the curious idea the pig has so much 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.540
 that he could not resist and carried off in 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.380
 his room he carefully closed the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.899
 door 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.830
 leval lid and saw that in the dish 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.820
 there was a white snake at this aspect 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.289
 he was taken a mad desire to taste it 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 he cut into a small piece and put it 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.479
 in his mouth barely the piece 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.569
 touched his tongue he heard a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.220
 little guezoui in front of his window he has there 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.750
 to listen and recognized that is silent 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.280
 sparrows who told each other what they 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.789
 had seen in the fields and in the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.670
 meadows 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.240
 the snake had given him the faculty of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.740
 understand the language of animals 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 it happened that the same day the most beautiful 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.579
 ring of the vanished queen and that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.250
 suspected the servant who were going 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.799
 everywhere to have stolen the king did it 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.630
 come and told him that if before 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.469
 next day he had not named the thief 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.509
 he would be considered as such and hanged 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.110
 he vainly protesting his innocence he 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.060
 was fired without getting anything else 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.270
 in his anguish he went down into the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.030
 court and there he began to dream by means of 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.829
 get out of such a great danger 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.109
 ducks were laying at the water's edge 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:15.590
 he was moving to smear themselves with their 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:18.739
 beak and was holding an intimate conversation the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.630
 servant stopped and listened to one and he 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.630
 tells and where he had gone this morning and 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.390
 what a good food he had found 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.489
 so one of them will predict arm me I 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.170
 stomach ache for swallowing a 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.810
 ring that was on the window of the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.060
 Queen servant immediately grabs him by 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.859
 the neck and his son carry to the kitchen 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.620
 where he says to the cook at my house so this 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.480
 duck so to reer for ten cooks in 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.599
 taking it in his hand a long time ago 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.970
 he's waiting for them will make a good roast and he 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.460
 cut off his head 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.570
 when we empty him the tray of the queen is 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.610
 found in his stomach 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.560
 the servant could now prove 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.330
 easily his innocence and the king who 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 had to repair a wrong against him 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.200
 authorized to ask for a grace in him 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.240
 promising the first place at his court 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.250
 but he refuses everything and our demands have 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.840
 that a horse and money to travel 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.660
 because he wanted to see the world 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.430
 for some time he began to 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.380
 high and one day arrived at the edge of a 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.320
 pond where he noticed three fish that 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.210
 had caught himself in the reeds as he 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.010
 understood the language of animals they 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.420
 heard them complain about what they 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.810
 were going to die miserably 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.810
 he pitied them down said horse and 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.520
 handed the three prisoners back to the water 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.330
 these wiggles air of joy and say 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.580
 to their savior 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.430
 we will remember and tend us 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.620
 will reward one day he continued his 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.570
 way and sometime after he's him 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.170
 seemed to hear a voice his feet in 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.770
 sand 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.320
 he listened but it was the king of the ants 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.970
 who were complaining to 6 men 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 only wanted to stay away from us 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.470
 with their massive animals this clumsy 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.630
 of horse kill me without mercy but jeans 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.459
 with his irons then the servant stands 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.560
 turned a little to the left and the king 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.500
 ants cried I'll remember 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.700
 and I will reward you one day 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.769
 however the path that had taken 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 our traveler took him to a forest 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.090
 where he saw crows throwing their 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.860
 child out of the nest will do in famine 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.300
 he's eating all you're 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.680
 we can not feed you anymore 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.440
 now it's big enough for you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.359
 feed yourself the poor beasts 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.549
 were on cold land fluttering and 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.680
 fluttering wings he cries out yesterday to 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.720
 unfortunate that we are we have to 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.850
 seek our own food and we 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.820
 can not fly yet we are left 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.040
 to die of hunger the good traveler 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.229
 then dismounted killed him 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.700
 with his sword and left him like 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.340
 food to young ravens he 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.380
 hopping around and saying we 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.290
 do not forget your well done and we 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.180
 tend to reward one day it was necessary 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.250
 now continue the journey on foot and 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.870
 after our long market 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.090
 husband goes to a rich city 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.640
 there was a big noise and a big 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.740
 Crowd by the streets and a horse hero 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.780
 informed the people that the daughter of the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.160
 looking king is a spouse that whoever 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 would like the request and had to accomplish 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.330
 a work 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.550
 difficult but that if they fail and they 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.680
 would lose their lives many had 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.870
 already tried had in vain play their 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.430
 existence but the young man seeing 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.130
 the beauty of the princess 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.040
 forget at all hazards to greet the king 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.510
 and it's not like pretenders have the 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.370
 led to the water's edge and we throw 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.350
 under his eyes in the waves a ring 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.570
 that he was ordered to search deep inside 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.730
 the bim threatening him if he went back without 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.190
 hold her to rush him back into 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.800
 the waters touched regretted the handsome young 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.190
 man he was left alone on the shore of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.300
 the sea 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.700
 he remained there the resolute friend thinking about this 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.070
 he would do it suddenly 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.750
 collected 3 acura fish swimming and who 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.880
 were none other than those to whom he 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.650
 had saved the life hardly has that of the 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.419
 middle had in his mouth a shell that he 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.240
 me on the shore at the foot of the young man 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.000
 and when he prayed to him, he opened it 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.250
 there found the backdoor filled with joy 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.260
 he went off to the king expecting to 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.870
 receive from him the reward win 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.370
 but the proud princess learning that he 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.169
 was not of the same nobility as she 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.810
 the refusal said he had to accomplish 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.780
 a second task she went down to 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.390
 garden and threw herself 10 bags of 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.520
 tickets he will have to have it picked up before 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.680
 that the sun of tomorrow is lifted and 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.419
 without missing a single young grain 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.490
 man examines a coming in how 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.860
 they could obey this requirement 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.660
 he sits sad cloud in the garden 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.400
 believer well agrees to take 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.080
 to put him to death the next morning 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.060
 when the first rays of the sun 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.310
 fell on the poor man's garden 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.560
 pretenders city and ten bags filled with 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.380
 thousands without a single grain iman case 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.140
 in the night the king of the ants were 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.580
 came with thousands of his subjects and 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.350
 the grateful animals had 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.950
 gathered all the millet fills all 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.229
 the bags 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.000
 the king's daughter 20 herself in this place 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.229
 is quickly amazed that the young 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.300
 man had accomplished what she had 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.370
 requested but she could not yet 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.169
 defeat his haughty mood and 10 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.390
 although he fulfilled both conditions 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.039
 he will not be my husband before 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.780
 to have an apple from the tree of life 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.880
 never the young man find us 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.890
 the tree of life if young raven who 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.930
 it owed their existence does not it 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.450
 helped he had grown up during all this 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.020
 time and had followed their savior and 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.270
 when they heard that there 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.310
 asked princess he was flying to the 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.990
 search for the tree of life and one two 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.729
 years brings back an apple in its beak 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.419
 then dropped it into the hand of 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.580
 traveler 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.080
 so this one presents it to the beautiful 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.430
 princess and as the last 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.240
 conditions were met 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.740
 he had no more excuses left 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.169
 so she became the young man's wife 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.520
 and when the old king died his 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:32.740
 son- in- law is at the crown 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.810
 and as both spouses had eaten 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.750
 the apple of the tree of life they lived 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.710
 happy until a very advanced age 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.710
 There you go
