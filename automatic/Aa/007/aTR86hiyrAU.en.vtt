00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.940 
you'll notice she hadn't missed yet I'm
not<00:03:38.460> quite<00:03:39.390> as<00:03:39.510> good<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.900> think<00:03:39.960> then<00:03:40.770> one

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
not quite as good as I think then one

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
not quite as good as I think then one
more<00:03:41.160> time<00:03:43.070> all<00:03:44.070> right<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.430> obvious<00:03:44.790> that

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
more time all right so it's obvious that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.120 
more time all right so it's obvious that
I'm<00:03:45.090> not<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.630> fast<00:03:46.110> pitch<00:03:46.350> softball<00:03:46.380> hitter<00:03:47.010> I'm

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
I'm not a fast pitch softball hitter I'm

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.680 
I'm not a fast pitch softball hitter I'm
a<00:03:47.190> baseball<00:03:47.370> player<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:47.940> put<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.210> into<00:03:48.420> terms

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
a baseball player so put it into terms

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.650 
a baseball player so put it into terms
that<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.290> understand<00:03:49.710> what<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> 50<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:51.180> 55

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that I can understand what is a 50 to 55

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.290 
that I can understand what is a 50 to 55
mile-per-hour<00:03:52.160> fastball<00:03:53.160> from<00:03:53.430> 40<00:03:53.880> feet<00:03:53.910> how

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
mile-per-hour fastball from 40 feet how

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.120 
mile-per-hour fastball from 40 feet how
does<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.600> translate<00:03:54.959> into<00:03:55.260> baseball<00:03:55.709> math

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
does that translate into baseball math

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.590 
does that translate into baseball math
of<00:03:56.310> 60<00:03:56.580> feet<00:03:56.760> six<00:03:56.970> inches<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.360> would<00:03:57.480> be

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
of 60 feet six inches it would be

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.150 
of 60 feet six inches it would be
probably<00:03:57.959> about<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.320> same<00:03:58.500> thing<00:03:58.770> as<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> high

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
probably about the same thing as a high

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.220 
probably about the same thing as a high
school<00:03:59.430> baseball<00:03:59.610> player<00:04:00.120> throwing<00:04:00.570> about<00:04:00.780> 85

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
school baseball player throwing about 85

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.810 
school baseball player throwing about 85
90<00:04:01.260> miles<00:04:01.800> an<00:04:01.920> hour<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.280> what's<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.489> ninety<00:04:02.670> mile

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
90 miles an hour so what's a ninety mile

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.370 
90 miles an hour so what's a ninety mile
per<00:04:02.970> hour<00:04:03.030> faster<00:04:03.480> yeah<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
per hour faster yeah and then at the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.630 
per hour faster yeah and then at the
College<00:04:04.680> World<00:04:04.739> Series<00:04:04.890> level<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.520> the
