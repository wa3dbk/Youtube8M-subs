00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.600

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.170
 and I'm going to cut them into little cubes without 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.170
 peel no more washed 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'm going to cut them into cubes and I'm going to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 put to boil with the liter of water and the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 salt my chayotes already have 10 minutes 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.310
 serving in the liter of water and salt 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.570
 I'm going to turn them off and I'm going to drain them 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.570
 I'm going to remove the water 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.940
 if not 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.420
 in the same pot where I almost fell silent 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.370
 I'm going to heat it up with a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 teaspoon olive oil 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 I'm going to put my eye here in the pot and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.310
 at the same time the crushed onion 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 I'm going to put the cream 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 It is low in fat 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.299
 a quarter of cream we put the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 ground pepper just milk and you 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.770
 we move that it looks a little 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.770
 to be able to throw the consommÃ© 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 When it starts to boil it is already alone and 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.040
 is the ideal moment is bubbling my 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.590
 casserole that we're going to put the cheese 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.160
 Parmesan if they do not have parmesan cheese 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.980
 you can put manchego or a cheese that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.890
 the same amount melts when you 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.050
 start to integrate the cheese we put 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.050
 the consommÃ© we move 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.480
 and the time to put our chayotes 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.970
 We integrate them very well 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.100
 we let them two minutes to boil and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.100
 they are ready to eat
