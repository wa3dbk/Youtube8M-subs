when someone suffers a cardiac arrest

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.830 
when someone suffers a cardiac arrest
they<00:00:47.710> usually<00:00:47.920> collapse<00:00:48.520> immediately<00:00:49.210> they

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
they usually collapse immediately they

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.740 
they usually collapse immediately they
use<00:00:50.080> consciousness<00:00:50.860> rapidly<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:52.450> they<00:00:52.690> are

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.770 

there<00:01:02.400> is<00:01:02.490> a<00:01:02.520> difference<00:01:03.000> between<00:01:03.180> sudden

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there is a difference between sudden

cardiac arrest and a heart attack and
this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.300> often<00:01:06.540> confused<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.890> Communists
