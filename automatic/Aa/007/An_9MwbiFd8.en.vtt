00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.590
 people is 91 Fabian buy 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.849
 I hope you are right in 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.680
 awards for a new video on the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.580
 chain a new review there in sight 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.860
 of a player I was lucky 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.079
 to get in the arica packs a 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.050
 tiff version so the third version 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.940
 boost of tottenham English scorer who 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.710
 is available at the 28th team of the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.420
 week until next wednesday 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 you have his first stats that are in 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.149
 scroll down I invite you to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.040
 put on pause put forward the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.059
 observe at the team level I'm 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.950
 am not taken the lead 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.600
 I did a first class barclays 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.539
 everything is simpler but at 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.519
 final it was really effective on the 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.289
 live so the price range of the kent 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.519
 we will start like this now we 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.649
 is obliged to talk about this famous 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.440
 price range a fork 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.730
 between 75 miles and 150,000 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 credit on both consoles 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.500
 I think it's a bit high 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.300
 for now it's good but for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
 cheaper you have better in first league 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.150
 I'm thinking of sturridge van 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.800
 persie 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.990
 so after that it's true that it's a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.810
 player boost that there is some hype 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.149
 around the player but I think that 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.770
 not worth it to ask so much about him 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.689
 although it's true that I found 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.979
 pretty good so we'll talk now 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.420
 of these negative points because he has 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.730
 some so already at the level of the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.110
 speed 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.610
 I found that Harry Caine was 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.990
 rather heavy then there are matches where 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.490
 no problem 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.410
 other matches where he was really 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.640
 heavy yet there are 77 on the 4g with 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.620
 players much longer than that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 in the game and I have not had this problem 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.630
 there but oddly so the harry 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.560
 Caine there are matches where he low 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.680
 was picking up the defenders 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.570
 others where he galerait and series x that's 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.130
 still not bad problem after 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.320
 he compensates for this small lack of speed 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.360
 and still compensated by the fact 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.540
 that they make monstrous calls but 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.700
 that I will come back after in relation to the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.210
 positive point after another point 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.730
 negative 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.520
 technically it at 1.85 1.95 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.420
 anything 1.76 in dribbling game it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.160
 has three bad foot stars 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 technically the naughty technically 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 he is naughty so it's true that you 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220
 go see in the review I still 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 put some rake and hook 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.490
 interesting but it's that in 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.190
 execution dribbling I too x 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.540
 was rather average and suddenly I 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.910
 decided to clarify it 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.100
 and finally the three bad foot stars 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.330
 a left foot means still a foot 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.200
 left means actually it's points 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.050
 negatives these means his means he has 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 a rather average left foot even 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.730
 bad and in some situations 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.590
 it's quite complicated then the points 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.150
 kane positives because after there are 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 still has a lot of positives 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.570
 so already level of finish 83 in 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.190
 finish it remains a really very stat 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.330
 interesting to remember that at the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.050
 base the kent it's still a 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.520
 player 4.68 of general he had 68 3 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.260
 by the way in finishing so the guy has 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.170
 still took a monstrous between 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.930
 all these different versions and bah 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.340
 there he finds himself with a very fine finish 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.440
 interesting in front of the cages he is very 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.700
 very good after at the level of his physique 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.780
 so I have it all encompassing because 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.150
 physically she has very stats 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.090
 interesting so 76 in strength 80 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.070
 equilibrium 80 years or 1.74 in agility that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 can not really have any problem so 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.520
 this stats in jumps combinations 1 m 88 and 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.730
 his stats in head game he's really 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.810
 very very dangerous in the aerial game 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.950
 1.82 in head precision so I 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.020
 also put in the positive points of the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.239
 blow the head game physically I 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.940
 back on it 76 in force 80 in 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.260
 balance they fall very very rare 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.730
 my and that's still very 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.840
 interesting for a scorer sight who is 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.460
 often had to play the shoulder against 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.220
 defenders who have stats 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.710
 high in terms of physics 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.050
 after at the level of the loupiotes 85 years 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.700
 so shot 89 in hitting power 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.080
 it's madness the loupiotes with 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.360
 we or not elsewhere can be seen that 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.060
 this last clip in monstrous wrapped 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.430
 do not hesitate to swoon down the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.110
 rolled up because it takes 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.210
 improbable curves and besides I 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.400
 put in the positive po I put the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.080
 effects in Harry Caine so there you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.700
 have the balance sheet of harry caine who 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.280
 appears before your eyes so at the level 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.590
 positive points as I said and 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.790
 done at the basic effect level in 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.980
 the balloon you could see on the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.650
 last strikes that the moment is taking 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.600
 pretty violent groups the finish 83 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.810
 finish is very very good in front of 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.160
 cages his physical low whatever it is 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.580
 balance of strength 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.090
 agility is really big 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.920
 shot 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.300
 he sends distant strikes in 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.070
 all the senses and it's very interesting 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.919
 the ball checks very good 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.350
 ball catch that allows him precisely 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.940
 down to project themselves quite easily towards 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.130
 the front a very good head game 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.270
 combined with his low stats so in jump and 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.410
 his meter 88 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.630
 he is very dangerous in the aerial game 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.250
 the better it is at the level of 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.590
 the head always positioning well 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.390
 placed and he always makes the right call 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.980
 in the depth so if you have any 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.140
 good smugglers behind him there will be 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.430
 no problem on that side the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.810
 punching power in points 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.270
 positive and finally in the points 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.430
 negative the speed I found clumsy 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.890
 a little bit about certain situations 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.180
 edrip technically his ways and the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.440
 three stars bad foot one foot 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.940
 left rather blah 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.050
 you see the stats with on the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.480
 last seen that and I forgot to 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.669
 put the stats by matches 14 goals with 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.320
 so a very very good record for a 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.450
 player that I still find enough 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.770
 dear and in premier league ago when 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.050
 even so here is stéphane pattier 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.640
 otherwise hd for review 2 harry 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.200
 Caine Chief I hope this review 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.150
 you liked this review carpet does not hesitate 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.530
 not to put 1 inch blue to buy a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.720
 comment to share this video was 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.290
 told your family to everyone 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.910
