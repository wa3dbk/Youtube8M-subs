00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
got three layers leather the top layer

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
got three layers leather the top layer
which<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> everything<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.879> layer

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
which is on top of everything that layer

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.840 
which is on top of everything that layer
glows<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> reason<00:00:41.309> I've<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
glows that's the reason I've got that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.049 
glows that's the reason I've got that
that's<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> tower<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.370> tie<00:00:44.370> outline

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that's the tower that's the tie outline

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
that's the tower that's the tie outline
but<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> slight<00:00:46.230> glow<00:00:46.620> effect<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> is

but with a slight glow effect on it is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.889 
but with a slight glow effect on it is
you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.850> probably<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.270> around<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> edges

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you can probably see around the edges

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.310 
you can probably see around the edges
there<00:00:50.329> that's<00:00:51.329> also<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.870> makes<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.199> look

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
there that's also what makes you look

in then I do ctrl C which is to copy it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
in then I do ctrl C which is to copy it
and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> background<00:01:46.680> layer<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.100> do

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and then in the background layer I do

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.380 
and then in the background layer I do
ctrl<00:01:47.970> V<00:01:48.540> now<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.729> white<00:01:51.000> on

ctrl V now as you can see the white on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.530 
ctrl V now as you can see the white on
the<00:01:51.450> middle<00:01:51.899> layer<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:53.240> covered<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.329> what's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the middle layer has covered up what's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
the middle layer has covered up what's
in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> background<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> stop<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
in the background so that's to stop it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
in the background so that's to stop it
from<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> edges<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.790> shrink

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
from going over the edges I then shrink

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.840 
from going over the edges I then shrink
it<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> size<00:02:02.640> we've

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it down I think that's the size we've

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.770 
it down I think that's the size we've
got<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.180> finished<00:02:03.570> product<00:02:03.930> i'm<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.259> sure

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
got it on finished product i'm not sure

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.029 
got it on finished product i'm not sure
something<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.560> position

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
something like that and then I position

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.639 
something like that and then I position
that<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> want<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.810> add<00:02:10.229> layer

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that where I want it then I do add layer

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.070 
that where I want it then I do add layer
and<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.280> keep<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.849> below<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.420> center<00:02:12.810> later

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and I keep it below the center later

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.860 
and I keep it below the center later
now<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.980> wants<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.610> behind<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.420> that's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
now this wants to be behind that that's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.610 
now this wants to be behind that that's
on<00:02:16.110> top<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.700> take<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.620> which

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
on top and I will then take this which

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.450 
on top and I will then take this which
is<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.250> GU<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.020> slime<00:02:22.530> or<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> toxic

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
is the GU or the slime or the toxic

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.420 
is the GU or the slime or the toxic
waste<00:02:23.670> or<00:02:23.850> whatever<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.240> want<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> call<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
waste or whatever you want to call it I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.710 
waste or whatever you want to call it I
select<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.730> bottom<00:02:27.120> layer<00:02:27.300> which<00:02:27.420> I've<00:02:27.570> just

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
select the bottom layer which I've just

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.830 
select the bottom layer which I've just
created<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.260> again<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.490> ctrl<00:02:30.150> V<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
created and again I do ctrl V and I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.630 
created and again I do ctrl V and I
position<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> where<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> want<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> position

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
position that where I want to position

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.960 
position that where I want to position
it<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.210> case<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.750> would<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.080> there<00:02:34.880> then<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
it in this case it would be there then I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.580 
it in this case it would be there then I
take<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.240> background<00:02:37.250> again<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.490> select

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
take the background again I select

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.770 
take the background again I select
control<00:02:40.590> C<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:43.130> below<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.580> add<00:02:44.820> another

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
control C and below that I add another

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.570 
control C and below that I add another
layer<00:02:46.080> which<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.530> put<00:02:46.770> hello<00:02:47.160> both<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
layer which I put hello both these and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.600 
layer which I put hello both these and
there<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.310> drag<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.340> into

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
there we go I just drag that into

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
there we go I just drag that into
position<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:56.120> press<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.300> D<00:02:57.480> select<00:02:57.840> button

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
position and press the D select button

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.650 
position and press the D select button
as<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.830> each<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.190> them<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.850> you're

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
as you do with each of them now you're

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.220 
as you do with each of them now you're
probably<00:03:00.870> wondering<00:03:02.030> again<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.420> why<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> have

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
probably wondering again now why I have

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.500 
probably wondering again now why I have
this<00:03:04.410> white<00:03:04.800> layer<00:03:05.100> well<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
this white layer well what I do is I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.120 
this white layer well what I do is I
merge<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.200> down<00:03:07.590> into<00:03:08.090> everything<00:03:09.090> else<00:03:10.130> so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
merge that down into everything else so

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.800 
merge that down into everything else so
once<00:03:11.340> I've<00:03:11.520> done<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.700> that's<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:12.540> one

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
once I've done that that's all now one

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.370 
once I've done that that's all now one
layer<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.860> i<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.190> select<00:03:14.400> round<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.510> press

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
layer so i can select round that press

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.009 
layer so i can select round that press
the<00:03:16.590> Delete<00:03:16.920> key<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.430> there<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.420> go<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
the Delete key and there you go all that

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.630 
the Delete key and there you go all that
background<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.650> gone<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.010> that's<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.430> that

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
background is gone and that's just that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.490 
background is gone and that's just that
in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> tie<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.810> course<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.350> also

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
in the tie and of course you can also

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.600 
in the tie and of course you can also
undo<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.430> by<00:03:23.670> using<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.300> undo<00:03:24.870> button<00:03:25.610> but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
undo that by using the undo button but

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.699 
undo that by using the undo button but
I'm<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:26.910> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.300> I'm<00:03:28.230> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.470> leave<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
I'm not going to I'm going to leave it

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.520 
I'm not going to I'm going to leave it
as<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.040> was<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.570> reason<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.230> two

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
as it was now the reason I have two

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.259 
as it was now the reason I have two
layers<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.130> as<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.760> mentioned<00:03:32.790> at<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
layers is as I mentioned at the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
layers is as I mentioned at the
beginning<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.660> layers<00:03:34.019> glowing<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:34.650> you

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
beginning that layers glowing if you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.910 
beginning that layers glowing if you
select<00:03:35.400> around<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.390> glow<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.019> delete<00:03:37.709> it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
select around the glow and delete it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.530 
select around the glow and delete it
removes<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.670> glow<00:03:38.880> off<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.239> edge<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
removes the glow off the edge of the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.600 
removes the glow off the edge of the
time<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.110> looks<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.530> jagged<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.220> horrible

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
time it looks really jagged and horrible

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.470 
time it looks really jagged and horrible
so<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> don't<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.640> have<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:45.000> separate

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
so I don't do that I have a separate

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.330 
so I don't do that I have a separate
layer<00:03:45.630> underneath<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.260> doesn't<00:03:46.680> glow<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.310> I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
layer underneath which doesn't glow so I

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.930 
layer underneath which doesn't glow so I
can<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.690> easily<00:03:48.900> than<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.380> merge<00:03:49.940> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
can just do that easily than I merge the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.460 
can just do that easily than I merge the
glow<00:03:51.150> layer<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.540> top<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.080> there<00:03:52.350> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
glow layer on top of it and there you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.009 
glow layer on top of it and there you
have<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.890> finished<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.360> course<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.930> do

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
have a finished I then of course I do

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.699 
have a finished I then of course I do
file<00:03:55.500> save<00:03:56.150> as<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.050> important<00:03:58.560> if

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
file save as and this is important if

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.740 
file save as and this is important if
you<00:03:58.830> want<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.250> be<00:03:59.280> transparent<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.570> need

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
you want it to be transparent you need

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.060
