together and then using a sieve add the
icing<00:04:10.530> sugar<00:04:11.540> slowly<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.560> little<00:04:13.590> bit

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
icing sugar slowly so just a little bit

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.860 
icing sugar slowly so just a little bit
at<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.220> time<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.850> then<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.780> mix<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.199> together

at a time and then just mix it together

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.420 
at a time and then just mix it together
if<00:04:17.870> at<00:04:18.080> this<00:04:18.230> point<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.860> think<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
if at this point you think that the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.910 
if at this point you think that the
frosting<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.090> little<00:04:20.420> bit<00:04:20.570> too<00:04:20.780> runny<00:04:21.080> which

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
frosting is a little bit too runny which

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.820 
frosting is a little bit too runny which
mine<00:04:22.220> obviously<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:23.000> then<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.140> thicken<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.620> you

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
mine obviously is then to thicken it you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.400 
mine obviously is then to thicken it you
can<00:04:24.980> just<00:04:25.010> add<00:04:25.400> some<00:04:25.460> more<00:04:25.850> icing<00:04:26.450> sugar<00:04:26.660> it's

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
can just add some more icing sugar it's

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.040 
can just add some more icing sugar it's
reached<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.130> right<00:04:28.340> consistency<00:04:28.900> when<00:04:29.900> you

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
reached the right consistency when you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.900 
reached the right consistency when you
can<00:04:30.260> do<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.920> doesn't<00:04:31.310> fall<00:04:31.520> off<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
can do that it doesn't fall off the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
can do that it doesn't fall off the
spoon<00:04:33.340> place<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.670> lower<00:04:34.970> level<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.570> cake
