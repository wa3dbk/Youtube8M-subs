on<00:00:39.010> he's<00:00:39.850> an<00:00:39.970> absolute<00:00:40.090> beast<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.720> a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
on he's an absolute beast of a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.690 
on he's an absolute beast of a
goalkeeper<00:00:41.380> he's<00:00:41.680> only<00:00:41.829> regen<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.430> think<00:00:42.610> he's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
goalkeeper he's only regen I think he's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.060 
goalkeeper he's only regen I think he's
only<00:00:42.850> around<00:00:43.030> 16<00:00:43.480> 17<00:00:43.990> and<00:00:44.230> he<00:00:44.710> was<00:00:44.800> only<00:00:44.950> eight

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
only around 16 17 and he was only eight

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.400 
only around 16 17 and he was only eight
million<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:46.210> crowd<00:00:46.420> loved<00:00:46.630> him<00:00:46.750> already<00:00:47.020> but

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
million the crowd loved him already but

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.380 
million the crowd loved him already but
he'll<00:00:47.560> only<00:00:47.650> be<00:00:47.920> an<00:00:48.100> understudy<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.820> Tim<00:00:49.090> cruel

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
he'll only be an understudy to Tim cruel

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.569 
he'll only be an understudy to Tim cruel
so<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.290> think<00:00:50.500> I'd<00:00:50.560> ever<00:00:50.680> say<00:00:50.920> them<00:00:51.130> things<00:00:51.340> in

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
so I think I'd ever say them things in

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.580 
so I think I'd ever say them things in
real<00:00:51.730> life<00:00:51.940> but<00:00:51.970> Tim<00:00:52.810> cruel<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.230> probably<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
real life but Tim cruel is probably the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.580 
real life but Tim cruel is probably the
best<00:00:53.710> keeper<00:00:54.100> in<00:00:54.280> my<00:00:55.120> PES<00:00:55.390> world<00:00:55.660> apart<00:00:56.050> from<00:00:56.260> I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and I think that if there's a team that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.720 
and I think that if there's a team that
gets<00:02:16.720> over<00:02:17.080> 40<00:02:17.440> points<00:02:17.800> by<00:02:18.100> January<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
gets over 40 points by January and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.400 
gets over 40 points by January and
you're<00:02:18.880> not<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.270> them<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:20.320> you're

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you're not one of them I think you're

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
you're not one of them I think you're
going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.650> struggle<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.280> last<00:02:21.640> season

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
going to struggle because last season

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
more so than i did last year because i

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.910 
more so than i did last year because i
