00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.480
 well now I'm going to make some tortillas 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.300
 from drier here I already have four cups 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.970
 of more dry 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.530
 I'm going to put him 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 Half cup of flour 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.630
 half a cup of flour 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.440
 and now I'm going to stir it, it's not 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.440
 puts salt and butter or nothing 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.219
 t so you stir whole belly 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.219
 return 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.380
 until it is very watery or very 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.810
 It is hard but not too watery 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.290
 You can make the tortillas if it stays very 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.290
 hard either 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.310
 look for this amount of more 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.799
 dry I put 4 cups of water 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.409
 with that is enough with that 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.020
 well that can be done there are not even 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.479
 watery 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.810
 and the dough lasts because it stays like that, not what 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.810
 they can do 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.780
 and so they revolt her for about 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.319
 three or five minutes I create five 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.399
 minutes so that it is well well kneaded 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.399
 so that the tortillas are turned 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.069
 look here I have the most advanced 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.280
 Now let's make the balls 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.719
 more or less like that or the tortilla depends on 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.120
 size that remains in some orca the 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.099
 what was 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.720
 and the waters that do not come out very 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.720
 Thin tortillas very thick 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.700
 and the flour is put so that they can 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.569
 make the tortillas because you see that the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.569
 drier comes very 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.780
 very very depressed they can be done about 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.780
 beings are very ugly 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.090
 and they taste better with flour 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.760
 but I'm going to show you how 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.739
 make 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.269
 Well look, I have my list ready 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.629
 tortillera that is a tortillera 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.629
 wood 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.260
 here I have my their I have them do sul es 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.549
 round cut 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.549
 and now let's start 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.790
 it gets in the middle 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 you press a little bit not much since it's 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.430
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.430
 if we remove the first plastic 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.210
 and later 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.810
 we passed it in the left hand 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.680
 we remove this plastic 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.680
 and now we go 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.319
 now I wash it will pass in this hand so 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.319
 now we are going towards the wrong arch 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.959
 and then it was an era 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.960
 I will do the following 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.019
 we like it very thick they can tighten it 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.019
 a little more 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.990
 look for knowledge as the pose that 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.070
 how is it that you look at what you 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.220
 that the color dies a little bit what 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.390
 white looks like a little yellow already 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.390
 is ready to flip it 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.070
 they have gone with my finger 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.069
 see how it is also ready to 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.069
 evolution 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.440
 a little left so you can watch a 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.090
 little bit more known to be able 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.390
 flip it over because it's not turned around and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.390
 volpe 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.820
 look when you look at them 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.320
 this color 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.320
 and you can turn around 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.680
 and that's how the tortillas are 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.020
 they are checking that it costs well 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.000
 as it is already if we want it more 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.000
 with a little more color is already 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.520
 as you can see it looks good in cooked 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.770
 this is how they are 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.770
 already cooked 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.390
 well that's all for being there today 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.390
 liked
