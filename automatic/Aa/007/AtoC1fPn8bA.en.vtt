00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi, Alex Beach, today we are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.750
 touch on the subject of a black box under 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.200
 name apple tivi which by the way neither 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 never been updated for two whole years 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.980
 last run 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.940
 upgraded version already 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.660
 existing third generation 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.510
 consoles 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.270
 then they modified the chip in it again 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.430
 made it more energy efficient during 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.070
 all these updates starting from 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.289
 This second generation console singular 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.599
 changes we did not feel a little bit 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.410
 tightened and and hardware capabilities and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.530
 that's all 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.079
 but how does the functional seem to me that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 this moment it is already morally obsolete and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.590
 now I write tell me what to do to take 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
 3 Poltava 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.010
 or wait for the fourth let's try 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 deal with it is a big chance 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.949
 the fact that very soon it will take place 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.140
 The release of the next generation of consoles from 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 apple and according to the latest rumors 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 will most likely happen next 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.159
 month 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 June 8 at the exhibition ww Dissit 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.240
 it became known that the company is already as soon as possible 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.240
 wants to say goodbye to the current version they 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.180
 even a price tag of up to 69 dollars specifically 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.580
 lowered to sell off all remaining 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.070
 batches of this product fortunately not 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.830
 only we understand that today's 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 console functions began to be missed and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.490
 very long ago 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.340
 ample time is enjoyed by apple tivi 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.119
 will understand that it is painfully boring current 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.910
 functional 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.100
 lacking the usual client in youtube 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.800
 airplay technology by which we 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.950
 transfer images from a device ios 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.670
 on telly or listening to music sometimes you can 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.520
 listen to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.520
 itunes radio is all on this list 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.979
 interesting chips ends still possible 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.399
 buy or rent a movie enter he 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.390
 old and that it is still possible to do this 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.310
 surprised recently seen on the internet news 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.009
 from one of the company's employees 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.380
 transmitted data regarding the remote control 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.220
 for consoles that have not undergone 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.390
 changes show that even since 2009 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.489
 fourth generation 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.690
 Cupertins want to equip it 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.690
 touch pad 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.120
 no look at him he's comfortable handsome 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.690
 but still there is a feeling like 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.240
 like something else is missing guy 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.730
 added that besides the touchpad is a new apple 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.460
 repair will have two mechanical 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.370
 buttons most likely those keys 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.470
 call menu and start playback and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.860
 know that touch control 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.200
 will replace the big 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.150
 four-way keys have also been 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.520
 It is noted that subsequently such 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.160
 gadget changes will be a little thicker 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.260
 predecessor here is all the information 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.190
 which managed to get a newspaper in 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
 New York Times 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.620
 on the new console for the console a lot 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.540
 information was about a separate store 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.209
 apps for apple tivi 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.670
 if this is the way tatami games should be 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.280
 it means the corresponding 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 controls maybe it can 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.740
 perform this most updated remote 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.870
 dou 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.209
 maybe apple wants to make the top 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.640
 xbox and playstation 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.170
 because in this apple can get very 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.060
 significant benefits 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.160
 because developers are much 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.190
 more efficient to develop an application 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.510
 just for the appstore 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.790
 if in new apple tivi will 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.450
 ability to install other applications 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.700
 then you have to implement at least 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.830
 64-bit a7 chip which uses 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.320
 iphone 5s is of course for this 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.620
 need more RAM 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.540
 it can be there one gigabyte 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.980
 In addition, more capacious plans are planned. 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.010
 flash-card 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.989
 there plans to introduce siri and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.360
 the arrival of the Russian localization she 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.239
 really will be a useful thing there 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.000
 for example you say siri find in you 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.340
 video about the most awesome cars she 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.950
 opens youtube with a list of videos about 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.700
 awesome cars who use sitting on 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.959
 ios 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 and there are many of them he will understand what I mean 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.889
 also next apple heavy company 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.290
 intends to open access to the new by 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.620
 such a television apple with the broadcast 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.520
 about 25 popular channels including 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.350
 Fox and BBC without and others now 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.699
 who has a prefix that can 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.870
 subscribe to the channel 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.130
 icebear for 15 dollars a month 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.710
 presumably the webstore will be open 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.199
 special download section 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.199
 channels will be a selection of sports topics 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.690
 news children's programs and users 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.050
 by their personal preference will be 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.570
 choose so i called all the most 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.430
 likely waiting for changes in the next 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.560
 the generation of consoles from apple 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.139
 I would like to know which of you 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.820
 enjoys and from and which of the functions are you on 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.349
 and use the most 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.599
 like and join a group 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.760
 vkontakte subscribe to my twitter

 reviews it was oleg sketch while mine 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.860
 expensive
