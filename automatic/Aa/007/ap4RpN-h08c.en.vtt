00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
know that's really good even if you are

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.490 
know that's really good even if you are
not<00:04:11.970> particularly<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.269> fan<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.690> beets<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.319> mean<00:04:14.470> I

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
not particularly a fan of beets I mean I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680 
not particularly a fan of beets I mean I
know<00:04:14.620> Martin<00:04:14.949> and<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.250> do<00:04:15.310> enjoy<00:04:15.669> them<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:16.570> if

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
know Martin and I do enjoy them but if

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.460 
know Martin and I do enjoy them but if
you're<00:04:16.810> not<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.320> fan<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.159> that<00:04:19.199> specific<00:04:20.199> beet

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
you're not a fan of that specific beet

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.390 
you're not a fan of that specific beet
type<00:04:20.859> flavor

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
type flavor

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.080 
type flavor
this<00:04:22.300> isn't<00:04:22.659> overly<00:04:23.050> beady<00:04:23.680> you've<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.610> makes

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
this isn't overly beady you've not makes

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.640 
this isn't overly beady you've not makes
any<00:04:25.270> sense<00:04:25.510> because<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.020> all<00:04:26.349> of<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.620> other

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
any sense because of all of the other

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.140 
any sense because of all of the other
ingredients<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.400> then<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.699> think<00:04:28.030> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
ingredients and then I think the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.320 
ingredients and then I think the
sweetness<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.780> grapes<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.530> carrots

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
sweetness of the grapes and the carrots

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.480 
sweetness of the grapes and the carrots
definitely<00:04:31.330> balances<00:04:31.870> out<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.490> bitterness

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
definitely balances out the bitterness

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.330 
definitely balances out the bitterness
of<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.940> beets<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:34.659> the<00:04:34.750> beet<00:04:34.900> greens<00:04:35.280> as<00:04:36.280> well

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
of the beets and the beet greens as well

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.640 
of the beets and the beet greens as well
as<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.240> ginger<00:04:37.659> gives<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.260> nice<00:04:38.500> little

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
as the the ginger gives it a nice little

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.379 
as the the ginger gives it a nice little
bit<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.860> sharpness<00:04:39.130> as<00:04:39.400> well<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:39.849> it's<00:04:40.030> overall

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
bit of sharpness as well so it's overall

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.779 
bit of sharpness as well so it's overall
it's<00:04:40.750> it's<00:04:41.110> really<00:04:41.349> quite<00:04:42.039> pleasant<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.580> think

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
it's it's really quite pleasant I think

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:43.290 
it's it's really quite pleasant I think
you'll<00:04:42.909> enjoy<00:04:43.150> it

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
you'll enjoy it
