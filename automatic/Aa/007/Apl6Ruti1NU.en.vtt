too<00:03:03.820> sure<00:03:04.060> but<00:03:04.690> here<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> stopped<00:03:05.320> at<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> pretty

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
too sure but here I stopped at a pretty

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.680 
too sure but here I stopped at a pretty
good<00:03:06.070> spot<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.549> get<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> closer<00:03:07.299> look<00:03:07.420> at<00:03:07.630> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
good spot you get a closer look at the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.390 
good spot you get a closer look at the
aliens<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.200> some<00:03:08.350> little<00:03:08.620> spike<00:03:09.040> right<00:03:09.250> here

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
aliens of some little spike right here

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.650 
aliens of some little spike right here
just<00:03:09.640> really<00:03:09.910> we're<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:10.239> they<00:03:10.329> have<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
just really we're and then they have I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.860 
just really we're and then they have I
think<00:03:10.750> assault<00:03:11.440> an<00:03:11.650> alien<00:03:12.070> sir<00:03:12.280> rifle<00:03:12.870> looks

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
think assault an alien sir rifle looks

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.509 
think assault an alien sir rifle looks
the<00:03:13.959> same<00:03:14.140> as<00:03:14.320> yours<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.799> mean<00:03:14.950> look<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.310> has<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
the same as yours I mean look it has the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.020 
the same as yours I mean look it has the
same<00:03:15.730> yellow<00:03:15.910> thing<00:03:16.209> here<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.510> there<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
same yellow thing here and there so I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.300 
same yellow thing here and there so I
don't<00:03:19.030> know

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.619 

so<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.610> we<00:03:23.790> had<00:03:23.879> a<00:03:23.909> good<00:03:24.060> glimpse<00:03:24.329> of

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
so here we go we had a good glimpse of

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.800 
so here we go we had a good glimpse of
the<00:03:25.159> red<00:03:26.159> dot<00:03:26.400> now<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:27.269> not<00:03:27.299> too<00:03:27.540> sure<00:03:27.689> with

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the red dot now I'm not too sure with

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.599 
the red dot now I'm not too sure with
this<00:03:28.140> part<00:03:28.439> is<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.189> pops

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
this part is what I think that that pops

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.949 
this part is what I think that that pops
up<00:03:29.790> every<00:03:29.939> time<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.299> shoot<00:03:30.599> someone<00:03:30.810> more

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
up every time you shoot someone more

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.720 
up every time you shoot someone more
that<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.680> by<00:03:32.010> itself<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.370> didn't<00:03:32.579> see

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
that just there by itself I didn't see

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.399 
that just there by itself I didn't see
but<00:03:33.180> again<00:03:33.420> here<00:03:33.689> are<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:34.170> are<00:03:34.290> all<00:03:34.379> things

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
but again here are these are all things

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.800 
but again here are these are all things
i<00:03:34.680> guess<00:03:34.799> with<00:03:34.950> jetpacks<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:36.269> them<00:03:36.420> which<00:03:36.689> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
i guess with jetpacks for them which is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.390 
i guess with jetpacks for them which is
kind<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.019> weird<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.859> pretty<00:03:38.069> cool<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.310> get

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
kind of weird but so pretty cool we get

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.580 
kind of weird but so pretty cool we get
flying<00:03:38.670> enemies<00:03:38.879> now<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.900> right

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
flying enemies now with this and right

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.869 
flying enemies now with this and right
here<00:03:40.620> if<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.099> don't<00:03:41.250> see<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.670> San

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
here if you don't see it's a San

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.309 
here if you don't see it's a San
