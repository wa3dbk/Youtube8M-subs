depends on the trellising system but

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.930 
depends on the trellising system but
what<00:00:47.230> can<00:00:47.440> happen<00:00:47.679> is<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.370> posts<00:00:48.789> can

what can happen is the posts can
actually<00:00:49.269> be<00:00:49.359> pulled<00:00:49.660> toward<00:00:50.050> each<00:00:50.199> other<00:00:50.379> as

the weight of the fruit and the plants
is<00:00:53.199> on<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:54.039> now<00:00:54.550> there's<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.879> lot<00:00:55.059> of

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
is on that now there's a lot of

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.779 
is on that now there's a lot of
different<00:00:55.539> type<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:56.160> anchoring<00:00:57.160> systems<00:00:57.609> that

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
different type of anchoring systems that

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.040 
different type of anchoring systems that
can<00:00:57.940> be<00:00:57.969> used<00:00:58.239> just<00:00:58.359> like<00:00:58.539> there's<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> lot<00:00:58.960> of

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
can be used just like there's a lot of

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.479 
can be used just like there's a lot of
different<00:00:59.289> types<00:00:59.469> of<00:00:59.620> trellising<00:01:00.100> systems

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
different types of trellising systems

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.189 
different types of trellising systems
but<00:01:00.850> one<00:01:01.089> that's<00:01:01.269> worked<00:01:01.480> well<00:01:01.600> for<00:01:01.719> me<00:01:01.960> and

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
but one that's worked well for me and

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.229 
but one that's worked well for me and
it's<00:01:02.410> actually<00:01:02.920> pretty<00:01:03.070> easy<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.399> install<00:01:03.789> is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
it's actually pretty easy to install is

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.300 
it's actually pretty easy to install is
what<00:01:04.960> i<00:01:04.989> have<00:01:05.230> right<00:01:05.410> here<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:06.070> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
what i have right here this is the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.230 
what i have right here this is the
anchor<00:01:06.700> itself<00:01:07.150> if<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.650> was<00:01:08.860> just<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.370> piece<00:01:10.030> of

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
anchor itself if it was just a piece of

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.760 
anchor itself if it was just a piece of
tubing<00:01:10.510> or<00:01:10.870> metal<00:01:11.230> that<00:01:11.380> went<00:01:11.530> into<00:01:11.650> the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
tubing or metal that went into the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.050 
tubing or metal that went into the
ground<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.070> wouldn't<00:01:12.280> be<00:01:12.370> much<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.550> an<00:01:12.760> anchor

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
ground it wouldn't be much of an anchor

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.490 
ground it wouldn't be much of an anchor
so<00:01:13.210> there's<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.450> feature<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.350> makes

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
so there's a feature to this that makes

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.130 
so there's a feature to this that makes
it<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.740> good<00:01:15.310> good<00:01:15.820> anchor<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.990> what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
it a good good anchor and that is what

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.530 
it a good good anchor and that is what
you<00:01:17.260> see<00:01:17.440> right<00:01:17.620> there<00:01:17.800> at<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.980> tip<00:01:18.210> once<00:01:19.210> this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
you see right there at the tip once this

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.900 
you see right there at the tip once this
is<00:01:19.750> driven<00:01:19.990> into<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.500> ground<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.610> there's<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
is driven into the ground then there's a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.140 
is driven into the ground then there's a
pin<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.750> slides<00:01:23.260> down<00:01:23.470> inside<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.310> this<00:01:24.700> once

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
pin that slides down inside of this once

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.060 
pin that slides down inside of this once
it's<00:01:25.330> at<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.600> ground<00:01:25.840> level<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.770> pin

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
it's at the ground level and the pin

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's at the ground level and the pin
then<00:01:27.310> drives<00:01:27.670> out<00:01:27.910> these<00:01:28.120> metal<00:01:28.480> tines<00:01:28.750> that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
then drives out these metal tines that

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.340 
then drives out these metal tines that
come<00:01:29.200> up<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.590> spiral<00:01:29.920> come<00:01:30.310> out<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.640> spiral

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
come up in a spiral come out in a spiral

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.890 
come up in a spiral come out in a spiral
kind<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.470> curlicue<00:01:32.920> mode<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.720> is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
kind of a curlicue mode and that is

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.990 
kind of a curlicue mode and that is
actually<00:01:35.260> what<00:01:35.380> creates<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.640> anchor

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
actually what creates the the anchor

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.850 
actually what creates the the anchor
itself<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.840> let<00:01:37.960> me<00:01:38.050> show<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.230> how<00:01:38.410> these<00:01:38.590> go

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
itself so let me show you how these go

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.550 
itself so let me show you how these go
in<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.280> how<00:01:39.970> easy<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.630> do<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:41.320> can<00:01:41.470> do

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
in and how easy it is to do you can do

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560 
in and how easy it is to do you can do
these<00:01:41.740> all<00:01:42.190> by<00:01:42.400> yourself<00:01:42.790> if<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.150> works<00:01:43.390> out

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
these all by yourself if it works out

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.090 
these all by yourself if it works out
that<00:01:43.600> way<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.500> first<00:01:44.710> thing<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:44.920> I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
that way so the first thing that I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.580 
that way so the first thing that I
usually<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.760> do<00:01:45.910> is<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.440> make<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
usually like to do is just to make a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
usually like to do is just to make a
spacing<00:01:48.160> easy<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:49.090> they<00:01:49.180> just<00:01:49.360> cut<00:01:49.540> this

spacing easy and they just cut this

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.110 
spacing easy and they just cut this
about<00:01:49.990> 3<00:01:50.290> feet<00:01:50.530> long<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:51.400> way<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.670> know<00:01:51.820> where

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
about 3 feet long that way I know where

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.150 
about 3 feet long that way I know where
to<00:01:52.150> put<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.630> anchor<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.470> relation<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.040> the

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
to put the anchor in relation to the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.260 
to put the anchor in relation to the
post<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.260> this<00:01:56.260> little<00:01:56.560> plate<00:01:56.980> helps<00:01:57.820> hold

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
post and this little plate helps hold

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.180 
post and this little plate helps hold
that<00:01:58.510> as<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:58.810> drive<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.170> into<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.410> ground<00:01:59.590> so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
that as I drive it into the ground so

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.470 
that as I drive it into the ground so
actually<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.820> first<00:02:00.850> thing<00:02:01.210> we'll<00:02:01.330> do<00:02:01.450> is

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
actually the first thing we'll do is

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.750 
actually the first thing we'll do is
we'll<00:02:01.720> put<00:02:01.900> this<00:02:02.020> clip<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.550> will

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
we'll put this clip on it and that will

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.660 
we'll put this clip on it and that will
be<00:02:04.330> what<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.660> attached<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.260> wire<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.920> this

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
be what we attached the wire to this

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.699 
be what we attached the wire to this
then<00:02:07.030> slides<00:02:07.450> down<00:02:07.630> inside<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.560> little

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
then slides down inside of the little

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.859 
then slides down inside of the little
plate<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.340> will<00:02:09.759> create<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.119> barrier<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.660> it

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
plate that will create a barrier so it

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.140 
plate that will create a barrier so it
don't<00:02:11.319> just<00:02:11.470> lose<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.250> ground<00:02:12.280> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
don't just lose it down in the ground so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.390 
don't just lose it down in the ground so
there's<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.230> distance<00:02:14.530> out<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.800> need<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.220> be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
there's the distance out I need to be

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.750 
there's the distance out I need to be
move<00:02:15.970> my<00:02:16.120> PVC<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.020> way<00:02:17.490> we'll<00:02:18.490> put

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
move my PVC out of the way we'll put

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.899 
move my PVC out of the way we'll put
that<00:02:18.970> down<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.470> start<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.010> this

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
that down in to start it like this

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.349 
that down in to start it like this
and<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.900> sledgehammer<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.730> what<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:24.849> use<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
and a sledgehammer is what we use to

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.319 
and a sledgehammer is what we use to
begin<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.019> drive<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.379> down<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.999> these<00:02:27.999> go<00:02:28.209> in

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
begin to drive it down in these go in

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.699 
begin to drive it down in these go in
pretty<00:02:28.540> easy<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.109> ground<00:02:29.319> here<00:02:29.590> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
pretty easy the ground here is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.110 
pretty easy the ground here is
reasonably<00:02:30.219> hard<00:02:30.579> though

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
reasonably hard though

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.520 
reasonably hard though
so<00:02:32.969> just<00:02:33.969> pound<00:02:34.180> them<00:02:34.359> down<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.840> let<00:02:35.139> me<00:02:35.170> stand

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
so just pound them down in let me stand

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.300 
so just pound them down in let me stand
back<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.739> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:38.590> these<00:02:38.769> down<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.280> a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
back a little bit get these down in a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.140 
back a little bit get these down in a
little<00:02:39.609> bit<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:39.939> goes<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.139> pretty<00:02:41.319> easy<00:02:41.650> now

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.839 

once<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.659> inside<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.819> plate<00:02:48.819> there

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
once it's down inside that plate there

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.839 
once it's down inside that plate there
the<00:02:49.450> next<00:02:49.659> thing<00:02:49.810> we'll<00:02:50.079> do<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.530> use<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.489> pin

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
the next thing we'll do is use this pin

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.059 
the next thing we'll do is use this pin
and<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.930> now<00:02:53.139> it's<00:02:53.349> down<00:02:53.469> at<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.709> level<00:02:53.919> that

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
and so now it's down at the level that

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.520 
and so now it's down at the level that
it<00:02:54.250> would<00:02:54.370> be<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:55.480> pin<00:02:55.840> will<00:02:56.200> slip<00:02:56.500> down

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
it would be the pin will slip down

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.709 
it would be the pin will slip down
inside<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.219> it<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.669> that'll<00:02:58.030> go<00:02:58.150> up<00:02:58.299> against

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
inside of it and that'll go up against

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.129 
inside of it and that'll go up against
the<00:02:59.680> metal<00:03:00.010> tines<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.609> are<00:03:00.730> down<00:03:00.879> inside<00:03:01.359> so

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
the metal tines that are down inside so

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.589 
the metal tines that are down inside so
I'll<00:03:02.319> begin<00:03:02.469> to<00:03:02.680> pound<00:03:02.919> that<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.969> once<00:03:04.449> I

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
I'll begin to pound that in and once I

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.399 
I'll begin to pound that in and once I
get<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.959> down<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.469> ways<00:03:06.719> then<00:03:07.719> these<00:03:08.019> as<00:03:08.260> I'm

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
get that down a ways then these as I'm

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.399 
get that down a ways then these as I'm
hammering<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.389> those<00:03:10.389> tines<00:03:10.780> are<00:03:11.019> starting<00:03:11.349> to

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
hammering it those tines are starting to

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.089 
hammering it those tines are starting to
come<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:15.989> okay<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.260> we've<00:03:17.409> got<00:03:17.439> that<00:03:17.769> driven

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
come out okay so we've got that driven

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.199 
come out okay so we've got that driven
all<00:03:18.219> the<00:03:18.310> way<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:18.760> means<00:03:18.879> all<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
all the way in so that means all the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.000 
all the way in so that means all the
little<00:03:19.389> times<00:03:19.659> have<00:03:19.810> been<00:03:19.930> pushed<00:03:20.199> out<00:03:20.379> so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
little times have been pushed out so

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.819 
little times have been pushed out so
we'll<00:03:21.219> take<00:03:21.340> our<00:03:21.489> pin<00:03:21.699> out<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:23.049> take<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
we'll take our pin out and then take the

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.059 
we'll take our pin out and then take the
plate<00:03:24.040> out<00:03:24.219> of<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.340> way<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:26.349> anchor<00:03:26.680> will

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
plate out of the way and the anchor will

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.569 
plate out of the way and the anchor will
be<00:03:27.159> in<00:03:27.250> place<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.720> now<00:03:29.409> that's<00:03:29.680> nice<00:03:30.310> and

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
be in place so now that's nice and

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.729 
be in place so now that's nice and
secure<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.689> next<00:03:31.959> thing<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.109> we'll<00:03:32.319> do<00:03:32.500> is

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
secure the next thing that we'll do is

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.249 
secure the next thing that we'll do is
create<00:03:33.489> an<00:03:33.579> basically<00:03:34.150> an<00:03:34.239> eyelet<00:03:34.599> system<00:03:35.079> to

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:35.259 
create an basically an eyelet system to

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.999 
create an basically an eyelet system to
run<00:03:35.439> the<00:03:35.560> run<00:03:35.949> the<00:03:36.040> wire<00:03:36.280> through<00:03:36.699> so<00:03:38.009> take

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009 
run the run the wire through so take

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:45.289 
run the run the wire through so take
some<00:03:39.220> staples<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:43.389> we'll<00:03:44.019> put<00:03:44.199> three<00:03:44.409> staples

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
some staples and we'll put three staples

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.879 
some staples and we'll put three staples
here<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.419> a<00:03:46.509> way<00:03:46.659> that<00:03:46.870> we<00:03:46.959> can<00:03:47.109> allow<00:03:47.259> the<00:03:47.319> wire

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
here in a way that we can allow the wire

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.740 
here in a way that we can allow the wire
to<00:03:48.069> feed<00:03:48.250> through<00:03:48.459> just<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> make<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.509> easy<00:03:49.629> I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
to feed through just to make it easy I

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.939 
to feed through just to make it easy I
used<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:49.989> make<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.139> little<00:03:50.290> mark<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.650> my<00:03:50.709> hammer

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
used to make a little mark on my hammer

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.770 
used to make a little mark on my hammer
so<00:03:51.189> I<00:03:51.250> know<00:03:51.340> where<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.579> put<00:03:51.819> those<00:03:51.970> makes<00:03:52.599> it

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
so I know where to put those makes it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.929 
so I know where to put those makes it
real<00:03:52.930> easy<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.259> do<00:03:53.439> that<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.919> we'll<00:03:54.489> step<00:03:54.759> one

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
real easy to do that and we'll step one

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:04.860 
real easy to do that and we'll step one
there<00:03:58.919> and<00:04:01.979> put<00:04:02.979> one<00:04:03.099> on<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.340> side<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:04.629> one

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
there and put one on this side the one

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.499 
there and put one on this side the one
on<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.199> sides<00:04:05.620> i<00:04:05.889> usually<00:04:06.219> put<00:04:06.400> just<00:04:06.669> usually

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:07.509 
on the sides i usually put just usually

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.390 
on the sides i usually put just usually
put<00:04:07.689> those<00:04:07.780> just<00:04:08.049> slightly<00:04:08.469> lower<00:04:08.769> because

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
put those just slightly lower because

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.949 
put those just slightly lower because
the<00:04:09.669> wires<00:04:10.000> going<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.299> be<00:04:10.389> feeding<00:04:10.659> down

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the wires going to be feeding down

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.319 
the wires going to be feeding down
anyway<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.769> actually<00:04:12.489> these<00:04:12.669> we'll<00:04:12.939> use<00:04:13.090> for

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
anyway and actually these we'll use for

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.449 
anyway and actually these we'll use for
the<00:04:13.389> wire<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.840> goes<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.379> vertical<00:04:15.340> line

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
the wire that goes to the vertical line

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.819 
the wire that goes to the vertical line
post<00:04:15.759> -<00:04:16.000> as<00:04:16.900> far<00:04:17.109> as<00:04:17.259> those<00:04:19.440> catch<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> one<00:04:20.739> on

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
post - as far as those catch the one on

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.300 
post - as far as those catch the one on
the<00:04:20.889> other<00:04:20.979> side<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.940> we'll<00:04:22.389> have<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:23.310> there's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the other side and we'll have it there's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.899 
the other side and we'll have it there's
our<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.550> one<00:04:24.699> now<00:04:26.490> something<00:04:27.490> else<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.759> I

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
our that one now something else that I

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.640 
our that one now something else that I
do<00:04:27.969> that<00:04:28.419> makes<00:04:28.659> a<00:04:29.080> little<00:04:29.199> bit<00:04:29.289> easier<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
do that makes a little bit easier to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.439 
do that makes a little bit easier to
pull<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:29.919> wire<00:04:30.219> through<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:30.969> once<00:04:31.240> those

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
pull the wire through is this once those

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.870 
pull the wire through is this once those
are<00:04:31.479> already<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.050> place<00:04:32.409> like<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:33.159> use

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
are already in place like that I use

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.760 
are already in place like that I use
these<00:04:34.150> as<00:04:34.389> little<00:04:34.539> spacers

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
these as little spacers

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.249 
these as little spacers
so<00:04:36.639> instead<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.330> wire<00:04:37.479> just<00:04:37.720> dragging<00:04:38.110> up

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
so instead of the wire just dragging up

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.580 
so instead of the wire just dragging up
against<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.970> wood<00:04:40.240> I'll<00:04:40.840> use<00:04:41.199> them<00:04:41.349> just

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
against the the wood I'll use them just

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.640 
against the the wood I'll use them just
like<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.449> to<00:04:43.449> make<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:43.990> easier<00:04:44.349> to<00:04:44.380> pull<00:04:44.560> it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
like that to make it easier to pull it

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.040 
like that to make it easier to pull it
through<00:04:44.860> now<00:04:45.550> it's<00:04:45.819> ready<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> have<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.900> wire

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
through now it's ready to have the wire

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.279 
through now it's ready to have the wire
be<00:04:47.259> fed<00:04:47.470> through<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.940> wire<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.210> cut<00:04:49.630> about<00:04:49.720> for

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
be fed through the wire I cut about for

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.409 
be fed through the wire I cut about for
these<00:04:50.410> about<00:04:50.680> ten<00:04:50.949> feet<00:04:51.250> in<00:04:51.490> length<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.300> way

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
these about ten feet in length that way

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.700 
these about ten feet in length that way
I<00:04:52.449> know<00:04:52.569> I've<00:04:52.750> got<00:04:52.930> plenty<00:04:53.139> of<00:04:53.319> it<00:04:53.440> I'll<00:04:53.560> just

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
I know I've got plenty of it I'll just

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.890 
I know I've got plenty of it I'll just
feed<00:04:53.949> this<00:04:54.130> through<00:04:54.490> through<00:04:55.360> these<00:04:55.569> and<00:04:55.810> then

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
feed this through through these and then

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.330 
feed this through through these and then
of<00:04:55.990> course<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.349> feeds<00:04:56.590> through<00:04:56.830> really<00:04:57.069> easy

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
of course it feeds through really easy

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.980 
of course it feeds through really easy
with<00:04:57.580> those<00:04:57.699> staples<00:04:58.270> already<00:04:58.660> being<00:04:58.840> in

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
with those staples already being in

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.670 
with those staples already being in
place<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.919> they'll<00:05:00.160> right<00:05:00.639> up<00:05:00.819> against<00:05:01.090> those

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
place and they'll right up against those

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.040 
place and they'll right up against those
I'll<00:05:02.680> pull<00:05:02.949> this<00:05:03.099> down<00:05:03.370> till<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:03.819> get<00:05:03.940> about<00:05:04.150> all

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
I'll pull this down till I get about all

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.770 
I'll pull this down till I get about all
about<00:05:05.349> even<00:05:05.620> with<00:05:05.740> my<00:05:05.979> miny<00:05:06.789> here<00:05:07.389> about<00:05:07.569> that

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
about even with my miny here about that

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.740 
about even with my miny here about that
far<00:05:08.050> now<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.680> wire<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:09.789> end<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.330> I'm

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
far now the wire this end of it I'm

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.980 
far now the wire this end of it I'm
actually<00:05:10.930> going<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.470> hook<00:05:12.159> through<00:05:12.610> my<00:05:13.389> my

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
actually going to hook through my my

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.320 
actually going to hook through my my
clip<00:05:14.380> here<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.800> as<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.669> can<00:05:15.789> see<00:05:15.849> down<00:05:16.120> this

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
clip here and as you can see down this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.180 
clip here and as you can see down this
way<00:05:16.479> I've<00:05:16.659> got<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.870> piece<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.229> PVC<00:05:17.409> that<00:05:17.770> works

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
way I've got a piece of PVC that works

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.760 
way I've got a piece of PVC that works
as<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> as<00:05:18.759> a<00:05:19.000> barrier<00:05:19.539> or<00:05:19.810> as<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.199> little<00:05:20.470> a

as a as a barrier or as a little a
little<00:05:21.190> sleeve<00:05:21.460> over<00:05:21.639> that<00:05:21.849> so<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.150> protects

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
little sleeve over that so that protects

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.749 
little sleeve over that so that protects
it<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:22.840> from<00:05:23.500> anybody<00:05:23.770> running<00:05:23.979> into<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.370> so

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
it and from anybody running into it so

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.700 
it and from anybody running into it so
that's<00:05:24.880> about<00:05:25.060> where<00:05:25.419> it's<00:05:25.539> going<00:05:25.569> to<00:05:25.780> go<00:05:25.960> fold

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
that's about where it's going to go fold

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.279 
that's about where it's going to go fold
the<00:05:26.860> wire<00:05:27.039> just<00:05:27.310> like<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.699> grab<00:05:28.449> my<00:05:28.690> piece<00:05:29.110> of

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
the wire just like that grab my piece of

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.760 
the wire just like that grab my piece of
PVC<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:30.069> feed<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.699> right<00:05:31.509> on<00:05:31.659> through<00:05:31.960> bend

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
PVC and feed that right on through bend

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.680 
PVC and feed that right on through bend
it<00:05:32.919> out<00:05:33.009> at<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.340> bottom<00:05:33.520> enough<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.360> can<00:05:34.569> get

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
it out at the bottom enough so I can get

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.730 
it out at the bottom enough so I can get
the<00:05:34.840> clip<00:05:35.800> over<00:05:36.009> it<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.870> then<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:38.199> order<00:05:38.560> to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
the clip over it and then in order to

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.070 
the clip over it and then in order to
secure<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.400> I<00:05:39.610> can<00:05:40.150> use<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.360> little<00:05:40.630> device

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
secure it I can use a little device

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.959 
secure it I can use a little device
that's<00:05:41.380> called<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.710> ripple<00:05:42.340> just<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.759> little

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
that's called a ripple just a little

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.700 
that's called a ripple just a little
gripper<00:05:43.300> it's<00:05:43.419> kind<00:05:43.570> of<00:05:43.599> a<00:05:43.690> one-way<00:05:43.900> wire<00:05:44.320> feed

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
gripper it's kind of a one-way wire feed

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.640 
gripper it's kind of a one-way wire feed
and<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:46.000> will<00:05:46.180> slide<00:05:46.479> in<00:05:46.690> like<00:05:47.289> you<00:05:47.440> see

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
and that will slide in like you see

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.730 
and that will slide in like you see
right<00:05:47.680> there<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.990> won't<00:05:50.139> you<00:05:50.289> can't<00:05:50.530> pull<00:05:50.710> it

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
right there it won't you can't pull it

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.159 
right there it won't you can't pull it
back<00:05:50.949> out<00:05:51.159> once<00:05:51.759> it's<00:05:51.969> in<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.690> we'll<00:05:52.810> feed<00:05:53.020> that

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
back out once it's in so we'll feed that

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.709 
back out once it's in so we'll feed that
down<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.759> then<00:05:54.759> we'll<00:05:54.909> take<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.120> other<00:05:55.389> side

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
down and then we'll take the other side

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.980 
down and then we'll take the other side
and<00:05:56.099> feed<00:05:57.099> it<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.340> there<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.759> that's<00:05:58.750> what

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
and feed it in there and that's what

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.520 
and feed it in there and that's what
creates<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:01.150> tightness<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:01.960> we<00:06:02.380> can

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
creates the tightness to it we can

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.370 
creates the tightness to it we can
tighten<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.039> up<00:06:03.159> just<00:06:03.400> like<00:06:04.060> that

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.390 

tighten<00:06:08.380> these<00:06:08.500> there's<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.830> little<00:06:09.069> tool<00:06:09.219> we

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
tighten these there's a little tool we

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.700 
tighten these there's a little tool we
can<00:06:09.490> use<00:06:09.550> get<00:06:09.789> them<00:06:09.940> even<00:06:10.030> tighter<00:06:10.300> now<00:06:10.840> one

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
can use get them even tighter now one

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.170 
can use get them even tighter now one
last<00:06:11.919> thing<00:06:12.039> I'll<00:06:12.280> do<00:06:12.460> before<00:06:12.819> I<00:06:12.849> tighten<00:06:13.060> that

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
last thing I'll do before I tighten that

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.860 
last thing I'll do before I tighten that
completely<00:06:13.659> is<00:06:13.810> I'll<00:06:14.169> take<00:06:14.349> my<00:06:14.500> sleeve<00:06:14.889> and

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
completely is I'll take my sleeve and

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.200 
completely is I'll take my sleeve and
it's<00:06:16.870> 3/4<00:06:17.380> inch<00:06:17.500> so<00:06:17.620> it<00:06:17.710> fits<00:06:17.949> nice<00:06:18.819> and<00:06:18.849> tight

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
it's 3/4 inch so it fits nice and tight

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.659 
it's 3/4 inch so it fits nice and tight
around<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:19.719> and<00:06:20.139> I'll<00:06:20.229> just<00:06:20.430> tap<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:21.610> down

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
around that and I'll just tap that down

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:28.469 
around that and I'll just tap that down
in<00:06:23.639> and<00:06:25.169> there<00:06:26.169> it's<00:06:26.289> in<00:06:26.409> place<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:27.210> to<00:06:28.210> finish

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
in and there it's in place and to finish

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.640 
in and there it's in place and to finish
up<00:06:28.599> we'll<00:06:28.780> just<00:06:28.960> trim<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.139> little<00:06:29.259> bit<00:06:29.380> of<00:06:29.530> wire

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
up we'll just trim a little bit of wire

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.309 
up we'll just trim a little bit of wire
off<00:06:31.319> like<00:06:32.319> that<00:06:32.909> and<00:06:34.050> there<00:06:35.050> we<00:06:35.139> have<00:06:35.289> our

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
off like that and there we have our

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.020 
off like that and there we have our
impulse<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.430> other<00:06:36.550> nice<00:06:36.729> thing<00:06:37.000> about

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
impulse and the other nice thing about

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.050 
impulse and the other nice thing about
this<00:06:37.599> is<00:06:37.870> because<00:06:38.199> I'm<00:06:39.099> going<00:06:39.370> to<00:06:39.430> put<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.639> plant

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
this is because I'm going to put a plant

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.059 
this is because I'm going to put a plant
right<00:06:40.360> here<00:06:40.750> the<00:06:41.110> plant<00:06:41.440> will<00:06:41.620> be<00:06:41.860> able<00:06:41.979> to

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
right here the plant will be able to

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.950 
right here the plant will be able to
grow<00:06:42.219> up<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.460> wire<00:06:42.699> and<00:06:42.969> these<00:06:43.300> plants<00:06:43.750> on<00:06:43.870> the

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
grow up the wire and these plants on the

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.750 
grow up the wire and these plants on the
ends<00:06:44.199> often<00:06:44.560> wind<00:06:45.159> up<00:06:45.279> being<00:06:45.460> a<00:06:45.550> little<00:06:45.639> bit

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
ends often wind up being a little bit

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.670 
ends often wind up being a little bit
stronger<00:06:46.240> just<00:06:46.570> because<00:06:46.750> they've<00:06:46.930> got<00:06:47.139> a<00:06:47.169> lot

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
stronger just because they've got a lot

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.580 
stronger just because they've got a lot
of<00:06:47.710> growing<00:06:48.010> area

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
of growing area

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.409 
of growing area
so<00:06:49.160> that'll<00:06:49.460> finish<00:06:49.580> episode<00:06:50.120> number<00:06:50.270> three

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
so that'll finish episode number three

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.970 
so that'll finish episode number three
and<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.110> next<00:06:51.380> thing<00:06:51.530> that<00:06:51.560> we'll<00:06:51.770> do<00:06:51.860> is

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
and the next thing that we'll do is

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.500 
and the next thing that we'll do is
start<00:06:52.100> to<00:06:52.280> put<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.490> irrigation<00:06:52.850> system<00:06:53.210> in

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
start to put the irrigation system in

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.210 
start to put the irrigation system in
I'll<00:06:53.870> run<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.169> trench<00:06:54.530> all<00:06:54.710> the<00:06:54.740> way<00:06:54.800> across<00:06:55.100> and

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
I'll run a trench all the way across and

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.060 
I'll run a trench all the way across and
you'll<00:06:56.030> see<00:06:56.270> how<00:06:56.389> we<00:06:56.419> run<00:06:56.690> the<00:06:56.750> risers<00:06:57.350> up<00:06:57.650> just

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
you'll see how we run the risers up just

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.320 
you'll see how we run the risers up just
like<00:06:58.190> this<00:06:58.430> to<00:06:58.669> tie<00:06:58.850> into<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.210> irrigation

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
like this to tie into the irrigation

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.540 
like this to tie into the irrigation
system<00:06:59.840> it'll<00:07:00.200> that'll<00:07:00.800> be<00:07:00.919> there<00:07:01.130> for<00:07:01.490> the

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
system it'll that'll be there for the

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.430 
system it'll that'll be there for the
plants<00:07:01.850> so<00:07:02.480> thanks<00:07:02.750> very<00:07:02.810> much<00:07:02.990> for<00:07:03.110> joining

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
plants so thanks very much for joining

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.230 
plants so thanks very much for joining
