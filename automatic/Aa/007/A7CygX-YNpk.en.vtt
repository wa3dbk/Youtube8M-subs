00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
 chapter 10 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.170
 brothers 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.700
 certainly the longing of my heart and my prayer to God for israel is for 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.849
 salvation 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.970
 because I testify that they are jealous of God but not according to 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.009
 science 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.160
 because ignoring God's justice and trying to establish his own no 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.659
 they have subjected themselves to the justice of God 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.389
 because the end of the law and is christ for justice everyone who believes 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.739
 because of the justice that is by the law of Moses, he writes 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 the man who does these things will live by them 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620
 but the justice that is for the happy and so 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 do not say in your heart who will ascend to heaven 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.050
 this is to bring down to Christ 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 or who will descend into the abyss 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.830
 this is to make your life Christ from the dead 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.400
 more than it says 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.910
 near you is the word in your mouth and in your heart 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.980
 this is the word of faith that we preach 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 that if you confess it is with your mouth that Jesus is the Lord 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.800
 and believe a hundred heart that God raised him from the dead will be saved 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.840
 because with the heart one believes for justice but with the mouth one confesses 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.410
 for salvation 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.900
 Well, the writing says 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.200
 whoever believes in him will not be ashamed 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.810
 because there is no difference between Jew and Greek because the same as the Lord of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 everyone is rich to all who invoke it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.630
 because everyone who invoke the name of the Lord will be saved 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.880
 as they will invoke the one in whom they have not believed 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 and how they will believe in the one they have not heard 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.870
 and how they will go without someone preaching to them 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.690
 and how they will preach if they were not sent as it is written 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.360
 when beautiful are the feet of those who announce the peace of those who announce 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.050
 good news 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 but not all obeyed the gospel 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.200
 Well, Isaiah says 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.120
 sr kiel has believed our ad 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.090
 so faith is to be able to hear and elude by the word of God 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.990
 but I say they have not heard 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.150
 rather well 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.720
 all over the land their voice has come out and even the ends of the earth their 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.810
 words 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.069
 I also say 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.349
 has not known rael studies 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.760
 First of all Moses says and I will provoke you to jealousy with a people who do not 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.569
 it's town 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 with foolish people I will provoke to anger 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.090
 and Isaiah says resolutely I went to the liver of those who did not seek me 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.969
 I manifested to those who did not ask for me 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.949
 but about israel says 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.039
 all day long I extended my hands to a rebellious people and
