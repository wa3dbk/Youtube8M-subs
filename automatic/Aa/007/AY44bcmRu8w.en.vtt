00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.640
 samsung galaxy s3 and the sony xperia m 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.440
 are both devices in trijntje in between 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.420
 the country and the middle segment 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.130
 history that costs more than 200 euros 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.929
 I play you just under 200 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.499
 euro vegetables price difference is not so 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.359
 big 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.739
 then really matters a lot 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.810
 devices on paper also or in the same 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:25.449
 specifications and in this review please go 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.339
 see which you can buy better but 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.050
 design stands out that history 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.489
 is typical Samsung phone and also 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.079
 actually looks like any other 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.180
 samsung phones at the moment 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.620
 back is a bit sticky and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.030
 slippery 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 also takes fingerprints quickly 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.180
 we are not that charmed and very much 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.130
 I play you m is that we have done better 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.860
 has a rubbery back that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.450
 group feels comfortable and with it 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.820
 dictate and for us a bit 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.410
 better built what stands out is that xp 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.670
 and what is large despite the screen 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.030
 exactly the same size for both devices 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.829
 is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.780
 come to that ixperium them buttons again 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.820
 has to sit on the screen while is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.500
 has cups under the screen 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.900
 with that you keep a little more with the donkey 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.149
 screen space so that format 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.189
 a disadvantage of xperia m because you have 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.469
 just a big device with effective 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.729
 less screen size stadie pity 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.429
 both devices have a 4 inch 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.289
 screen about year evolution or at the xperia 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.389
 m is the fullway roads and revolution is 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.009
 there is another travel pixel underneath 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:19.329
 number of rows of pixels 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.799
 but well the difference is not whole 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.389
 great sharpness already in the image woman and 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.179
 is just a bit different 

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:27.189
 xperia m has a screen that is nothing whole 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.200
 clear is pretty bad contrast 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.119
 and a little deeper under the housing 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 light which also reduces the viewing angle 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.229
 and the screen or roll just doesn't quite work 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.579
 we think is very beautiful and for this 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.560
 segment actually a little bit 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.549
 substandard well when the big history is 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.619
 that is different 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.389
 it has a screen that is nice and clear 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.170
 is good viewing angle has beautiful colors 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.499
 displays 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.450
 contrast that yes fine is not very 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.159
 good but just good enough as with 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.689
 the xp and therefore not so 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.670
 so for that matter in terms of screen in it 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.219
 Galaxy History is clear 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 furthermore, the galaxy s3 i has a whole one 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.789
 interface other than the xperia m xperia 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.869
 m has many sony interface 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.580
 closer to the standard android 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.080
 interface remains and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.310
 therefore a little cleaner ' is also a bit faster 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.290
 works because it just on min 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.509
 added to the galaxy s3 is it 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.220
 touchwiz interface that is both graphical 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.870
 much more functionally 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.850
 brain got things on android 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.470
 my just got a little slower 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.180
 we also don't like it very much 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.640
 look and lots of features you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.560
 get everything set you up for example 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.910
 A feature that also turns the device on 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.470
 stays as long as you look at it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.180
 all those smart functions are in place 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.100
 it is functional , it is better 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.710
 only it makes the device again 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.930
 slow down and after that sit something 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.040
 less beautiful therefore our terms 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.710
 In that respect he would rather the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.050
 sony interface in terms of performance is the 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.760
 So something less good has to come with it 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.040
 with that interface when attributing 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.240
 with almost the same processor with the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.490
 first it 's on 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.660
 So look it up, that's why it's called something 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.610
 different but in principle it's normal 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.140
 with the dual core processor with an out 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.000
 2005 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 cgp that is there with the s3 ie something 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 less quickly in daily use than one 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.100
 side if your applications are going to strength 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.170
 then seems to be friends faster 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.950
 even with browsers the history 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.450
 fine 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.280
 also applies to the xperia m both 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 devices are just fine 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.610
 level for a segment the first reader 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.250
 yes between heavy things just something 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.870
 faster xperia m is with rectory in it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.250
 party everyday use with something faster 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.830
 and you don't have to put it all on 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.050
 like all even sides, the galaxy has s3 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.269
 so hero the built-in lt 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.190
 4g new network technology with which 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.780
 can use the internet much faster 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.209
 also better range is more stable network 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.680
 should have all 3 pro of large 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.030
 the providers of the netherlands are on this 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.190
 moment rolling out 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 So soon you will be there throughout 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.880
 the Netherlands 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.470
 now in large parts of the Netherlands hall 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.540
 this makes the galaxy history a bit more 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.130
 future-proof than the xperia and because that 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.200
 does not have that you play him has nfc 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.480
 as you can see from the back 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.580
 I have Galaxy S3 not good that NFC 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.920
 connections that are as far as we are concerned 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.959
 worth less than 4g connections 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.120
 but both have so in that regard 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.530
 a thing for and against 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.299
 camera of both devices is a 5 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.180
 megapixel camera with flash with 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.610
 autofocus 720 p film function so in terms of 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.930
 specifications completely the same 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.519
 photos of your pixie is 3 are maybe 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.710
 just a little better but they both find it 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.870
 not very good for a 5 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.790
 camera and certainly not the best camera 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.260
 in this segment but the galaxy s ii the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.120
 winter so just around 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680
 in conclusion, the xperia m is perhaps 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.540
 slightly better in design 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.310
 the build quality is a little better device 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.960
 feels nicer but otherwise wins the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 ps3 actually in most areas 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.130
 on the interface 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.080
 device is but in terms of speed 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.120
 The same has ltd addition 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.200
 camera is slightly better the screen 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.060
 a bit better 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.520
 that's why he would already go for the galaxy s3 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.260
 what he did a few tens more 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.300
 in our opinion that is worth it if you 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.530
 not worth what some might cause 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.910
 i play you him 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.330
 is just just on cheaper and also one 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.330
 great device
