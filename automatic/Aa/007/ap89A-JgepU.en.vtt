00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.290
 emanuele you are examining 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.390
 maturity at the scientific and high school 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.520
 to bring about ten a little unusual 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.170
 here we talk a little about her or the metesis but 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.160
 it is based above all on an experiment 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.770
 that I realized 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.770
 then I sent a balloon 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.930
 stratosphere wool at 30,000 112 that 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.520
 integrates height as the idea of was born 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.710
 make such a paper 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.050
 first of all the idea came to me 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.789
 looking happy with the gartner 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.150
 paratrooper wall street that you are 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.220
 launched from the 40 km stratosphere e 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.790
 that day seeing the video he has 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.140
 made the earth the curvature all 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.630
 those but of omissions partners 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.360
 excited ciak and I decided to recreate 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.040
 something similar in my own small way 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.840
 get the same results for 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.690
 film or photograph the earth from 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.340
 tell us how you made it 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.200
 then I mainly drugged myself 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.899
 got a weather balloon and gene 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.630
 about two meters in diameter was inflated 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.579
 with slight to this ball and I have 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.060
 a box touched a shoe 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.920
 made to me by a little bag 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.869
 those that are used for children 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.569
 which thermally insulated to resist 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.689
 at low temperatures and inside 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.759
 this bag inserted in gp2 gps and two 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.079
 camcorders for video cameras for 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.179
 resume entire journey and the GPS for 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.659
 tell me the position of the ball e 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.579
 so once it exploded to 30 thousand 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.450
 meters fell to earth and will succeed 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.880
 go and retrieve it and beyond these things 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.679
 in silico also sensors for measuring 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.639
 pressure the temperature at with 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.139
 the height that helped some do not have 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.279
 done all by myself 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.899
 how the two teachers reacted 

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:53.209
 when you told him about your idea 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.569
 then initially of the truth not 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.909
 I didn't even understand what this was in 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.310
 what an experiment consisted of because the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.749
 apple every day see a student who 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.359
 he says I want to send a ball into the 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:08.060
 space later when they discovered 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.170
 actually what was wringing seeing 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 video of clan people already done 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.690
 they were all very excited to hope 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 and in truth not all professors 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.450
 they believed I could do something 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.400
 similar 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.020
 but once I succeeded 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.230
 actually show from point i 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.550
 videos were enthusiastic 13 minutes on the web 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.920
 I read that to make his own 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.230
 project is due to buy a balloon 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 meteorological a helium cylinder one 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.060
 camera with gps sensor integrated in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.830
 a gps but how much it costs economically 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.180
 make such a paper 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.019
 the total cost is around 200 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.910
 EUR 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.640
 how long did it take you to realize it e 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.549
 what difficulties met to understand 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.739
 how to do it took about a month and 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.569
 half two to understand the technique with which 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.630
 throw it as far as ed and mestre 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.989
 all these data I used here 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.140
 about two months to figure out how to do it later 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.480
 of which came the most bureaucratic part 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 in fact I had to ask for the permits to 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 7 and different airport entities for 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.730
 to be able to launch this balloon and to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.850
 request these seven permits 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.370
 it took me four months to request them 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.420
 all and therefore a total of 5 6 months of 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.799
 work 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.480
 what did you feel when you saw the images 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.180
 of the earth from space 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.459
 the first thing that came to mind is 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.799
 was to understand how small we are of 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.079
 facing the exit of the earth as it is 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.700
 made to recover the machine and those 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.410
 that we can call the remains of the two 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 atesina to the box the loan is one 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.870
 space I attached a parachute in 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.630
 so that the fall maybe braked and not 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.730
 arrived at 60 70 kilometers per hour on 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.660
 spal only with this parachute 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.890
 slowing the fall and fell into it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.280
 a field of potatoes I think big fairy 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.610
 so a gps signal I managed to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.680
 understand the exact location 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.580
 the two actually happened every 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.440
 balloon and traveling 250 kilometers in 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.840
 machine if it does not respond recover it e 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.180
 all was intact, fortunately that 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.500
 what you will bring before the commission 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.540
 I bring a presentation made in power 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.329
 point with a video that lasts about three 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.520
 minutes and my experience emanuele 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.170
 how the members have gone enough 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.550
 well I got 38 45ths then with 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.530
 about half past eight 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.900
 I can complain about what you want to do next 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.320
 maturity I have a pretty clear idea 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.510
 I would like to try the listening of is over 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.730
 physics emanuele on your site layer 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.320
 Puntoit expenses I saw that in the zeal 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.330
 that you threw into the space put one 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.690
 tell us about your father francesco 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.330
 because the ball launched on March 29 and 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.760
 Papa Francesco had just been 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.590
 recently become a dad and even if not 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.860
 but his figure is very religious 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.770
 and it hit a lot of people 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.680
 and then I decided to include in mine 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.030
 parachute in my father my box 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.470
 in addition to future francesco dads also the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.660
 photo of my grandmother who died six years 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.860
 does the single general say to 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.720
 meet her and fate ladies you know is 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.790
 once the ball has fallen is 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.910
 returned land that landed in via san 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.910
 Francis
