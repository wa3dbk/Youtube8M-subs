00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
boring quickly that's one fear that I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.349 
boring quickly that's one fear that I
have<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:29.099> know<00:03:29.220> whereas<00:03:29.519> favela<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.150> things

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
have you know whereas favela and things

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.879 
have you know whereas favela and things
again<00:03:30.599> they're<00:03:30.780> very<00:03:30.959> versatile<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.650> sort<00:03:31.859> of

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
again they're very versatile and sort of

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.589 
again they're very versatile and sort of
maps<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.340> there's<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> lot<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.150> life<00:03:33.359> in<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599

long<00:03:33.959> longevity<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:35.040> them<00:03:35.190> whereas<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.519> think

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
long longevity in them whereas I think

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.490 
long longevity in them whereas I think
these<00:03:35.790> kind<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.120> maps<00:03:36.329> make<00:03:36.660> runner<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.200> their

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
these kind of maps make runner to their

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.960 
these kind of maps make runner to their
steam<00:03:37.739> very<00:03:38.010> quick<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.609> is
