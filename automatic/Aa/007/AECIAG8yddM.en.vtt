00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
believe i'm pretty sure they're all done

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
believe i'm pretty sure they're all done
with<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> ak-12<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.460> its<00:00:26.609> exact<00:00:26.910> setup<00:00:27.150> so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with the ak-12 with its exact setup so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.570 
with the ak-12 with its exact setup so
what<00:00:27.840> i'm<00:00:27.930> using<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> ak-12<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
what i'm using on the ak-12 is the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.240 
what i'm using on the ak-12 is the
foregrip<00:00:30.560> attachment<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:31.679> i<00:00:31.830> heard<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
foregrip attachment which i heard is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.240 
foregrip attachment which i heard is
probably<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.880> best<00:00:33.649> attachment<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> use<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
probably the best attachment to use and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
probably the best attachment to use and
with<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> AK<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.440> deadly

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
with it with the AK is just so deadly

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
with it with the AK is just so deadly
because<00:00:38.100> there's<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:39.180> recoil<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> your

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
because there's like no recoil and your

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
because there's like no recoil and your
guns<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.340> target<00:00:41.610> every<00:00:41.879> time

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
guns it's just it's on target every time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
guns it's just it's on target every time
so<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> silencer<00:00:44.180> keeps

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so I use that and I use a silencer keeps

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
so I use that and I use a silencer keeps
you<00:00:45.329> off<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.480> map<00:00:45.840> even<00:00:46.469> though<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you off the map even though that's not

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
you off the map even though that's not
really<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> big<00:00:47.489> thing<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.730> me<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.360> don't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
really a big thing for me but I don't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
really a big thing for me but I don't
know<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.050> been<00:00:49.230> working<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.680> me<00:00:49.739> um<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
know it's been working for me um if you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
know it's been working for me um if you
wanted<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> mix<00:00:51.570> things<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> feel<00:00:52.289> like

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
wanted to mix things up you feel like

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990 
wanted to mix things up you feel like
you're<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.649> enough<00:00:52.829> damage<00:00:53.000> obviously

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you're not do enough damage obviously

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.160

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
recommend starting with hardline if you

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.820 
recommend starting with hardline if you
guys<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:18.900> aren't<00:02:19.170> too<00:02:19.470> worried<00:02:19.770> about

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
guys really aren't too worried about

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
guys really aren't too worried about
like<00:02:20.160> or<00:02:20.370> refusing<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:20.819> an<00:02:20.970> assault<00:02:21.270> shake

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
like or refusing like an assault shake

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.970 
like or refusing like an assault shake
or<00:02:21.569> something<00:02:21.660> I'd<00:02:22.020> probably<00:02:22.170> put<00:02:22.410> focus<00:02:22.709> on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
or something I'd probably put focus on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.930 
or something I'd probably put focus on
over<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> hard<00:02:23.370> line<00:02:23.520> which<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:23.910> here

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
over a hard line which is right here

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.339 
over a hard line which is right here
they're<00:02:24.480> about<00:02:24.599> two<00:02:24.780> points<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.260> really

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
they're about two points so it's really

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.500 
they're about two points so it's really
up<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.610> you'll<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.940> use<00:02:27.090> focus<00:02:27.270> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
dead I you get to if you get a bunch of

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.059

kills<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> row<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:07.620> yeah<00:03:07.769> it's<00:03:07.830> what<00:03:08.010> it

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
kills in a row I think yeah it's what it

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.229 
kills in a row I think yeah it's what it
is<00:03:08.130> consecutive<00:03:08.610> kills<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.940> always<00:03:09.120> thought

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
is consecutive kills I always thought

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.520 
is consecutive kills I always thought
it's<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.630> consecutive<00:03:10.110> hits<00:03:10.290> but

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
it's like consecutive hits but

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's like consecutive hits but
consecutive<00:03:11.250> kills<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> increases<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
consecutive kills it increases the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.759 
consecutive kills it increases the
chance<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> deal<00:03:12.720> more<00:03:13.019> bonus<00:03:13.380> name<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:13.620> was

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
chance to deal more bonus name which was

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.650 
chance to deal more bonus name which was
really<00:03:14.010> good<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.670> you're<00:03:15.299> like<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.599> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
this because you pretty much keeps you

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.020 
this because you pretty much keeps you
off<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.560> grid<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.890> whole<00:03:35.040> time<00:03:35.250> another

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
off the grid the whole time another

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.130 
off the grid the whole time another
thing<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.269> would<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.510> actually<00:03:36.630> pretty<00:03:36.989> good

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
thing that would be actually pretty good

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.289 
thing that would be actually pretty good
as<00:03:37.319> stealth<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.730> wanted<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.209> could

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
as stealth if you wanted to you could

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.940 
as stealth if you wanted to you could
throw<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.350> place<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.890> these

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
throw that on and place one of these

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.559 
throw that on and place one of these
other<00:03:41.160> ones<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.609> when<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.239> kill<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.480> it

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
other ones because when you kill them it

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.610 
other ones because when you kill them it
doesn't<00:03:42.690> show<00:03:42.930> where<00:03:43.079> they<00:03:43.170> died<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
doesn't show where they died it so

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.750

doesn't show the skull and the other

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.129 
doesn't show the skull and the other
team<00:03:44.970> has<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.299> no<00:03:45.420> idea<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.780> someone<00:03:45.930> just

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139
