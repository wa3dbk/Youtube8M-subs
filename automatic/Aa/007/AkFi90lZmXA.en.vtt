00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.238
 Do you remember when I first realized 

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.659
 Your computer is more 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.742
 From just a display device and a keyboard? 

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:23.325
 That between mouse click and video playback, 

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.598
 There was something picked up by your destination, 

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:26.428
 And understand it 

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:27.880
 And worked on its implementation? 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.270
 What is this thing? 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.007
 Is it a goblin? 

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.665
 Let's imagine that we can shrink 

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:35.141
 To the size of the electron 

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.894
 And we inject ourselves in a mouse click. 

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:39.531
 If you dismantle your mouse, 

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.193
 You'll see it is a very simple machine. 

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:43.444
 Have two buttons 

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:46.747
 System for motion detection and distance. 

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.163
 You may have a optical mouse 

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:50.868
 These measurements are made with lights and sensors, 

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:52.958
 But the oldest did so with a rubber ball 

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.576
 And some plastic wheels. 

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:56.325
 The same principle 

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.914
 When you click your mouse button, 

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.716
 It sends a message to the computer 

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.825
 Information about its location. 

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.491
 When your click is received with a mouse, 

00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.880
 They are processed by the primary I / O subsystem. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.444
 This subsystem works like Ayoun and Azan 

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.053
 And the mouth of my computer. 

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:13.958
 It basically provides a method for the computer 

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.443
 To interact with its environment. 

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.090
 But it also acts as a buffer 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.501
 To keep the processor from controlling the jams. 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.811
 In this case, the input and output subsystem decides 

00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:25.942
 Your mouse click is very important 

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:28.939
 So it interrupts the processor 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.075
 "Hey, wizard! I have a click here" 

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:34.327
 Processor, or CPU, 

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.522
 Is the mastermind of the entire computer. 

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:39.072
 Just as your brain does not cover your entire body, 

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:41.577
 The CPU does not cover the entire computer, 

00:01:41.577 --> 00:01:44.262
 But they run the show all the time. 

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:46.506
 CPU function, full function, 

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.444
 Instructions are retrieved from memory 

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:50.451
 And implementation. 

00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:52.380
 So when you write continuously 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.610
 Perhaps very quickly, 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.088
 60 words per minute For example, 

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.090
 The CPU will fetch and execute 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.137
 Instructions in milliseconds. 

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:02.176
 Yes, the milliers every second: 

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.982
 Instructions To move the mouse on the screen, 

00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:07.145
 To run the clock on your desktop, 

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:08.892
 To operate your Internet radio, 

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:11.145
 Manage files that you edit on your hard drive, 

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:12.900
 And much more. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.160
 Your computer processor performs multiple tasks unimaginable! 

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:17.613
 "But my God 

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:18.909
 There is a very important mouse click 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.030
 Coming on its way now! 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.560
 Let's do everything and deal with it! " 

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:24.604
 There are programs for everything 

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:26.336
 Performed by the wizard. 

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.058
 A special program for the mouse, 

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:29.092
 Hourly program, 

00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:30.303
 For radio stations over the Internet, 

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:33.136
 And handling letters sent from the keyboard. 

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.688
 At first, each program was written by man 

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.906
 In a programming language that a person can read, 

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:38.765
 Such as Java, 

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.798
 The Plus Plus, 

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:41.219
 Or Python. 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.741
 But human programs take up a lot of space 

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:47.450
 And contains a lot of information is not necessary for the computer, 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.191
 Where they were collected and made smaller 

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.653
 And stored in bits of zeros and zeros in memory. 

00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:55.410
 The CPU realizes that it needs help 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.411
 To learn how to handle this mouse click, 

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.380
 So they look for the title of the mouse program 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.755
 A request is sent to the memory subsystem 

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.179
 For instructions stored there. 

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:07.216
 All mouse driver help instructions 

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:09.742
 Were duly brought and implemented. 

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:12.113
 And that is not until the end of the story! 

00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:14.654
 Because the processor knows it was clicked with a mouse 

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.216
 When the pointer was above a picture 

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.177
 Or button on the display, 

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:21.248
 Thus, the processor requests the display program memory 

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:23.353
 To see what that button is. 

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.601
 Then the processor should ask for memory 

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.437
 Program button, 

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:28.948
 Which means that the processor needs 

00:03:28.948 --> 00:03:30.688
 To the display program again 

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.860
 To show the video associated with the button, 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.742
 So things go. 

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:37.487
 And let's just transfer that there are a lot of programs involved 

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:39.472
 Before you even see the button on the screen 

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:41.379
 Lights up when you click it. 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.848
 So, just a simple task like clicking a mouse 

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.216
 Means passing through all these critical components 

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.196
 From your computer engineering: 

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.238
 And accessories, 

00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:51.047
 The basic input and output system, 

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:52.379
 The processor, 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.154
 Programs, 

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.140
 Memory, 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.133
 Without the intervention of one imp.
