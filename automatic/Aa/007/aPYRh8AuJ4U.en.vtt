00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.029
 I will show you as always 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 a super can also step into it 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.959
 the Steinheimer RTL push the program Hammer 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 you can do that at SchÃ¶nborn in the old documents 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.689
 still to describe pictures 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.010
 that's exactly what I have already done 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
 then she has to die the program 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 and an insist 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.660
 Network joined 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 at my server explains outdoor area 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.260
 Microsoft's 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.940
 Lehmann 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.210
 Expected us dollar 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.400
 Dollars or 3 0 1 Duisburg - Ribery Knoll 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 so stands in the so-called Usenet Zurich not sad 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.060
 if, however, the Prinzipalmarkt 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 even the VIPs pick it up 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.710
 must now have their wish to the banks with me it would be 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 this crisis 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 then you have to take care with 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.590
 Our parents actually already suggest places they sometimes cares 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.080
 it should be around 4 but it is not Collins Reimer's job 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 that is honest dialogue now shows 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.360
 First of all, my Kreft would have to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 and now 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
 for pleasure 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.679
 Neil McCullagh little laugh downloads 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.999
 but he did not have to squander our name called Multiplayer Beta Ursula 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.089
 Wyss earlier 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 and the anesthesia machine and here also the exiles Anna 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.719
 around 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.469
 Marienhagen Terex made 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.149
 and around 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.219
 have there 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.449
 must a 9 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.549
 without being attached to the left then the parts that Iran intervene to 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.649
 expect 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.499
 growth 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.129
 or exile 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.779
 and they have learned a lot 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.920
 Wasdin you log in and then these limits appear 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.369
 then share 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.739
 A tedious retrieve signed everything good 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.689
 so smoke 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.689
 Here's the Sea in the final 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 some half lying 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.229
 I already did that then you have to go to a strong one 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.689
 Bottomed out 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.689
 and always my big go 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.679
 the normal own home in Munich the son 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.069
 Of course, it does not work 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.919
 in the coastal area for about 15% is Malta 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.579
 from nana-shi is like that 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 and have been advancing for years but could as well 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.719
 Gerald is all Japan 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.090
 so keep abiding archive and it takes august need 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.079
 in an existing network 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.279
 the spare choice you always have about me is all coincidence
