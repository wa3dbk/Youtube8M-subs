definitely<00:02:01.320> has<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.860> velvet<00:02:02.579> texture<00:02:04.009> but<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
definitely has a velvet texture but it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
definitely has a velvet texture but it
blends<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.329> nice<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.110> find

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
blends in really really nice I do find

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
blends in really really nice I do find
that<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.280> dries<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.090> fast<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> have

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that this dries really fast so you have

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
that this dries really fast so you have
to<00:02:10.020> work<00:02:10.170> fast<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.060> does<00:02:12.270> give

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
to work fast with it but it does give

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.770 
to work fast with it but it does give
a<00:02:12.780> velvety<00:02:13.740> matte<00:02:14.190> finish<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.300> still<00:02:15.570> has<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
a velvety matte finish it still has a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.170 
a velvety matte finish it still has a
bit<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:17.720> luminous<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.280> is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
bit of that like luminous to it so it is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.810 
bit of that like luminous to it so it is
matte<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.200> still<00:02:22.500> gives<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.220> really

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
matte but it still gives you a really

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.030 
matte but it still gives you a really
nice<00:02:24.170> glow<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.830> super<00:02:26.760> super<00:02:26.940> matte

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
nice glow so it's not super super matte

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.010 
nice glow so it's not super super matte
but<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.250> definitely<00:02:29.490> matte<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.870> going

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
but it is definitely matte now I'm going

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
first I did use the Beauty Blender but

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.440 
first I did use the Beauty Blender but
what<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> had<00:02:50.459> found<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> Beauty<00:02:51.300> Blender

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
what I had found that the Beauty Blender

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.170 
what I had found that the Beauty Blender
was<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.980> wasn't<00:02:53.190> giving<00:02:53.610> me<00:02:53.640> enough

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
was that it wasn't giving me enough

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.199 
was that it wasn't giving me enough
coverage<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> wanted<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.400> sheared<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> out

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
coverage that I wanted it sheared it out

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.270 
coverage that I wanted it sheared it out
way<00:02:57.660> too<00:02:57.720> much<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:59.010> did<00:02:59.580> not<00:02:59.730> like<00:03:00.090> using<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
way too much so I did not like using the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.090 
way too much so I did not like using the
Beauty<00:03:02.280> Blender<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.640> apply<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.330> foundation

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
Beauty Blender to apply this foundation

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.190 
Beauty Blender to apply this foundation
yes<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> Beauty<00:03:06.150> Blender<00:03:06.300> did<00:03:06.750> blend<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
yes so the Beauty Blender did blend it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.380 
yes so the Beauty Blender did blend it
out<00:03:07.350> way<00:03:07.800> too<00:03:07.860> much<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.489> me<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.850> decided<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
out way too much for me so I decided to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.990 
out way too much for me so I decided to
go<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.260> second<00:03:10.890> coat<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.850> was

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
go in with a second coat and it was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180 
go in with a second coat and it was
better<00:03:12.300> with<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> second<00:03:12.959> coat<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> will<00:03:13.920> say

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
better with a second coat now I will say

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
better with a second coat now I will say
that<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.640> foundation<00:03:14.850> did<00:03:15.630> even<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.260> my

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
that this foundation did even out my

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.250 
that this foundation did even out my
skin<00:03:16.500> tone<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:18.030> didn't<00:03:18.330> cover<00:03:18.600> up<00:03:18.780> any<00:03:19.140> of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
skin tone but it didn't cover up any of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.800 
skin tone but it didn't cover up any of
my<00:03:19.380> imperfections<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> did<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.540> in

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
my imperfections so I did have to go in

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.840 
my imperfections so I did have to go in
and<00:03:22.049> use<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:25.940> concealer<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.120> hide<00:03:27.840> all<00:03:28.170> those

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
and use a concealer to hide all those

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.729 
and use a concealer to hide all those
imperfections<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.510> had<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
imperfections that I had now on the

imperfections that I had now on the
other<00:03:31.980> half<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.489> my<00:03:32.610> face<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.120> decided<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.810> try

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
other half of my face I decided to try

brush<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.450> did<00:03:39.720> find<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> coverage

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650

brush and I did find that the coverage
was<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.130> lot<00:03:41.489> better<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.660> blended<00:03:43.049> out

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
was a lot better and it just blended out

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.250 
was a lot better and it just blended out
really<00:03:43.530> nice<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:44.100> me<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:45.000> prefer<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.600> use

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
really fast with this foundation I found

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.670 
really fast with this foundation I found
that<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.760> dried<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.450> really<00:03:54.690> fast<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.470> be

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that it dried really really fast so be

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.630 
that it dried really really fast so be
aware<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:57.209> foundation<00:03:58.640> definitely

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
aware of that this foundation definitely

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.460 
aware of that this foundation definitely
evens<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.120> your<00:04:00.180> skin<00:04:00.630> tone<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.230> says

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
evens out your skin tone like it says

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.759 
evens out your skin tone like it says
but<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.730> definitely<00:04:02.970> not<00:04:03.540> full<00:04:04.320> coverage

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
but it is definitely not full coverage

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
not super super matte but it's

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.659 
not super super matte but it's
definitely<00:05:51.419> matte<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:52.410> is<00:05:52.620> a<00:05:52.919> light

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
definitely matte this is a light

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.300 
definitely matte this is a light
coverage<00:05:54.150> foundation<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:55.169> can<00:05:55.440> add<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> second

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
coverage foundation you can add a second

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.490

layer<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:56.790> build<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:57.090> up<00:05:57.180> to<00:05:57.240> medium<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:58.080> don't

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
layer to build it up to medium I don't

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.560 
layer to build it up to medium I don't
think<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:58.800> can<00:05:58.919> go<00:05:59.130> to<00:05:59.669> a<00:05:59.700> full<00:06:00.030> coverage<00:06:00.240> with
