he<00:03:21.440> was<00:03:21.680> introduced<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.519> Kakashi<00:03:22.940> garden<00:03:23.540> our

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
he was introduced and Kakashi garden our

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.690 
he was introduced and Kakashi garden our
ridges<00:03:24.320> can't<00:03:24.530> imagine<00:03:24.980> kishimoto<00:03:25.430> just

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
ridges can't imagine kishimoto just

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.670 
ridges can't imagine kishimoto just
letting<00:03:26.000> him<00:03:26.030> die<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.540> villain<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.530> he's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
letting him die a villain so he's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.020 
letting him die a villain so he's
probably<00:03:27.860> gonna<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.340> something<00:03:28.670> good<00:03:28.760> before

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
probably gonna do something good before

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.050 
probably gonna do something good before
he<00:03:29.390> before<00:03:30.140> he<00:03:30.320> actually<00:03:30.590> does<00:03:30.980> die<00:03:31.340> which<00:03:31.850> I'm

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
he before he actually does die which I'm

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.759 
he before he actually does die which I'm
pretty<00:03:32.330> sure<00:03:32.480> he<00:03:32.870> will<00:03:33.110> by<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.380> end<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.680> the

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
pretty sure he will by the end of the

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.640 
pretty sure he will by the end of the
series<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.340> i'm<00:03:35.150> pretty<00:03:35.570> sure<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> next

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
series and i'm pretty sure that the next

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.830 
series and i'm pretty sure that the next
coming<00:03:36.890> up<00:03:37.100> chapter<00:03:37.400> will<00:03:37.970> show<00:03:38.269> what<00:03:38.630> he's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
coming up chapter will show what he's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.210

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
do for the Ninja world before he

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.600 
do for the Ninja world before he
actually<00:03:42.290> does<00:03:42.590> kick<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.040> bucket<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:43.459> now

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the idea but then I realized there's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.070
