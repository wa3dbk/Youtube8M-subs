apart I always I always either just hook
up<00:04:37.849> with<00:04:38.000> Rick<00:04:38.270> or<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.509> couple<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.930> guys<00:04:39.080> or<00:04:39.530> I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
up with Rick or a couple of guys or I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.219 
up with Rick or a couple of guys or I
would<00:04:39.889> go<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.099> girl<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.810> whoever<00:04:41.810> was<00:04:42.020> there

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
would go to girl and whoever was there

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.260 
would go to girl and whoever was there
we<00:04:42.380> would<00:04:42.500> go<00:04:42.680> skate<00:04:43.069> and<00:04:43.310> we<00:04:43.580> would<00:04:43.699> go<00:04:43.819> films

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
we would go skate and we would go films

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.450 
we would go skate and we would go films
and<00:04:44.479> so<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.169> was<00:04:45.349> just<00:04:45.410> skating<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:45.979> everybody

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
and so I was just skating with everybody

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.820 
and so I was just skating with everybody
and<00:04:46.880> he<00:04:47.000> just<00:04:47.180> never<00:04:47.330> was<00:04:47.630> really<00:04:48.020> around<00:04:48.380> I

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
and he just never was really around I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.029 
and he just never was really around I
think<00:04:49.729> when<00:04:49.940> he<00:04:50.270> didn't<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.110> full<00:04:51.440> part<00:04:51.770> in

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
think when he didn't have a full part in

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.879 
think when he didn't have a full part in
goldfish<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:53.030> think<00:04:53.419> maybe<00:04:53.599> he<00:04:53.810> realized<00:04:54.289> not

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
goldfish I think maybe he realized not

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.290 
goldfish I think maybe he realized not
that<00:04:55.039> he<00:04:55.099> fucked<00:04:55.370> up<00:04:55.580> but<00:04:55.849> that<00:04:56.030> would<00:04:56.210> have

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
that he fucked up but that would have

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.810 
that he fucked up but that would have
been<00:04:56.509> a<00:04:56.840> good<00:04:57.139> thing<00:04:57.199> for<00:04:57.620> him<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:58.190> have<00:04:58.520> done

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
been a good thing for him to have done

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.210 
been a good thing for him to have done
you<00:04:59.539> know<00:04:59.630> people<00:04:59.960> were<00:05:00.169> probably<00:05:00.770> bummed

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
you know people were probably bummed

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.620 
you know people were probably bummed
that<00:05:01.370> they<00:05:01.550> didn't<00:05:01.820> see<00:05:01.970> more<00:05:02.180> footage<00:05:02.509> of
