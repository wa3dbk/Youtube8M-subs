00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
which goes over some of the beautiful

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440 
which goes over some of the beautiful
art<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.130> game<00:03:44.310> some<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> concept

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
art in the game some of the concept

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.680 
art in the game some of the concept
designs<00:03:46.580> there's<00:03:47.580> like<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.730> think<00:03:47.790> 40<00:03:48.150> pages<00:03:48.420> of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
designs there's like I think 40 pages of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.760 
designs there's like I think 40 pages of
it<00:03:48.780> exclusive<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.860> edition<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.530> think

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
it exclusive to this edition so I think

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.890 
it exclusive to this edition so I think
it's<00:03:52.860> pretty<00:03:52.980> awesome<00:03:53.239> in<00:03:54.239> addition<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
it's pretty awesome in addition to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.470 
it's pretty awesome in addition to
obviously<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.650> strategy<00:03:56.459> guide<00:03:56.489> portion<00:03:56.940> and

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
obviously the strategy guide portion and

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.110 
obviously the strategy guide portion and
stats<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:59.250> game<00:03:59.459> will<00:03:59.580> probably<00:03:59.910> still

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
stats this game will probably still

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.390 
stats this game will probably still
continue<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> evolve<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.410> I'm<00:04:01.530> sure<00:04:01.770> loss<00:04:02.160> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
continue to evolve so I'm sure loss of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.770 
continue to evolve so I'm sure loss of
this<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.670> lots<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.300> numbers<00:04:03.510> will

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
this and lots of these numbers will

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.750 
this and lots of these numbers will
change<00:04:03.840> over<00:04:04.200> time<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.520> quest

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
change over time but the quest

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.820 
change over time but the quest
objectives<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.020> guides<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.560> stuff<00:04:07.709> like

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
objectives and guides and stuff like

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.020 
objectives and guides and stuff like
that<00:04:07.890> will<00:04:08.220> generally<00:04:08.489> probably<00:04:08.790> stand

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
that will generally probably stand

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.840 
that will generally probably stand
strong<00:04:09.770> talks<00:04:10.770> about<00:04:10.950> difficulty<00:04:11.550> levels
