00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 all salute I Yuri Okuny and this and build 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
 and today I will tell and show you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.259
 different special effects from visual 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.259
 effects 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.020
 films in operation 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.050
 so we are talking about making a movie with our own 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.640
 hands I am all related nuances we 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.670
 we live in an era of beautiful cinema 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.400
 flame explosions blood splash virtual 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.080
 cities but all the beautiful effect on 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.769
 the screen can be divided into two 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.640
 parts 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:41.920
 special effects and visual effects fx and 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.470
 vfx wave x 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.839
 the main difference is that the first and fix 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.489
 being created directly on the set 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.220
 the site they are real 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.680
 here can be attributed makeup these explosions 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.479
 Peeler of blood scenery like that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.269
 visual effects are created after 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.030
 filming ruins of cities incredible engineering 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.299
 and the bullet and lightning characters by 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.939
 computer create something that is too long 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.670
 difficult impossible or expensive to do in 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.990
 reality for comparison how will 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.300
 look different effect and if their 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.380
 create with as special effects or as 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.380
 visual effects 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.510
 I hope that after this visual 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.030
 demonstrations you understand the difference work 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.860
 can be in both directions but decide what 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.590
 you will need to use in advance yet 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.960
 before filming as the approach to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.790
 security case from 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.430
 the selected processing direction depends 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.170
 and shooting style, therefore, I recommend everything 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 plan ahead yet 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.860
 dangerous effects like flames or bullets 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.670
 still better to impose in 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 post processing 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.520
 We like to subscribe to everything 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.350
 ask questions in the comments and remove 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.350
 cinema it was my and build
