00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
but at the same time it gives me a lens

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.699 
but at the same time it gives me a lens
and<00:02:28.769> full<00:02:29.280> view<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.380> this

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and full view I like this I like this

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.610 
and full view I like this I like this
one<00:02:31.950> better

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.190 

now<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.920> gonna<00:02:38.100> get<00:02:38.370> my<00:02:38.610> eyelash<00:02:39.200> curler

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
now I'm just gonna get my eyelash curler

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.640 
now I'm just gonna get my eyelash curler
again<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.220> try<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> apply<00:02:42.420> another<00:02:42.780> coat<00:02:43.170> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
again and try to apply another coat of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:59.390 
again and try to apply another coat of
mascara<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:58.040> l'oreal<00:02:59.040> one<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
mascara this is the l'oreal one a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.960 
mascara this is the l'oreal one a
telescopic<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:01.860> hard<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.730> apply

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
telescopic it's really hard to apply

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.710 
telescopic it's really hard to apply
this<00:03:03.030> second<00:03:03.959> coat<00:03:04.230> because<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.540> mascara<00:03:06.540> has

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
this second coat because the mascara has

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.319 
this second coat because the mascara has
already<00:03:07.200> dried<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.310> i<00:03:08.700> think<00:03:08.880> it's

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
already dried up so i think it's

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:22.970 
already dried up so i think it's
impossible<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.560> apply<00:03:11.010> another<00:03:11.250> coat

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.720 

I'll<00:03:23.980> try<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.750> maxfactor

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
I'll try the maxfactor

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:40.590 
I'll try the maxfactor
again<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.510> second<00:03:28.930> time<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:39.360> feel<00:03:40.360> like

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
again for the second time I feel like

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.100 
again for the second time I feel like
the<00:03:41.020> Max<00:03:41.260> Factor<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:42.100> easier<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.360> build<00:03:43.540> up

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
the Max Factor is easier to build up

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.809 
the Max Factor is easier to build up
you<00:03:44.530> can<00:03:44.739> totally<00:03:45.220> apply<00:03:46.060> more<00:03:46.569> code<00:03:47.470> or<00:03:48.010> two

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
you can totally apply more code or two

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.680 
you can totally apply more code or two
codes<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.360> three<00:03:49.660> codes<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.170> think<00:03:50.470> it's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
codes or three codes I think it's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.259 
codes or three codes I think it's
buildable<00:03:52.690> than<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.670> Florian<00:03:54.670> one

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
buildable than the Florian one

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.100 
buildable than the Florian one
