00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.380
 what she noted for herself but us 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.300
 today to hear recommendations from her as 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 choose the right paint for 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 hair 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.370
 hello my name is spiridonov 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.309
 Eugene, I decided to test the paint 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.579
 oriflame chose a color 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.250
 hazelnut chose paint and without 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 palette focused on color in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 catalog 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.300
 Well, color is still a bit on paper 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 distorted and therefore it is better to choose 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 paint themselves with a palette or to have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.789
 consultants you order 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 the paint was a palette and then already the country 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.460
 comparing your hair shade with a touch on 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.710
 palette 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 already choose the color you want as 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.670
 it turned out I chose paint 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.229
 despite the palette and so this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 the shade did not fit my color 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
 hair and it turned out that the roots have a color 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 hair 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 lighter than the ends then the only 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.299
 minus which you noted for yourself that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 I picked the wrong color here 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.090
 what else did not like in principle 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 paint, I think that resistant if even when 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 buy this specially looking after 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.290
 shampoo and balsam for colored hair 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.189
 then the color will last long on the hair and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.630
 long you can not tint it is not 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.649
 restore and now let's talk 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.650
 about the pros 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.080
 I used to buy paint 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.060
 for hair just came to the shops 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.190
 I chose the color that I like 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.950
 like no matter what 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.800
 the factory made borla for itself that color 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 which things to me liked and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.890
 I bought but paint stores I would not 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.740
 Said she is very resilient 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.930
 as for the price category I took 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.130
 different colors like some 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.220
 some did not like 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.350
 but I was just looking for myself that golden 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.550
 middle 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.380
 so before choosing for yourself 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.520
 shade be sure to ask 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.100
 consultants here is a palette and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.220
 choose for yourself the necessary shade in what 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.920
 Pros of paint from oriflame I liked 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.190
 what after staining 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.840
 as if you had a protective film and 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.209
 they got stronger thicker 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.170
 usually after dyeing hair structure 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.850
 spoils they somehow wither becomes 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.019
 thinner but after dyeing paint comp 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.800
 from the company oriflame the opposite hair 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 got stronger and loved the balm 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.290
 which is embedded in a box with 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.790
 paint we now took a box with 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.360
 paint and I'll show you a balm for 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.860
 dyed hairs that are embedded in this 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.019
 paint this balm is very thick well 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.870
 distributed on the hair and enough for 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.660
 for long hair I have short hair 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.320
 and literally all hair very well 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.739
 distributed and after I washed away 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.739
 hair balsam they purchased first 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.950
 good shine 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.549
 volume added and hair structure 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.100
 this is how you paint it 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.560
 need only add here to this 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.500
 shake the bottle all applied very 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 it is easy to just break off the tip and you can 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.989
 even myself 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.290
 of professional skills to apply 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.790
 self at home ok well what about the whole 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.300
 means the first thing to do is 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.180
 consultants take a liter of it 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.380
 be sure to pick up 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.160
 necessary shade to not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.500
 get this well maybe not very 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.400
 positive result both in you and yes 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.270
 so on the second 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.940
 mix paint and third how many minutes 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:36.540
 I held for 30 minutes you can keep the paint 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:39.690
 up to 50 then wash off and wash off with water until 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.630
 states so that the remaining paint is washed away and 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.419
 the water was clear and only after 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.810
 this i apply hair balm 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.300
 You can paint in principle tint 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.639
 roots are needed when a person 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.520
 chooses a light shade of paint 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.810
 roots are dark then you need to choose 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.889
 tint because it's ugly 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:06.660
 when the hair roots are from dew and it is very 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:11.060
 much noticeable if such a defect is not 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:15.060
 there is a measure of washing the paint off the hair 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.539
 once every six months and now we complete our 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.570
 overview 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.200
 in the oriflame directory you can see 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.200
 twenty two shades of paint each can 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.300
 choose a suitable color for yourself 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.710
 it just needs to open a directory or 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.410
 ask your consultants 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.240
 either go to the office at Lunacharsky 10 and 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.760
 choose your shade 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.840
 I wish you good shopping with you and 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.840
