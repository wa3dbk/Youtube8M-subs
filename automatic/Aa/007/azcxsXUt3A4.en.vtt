00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
breaking is the best then you fall

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.149 
breaking is the best then you fall
through<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.030> block<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.690> now<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:57.010> are<00:00:57.129> able

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
through the block and now you are able

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.579 
through the block and now you are able
to<00:00:57.879> see<00:00:58.269> through<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.960> blocks<00:01:02.170> as<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.440> can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
puts them underground of course and they

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.190 
puts them underground of course and they

underground<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.850> make<00:01:46.090> something<00:01:46.330> like

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
underground just make something like

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.540 
underground just make something like
this<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.110> can<00:01:47.200> actually<00:01:47.560> remember<00:01:48.130> where

this so you can actually remember where

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.490 
this so you can actually remember where
you<00:01:48.760> where<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.360> was<00:01:49.630> because<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.170> not<00:01:50.320> always

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
you where it was because it's not always

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.970 
you where it was because it's not always
easy<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:51.010> find<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.520> now<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:53.050> how<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> make<00:01:53.770> it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
easy to find it now on to how to make it

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.920 
easy to find it now on to how to make it
it's<00:01:54.220> really<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:54.730> easy<00:01:54.760> all<00:01:55.480> you<00:01:55.660> have<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.080 
it's really really easy all you have to
go<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.560> all<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.250> go<00:01:57.370> all<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.000> to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
go it all you have to go all you have to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.850 
go it all you have to go all you have to
do<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.620> dig<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.830> hole<00:02:00.640> like<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.530> place<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
do is dig a hole like this place a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.120 
do is dig a hole like this place a
glowstone<00:02:03.550> block<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.110> x-ray<00:02:05.470> actually<00:02:05.920> works

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
glowstone block the x-ray actually works

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.540 
glowstone block the x-ray actually works
of<00:02:06.370> a<00:02:07.110> rendering<00:02:08.110> thing<00:02:08.739> in<00:02:08.979> Minecraft<00:02:09.190> I

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
of a rendering thing in Minecraft I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.440 
of a rendering thing in Minecraft I
think<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.950> are<00:02:12.099> in<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.579> glowstone<00:02:13.150> block

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
think if you are in a glowstone block

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.920 
think if you are in a glowstone block
you<00:02:14.200> will<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.590> suffocate<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.269> if<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.599> do<00:02:16.749> this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you will not suffocate so if you do this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.640 
you will not suffocate so if you do this
you<00:02:17.200> will<00:02:17.230> also

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
you will also

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.360 
you will also
suffocate<00:02:18.189> and<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.299> these<00:02:19.540> blocks<00:02:20.159> where<00:02:21.159> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
suffocate and in these blocks where you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.179 
suffocate and in these blocks where you
don't<00:02:21.519> suffocate<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.750> can<00:02:23.019> use<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.500> x-ray

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
don't suffocate you can use this x-ray

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.819 
don't suffocate you can use this x-ray
method<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.909> prime<00:02:25.510> pretty<00:02:25.780> sure<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.200> also<00:02:26.620> works

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
method I prime pretty sure it also works

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.190 
method I prime pretty sure it also works
with<00:02:27.040> TNT<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.360> course<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.840> little<00:02:28.870> bit

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
with TNT but of course it's a little bit

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.619 
with TNT but of course it's a little bit
unsafe<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:30.129> let's<00:02:30.340> write<00:02:30.549> with<00:02:30.819> D&amp;D<00:02:31.150> anyway

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
unsafe but let's write with D&amp;D anyway

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.319 
unsafe but let's write with D&amp;D anyway
just<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.379> show<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.799> works<00:02:33.549> with<00:02:33.760> glowstone

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
just to show you it works with glowstone

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.589 
just to show you it works with glowstone
and<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.769> would<00:02:36.310> work<00:02:36.549> with<00:02:36.760> glass<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.420> can

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
and it would work with glass but you can

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.149 
and it would work with glass but you can
see<00:02:37.780> through<00:02:38.079> glass<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.829> kind<00:02:39.040> of

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
see through glass so it's kind of

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.670 
see through glass so it's kind of
useless<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.420> will<00:02:40.629> not<00:02:40.840> give<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.260> same

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
useless so it will not give you the same

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.920 
useless so it will not give you the same
effect<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.549> these<00:02:43.359> two<00:02:43.599> blocks<00:02:43.870> too<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> we

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
effect as these two blocks too so we

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.059 
effect as these two blocks too so we
just<00:02:47.170> push<00:02:47.439> it<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.939> go<00:02:48.939> inside<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.950> there<00:02:50.950> is

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
just push it on go inside and there is

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.940 
just push it on go inside and there is
still<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.579> this<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.329> gap<00:02:52.629> block<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.230> here<00:02:53.530> under

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
still a this one gap block in here under

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.580 
still a this one gap block in here under
here<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.489> as<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.629> see<00:02:55.870> there<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.349> room

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
here so as you can see there is the room

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.039 
here so as you can see there is the room
began<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.150> some<00:02:58.329> cool<00:02:58.540> stuff<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
began you can see some cool stuff on the

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.020 
began you can see some cool stuff on the
ground<00:02:59.379> it's<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.040> really<00:03:00.280> really<00:03:00.549> easy<00:03:00.790> thing

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
and also let's try to go for 250 likes I

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.050 
and also let's try to go for 250 likes I
think<00:03:35.739> we<00:03:35.829> can<00:03:35.980> do<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.129> we<00:03:36.310> did<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.669> on<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
think we can do that we did it on one of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.149 
think we can do that we did it on one of
the<00:03:37.239> last<00:03:37.389> videos<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.989> I<00:03:38.739> was<00:03:38.859> actually
