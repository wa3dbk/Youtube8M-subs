otherwise<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.790> see<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.150> quite<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.690> nice

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
otherwise you can see it's quite a nice

otherwise you can see it's quite a nice
and<00:03:43.290> bright<00:03:44.630> display<00:03:45.630> not<00:03:45.959> as<00:03:46.110> bright<00:03:46.320> as

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
and bright display not as bright as

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.979 
and bright display not as bright as
maybe<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.250> other<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.700> sony<00:03:48.299> xperia<00:03:48.690> films

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
maybe the other and sony xperia films

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.110 
maybe the other and sony xperia films
which<00:03:49.170> will<00:03:49.380> ever<00:03:49.620> compare<00:03:50.100> compare<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:51.090> to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
which will ever compare compare them to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.500 
which will ever compare compare them to
a<00:03:51.570> right<00:03:52.140> now<00:03:52.350> but<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:53.100> still<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.790> good<00:03:54.060> phone

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
a right now but it's still a good phone

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.180 
a right now but it's still a good phone
so<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.840> take<00:03:55.170> off<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.350> bottom<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.950> this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
so we can take off the bottom like this

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.270 
so we can take off the bottom like this
and<00:03:56.400> actually<00:03:57.150> put<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.930> white<00:03:58.170> bottom<00:03:58.680> quite

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and actually put on a white bottom quite

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.420 
and actually put on a white bottom quite
easily<00:03:59.579> that<00:04:00.000> goes<00:04:00.570> inside<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.350> box<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.799> you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
easily that goes inside the box and you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.340 
easily that goes inside the box and you
can<00:04:02.640> take<00:04:02.850> off<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.060> bag<00:04:03.360> just<00:04:03.600> by<00:04:03.750> sliding<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
can take off the bag just by sliding it

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.520 
can take off the bag just by sliding it
to<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.250> actually

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
to the back actually

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.190 
to the back actually
and<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.970> doesn't<00:04:08.180> want<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> work<00:04:08.900> right<00:04:09.020> now

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
and it doesn't want to work right now

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320 
and it doesn't want to work right now
like<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:10.130> then<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.520> can<00:04:10.760> actually<00:04:11.150> put

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
like this and then you can actually put

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.970 
like this and then you can actually put
in<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.660> battery<00:04:12.020> which<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.319> already<00:04:12.590> said

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
in your battery which I already said

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.610 
in your battery which I already said
what<00:04:13.700> side<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.420> size<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.319> there's<00:04:15.500> a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
what side and size it is and there's a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.409 
what side and size it is and there's a
sim<00:04:15.830> card<00:04:15.860> reader<00:04:16.250> right<00:04:16.430> here<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.910> nothing

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
sim card reader right here and nothing

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.780 
sim card reader right here and nothing
else<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.139> there's<00:04:18.350> no<00:04:18.560> micro<00:04:19.010> sim<00:04:19.220> card<00:04:19.519> slot

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
else so there's no micro sim card slot

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.600 
else so there's no micro sim card slot
which<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.419> too<00:04:20.870> bad<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.440> would<00:04:21.919> be<00:04:22.100> would

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
which is too bad that would be would

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.640 
which is too bad that would be would
have<00:04:22.730> been<00:04:22.910> one<00:04:23.180> nice<00:04:23.540> thing<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:24.230> have<00:04:24.410> with

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
have been one nice thing to have with

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.320 
have been one nice thing to have with
only<00:04:24.830> 8<00:04:25.070> megapixel<00:04:25.730> or<00:04:25.850> eight<00:04:26.090> make<00:04:26.300> a

only 8 megapixel or eight make a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.050 
only 8 megapixel or eight make a
gigabyte<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.200> space<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.520> we<00:04:28.669> have<00:04:28.850> in

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
gigabyte of space so we have in

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.060 
gigabyte of space so we have in

NFC and a little bit different design

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120 
NFC and a little bit different design

then<00:04:44.480> they<00:04:44.630> have<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.900> Sony<00:04:45.140> Xperia<00:04:45.320> P<00:04:46.240> which

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
then they have the Sony Xperia P which

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.020 
then they have the Sony Xperia P which
is<00:04:47.480> actually<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.620> same<00:04:48.830> design<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:49.940> is

is actually the same design and this is

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.430 
is actually the same design and this is
of<00:04:50.060> course<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.390> red<00:04:50.570> version<00:04:50.780> right<00:04:51.020> now<00:04:51.200> it's

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
of course the red version right now it's

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.130 
of course the red version right now it's
made<00:04:51.650> out<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.800> metal<00:04:52.340> case<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:53.570> has<00:04:53.750> all<00:04:53.960> try

NFC and of course a lot bigger display
and<00:04:56.390> there<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.169> actually<00:04:57.560> not<00:04:57.710> much<00:04:57.950> else<00:04:58.130> to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
and there is actually not much else to

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.130 
and there is actually not much else to
say<00:04:58.280> except<00:04:58.700> for<00:04:58.850> 16<00:04:59.240> k<00:04:59.390> white<00:04:59.570> except<00:04:59.840> for<00:05:00.020> a

say except for 16 k white except for a
key<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> white<00:05:00.650> space<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.910> array<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
key a white space and then the array and

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.659 
key a white space and then the array and
you<00:05:03.380> can<00:05:03.560> see<00:05:03.740> it's<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.070> little<00:05:04.370> bit<00:05:04.490> smaller

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
you can see it's a little bit smaller

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.240 
you can see it's a little bit smaller
thinner<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.470> has<00:05:06.740> actually<00:05:07.070> better
