00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
program as you can see there now this is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.510 
program as you can see there now this is
for<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.610> pc<00:01:12.450> i'm<00:01:12.750> sure<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.710> tutorial<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.250> pretty

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
for a pc i'm sure the tutorial is pretty

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
for a pc i'm sure the tutorial is pretty
similar<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> mac<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.930> steps<00:01:16.200> before

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
similar for a mac but the steps before

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
similar for a mac but the steps before
this<00:01:16.920> evasion<00:01:17.580> program<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> open<00:01:18.180> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this evasion program is open it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
this evasion program is open it's
probably<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.650> pc<00:01:20.100> than<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> mac<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
probably more for pc than a mac so for a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.249 
probably more for pc than a mac so for a
mac<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> might<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.750> bit<00:01:21.930> different

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
mac it might be a little bit different

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
mac it might be a little bit different
but<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but not too much so all you have to do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
but not too much so all you have to do
is<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.600> sure<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.869> device<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> plugged<00:01:25.530> in

not<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.000> many<00:01:48.090> steps<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:48.990> except

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
not that many steps for you to do except

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
not that many steps for you to do except
for<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.430> does<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
for this one right here it does the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
for this one right here it does the
program<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.390> ask<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> slide<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> unlock

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
program will ask you to slide to unlock

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
program will ask you to slide to unlock
and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.310> open<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> evasion<00:01:54.270> application

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and then open up the evasion application

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
and then open up the evasion application
as<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.430> need<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
as you can see there so you will need to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.270 
as you can see there so you will need to
do<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.350> device<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.560> restart<00:01:58.890> again<00:01:59.009> your

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
do that device will restart again your

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.730 
do that device will restart again your
device<00:01:59.520> will<00:02:00.329> restart<00:02:00.689> many<00:02:01.020> times<00:02:01.380> during

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
device will restart many times during

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
device will restart many times during
this<00:02:01.920> process<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.090> it's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
this process but as you can see it's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
this process but as you can see it's
just<00:02:04.140> restarting<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.430> probably<00:02:06.119> takes

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
just restarting again it probably takes

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
just restarting again it probably takes
around<00:02:06.450> six<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.899> seven<00:02:07.170> minutes<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
around six to seven minutes with the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
around six to seven minutes with the
amount<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.340> times<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> restarts<00:02:09.179> i<00:02:09.270> cut

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
amount of times that it restarts i cut

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.510 
amount of times that it restarts i cut
through<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.530> those<00:02:10.830> parts<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> can

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
through all of those parts as you can

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.160 
through all of those parts as you can
see<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.000> fades

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
see with all these fades

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.240 
see with all these fades
I'm<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.349> showing<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.709> some<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.069> key

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
I'm just showing you some of the key

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.339 
I'm just showing you some of the key
parts<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> process<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.540> basically

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
parts of the process but basically

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.710 
parts of the process but basically
should<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:17.190> no<00:02:17.340> longer<00:02:17.550> than<00:02:17.700> seven<00:02:18.390> minutes<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
should be no longer than seven minutes I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.020 
should be no longer than seven minutes I
would<00:02:18.870> say<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:20.010> iOS<00:02:20.250> 7<00:02:20.640> device<00:02:20.819> will<00:02:21.000> be

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
would say and your iOS 7 device will be

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.330 
would say and your iOS 7 device will be
fully<00:02:21.390> untethered<00:02:22.020> we'll<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> fully

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
fully untethered we'll have a fully

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.699 
fully untethered we'll have a fully
untethered<00:02:23.790> jailbreak<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.410> program

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
untethered jailbreak so on the program

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.010 
untethered jailbreak so on the program
right<00:02:25.890> now<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.190> does<00:02:26.370> say<00:02:26.550> done<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> i<00:02:27.989> can

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
right now it does say done so i can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.650 
right now it does say done so i can
simply<00:02:28.590> exit<00:02:29.489> out<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.970> program<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
simply exit out of the program and as

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
simply exit out of the program and as
you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.380> idevice<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> is

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
you can see here is my idevice and it is

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.540 
you can see here is my idevice and it is
turning<00:02:32.850> back<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.270> once<00:02:34.050> again<00:02:34.350> with<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> iOS

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
turning back on once again with the iOS

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.870 
turning back on once again with the iOS
7<00:02:35.940> boot<00:02:36.360> logo<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.980> does<00:02:38.220> show<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
7 boot logo and it does show this the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.479 
7 boot logo and it does show this the
evasion<00:02:39.300> logo<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.959> gives<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.260> guys<00:02:40.489> some

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
evasion logo and it gives you guys some

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.430 
evasion logo and it gives you guys some
of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> steps<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.720> finishing<00:02:43.050> up<00:02:43.260> on

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
of the steps that it is finishing up on

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.699 
of the steps that it is finishing up on
your<00:02:43.560> device<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:44.519> jailbreaking<00:02:45.000> iOS<00:02:45.930> 7<00:02:46.530> so

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
your device with jailbreaking iOS 7 so

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.840 
your device with jailbreaking iOS 7 so
as<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:46.980> see<00:02:47.130> there<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.430> says<00:02:47.610> reading

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
as you can see there it says reading

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.340 
as you can see there it says reading
kernel<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:50.209> then<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.360> says<00:02:51.569> calculating

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
kernel and then it says calculating

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.759 
kernel and then it says calculating
offsets<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:54.019> pretty<00:02:55.019> soon<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> very

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
offsets and pretty soon this is the very

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.770 
offsets and pretty soon this is the very
last<00:02:55.920> step<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.459> jailbreaking<00:02:57.000> process<00:02:57.540> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
last step of the jailbreaking process so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840 
last step of the jailbreaking process so
after<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:59.069> jailbreak<00:02:59.489> will<00:02:59.700> be

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
after this the jailbreak will be

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.750 
after this the jailbreak will be
complete<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.450> your<00:03:01.019> iOS<00:03:01.350> 7<00:03:01.799> device<00:03:02.040> will<00:03:02.610> have

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
complete in your iOS 7 device will have

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850 
complete in your iOS 7 device will have
an<00:03:02.910> untethered<00:03:03.330> jailbreak<00:03:03.660> no<00:03:04.380> matter<00:03:04.560> what

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
an untethered jailbreak no matter what
