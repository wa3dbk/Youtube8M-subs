directory all you need to do is select
the<00:04:34.060> main<00:04:34.240> directory<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.370> top<00:04:36.580> folder

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
the main directory just the top folder

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.810 
the main directory just the top folder
of<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.270> USB<00:04:37.510> drivers<00:04:38.070> select<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.370> hit<00:04:39.430> OK
