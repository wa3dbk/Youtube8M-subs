we<00:00:05.100> believe<00:00:05.400> technology<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.480> at<00:00:06.690> its<00:00:06.840> very

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
we believe technology is at its very

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.180 
we believe technology is at its very
best<00:00:07.170> when<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.189> invisible

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
best when it's invisible

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.919

when<00:00:10.759> you're<00:00:10.879> conscious<00:00:11.299> only<00:00:11.420> of<00:00:11.750> what

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
when you're conscious only of what

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.259 
when you're conscious only of what
you're<00:00:12.080> doing<00:00:12.410> not<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.610> device<00:00:13.849> you're<00:00:14.000> doing

you're doing not the device you're doing
it<00:00:14.389> with<00:00:14.539> an<00:00:15.610> iPad<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:16.849> the<00:00:17.270> perfect

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
it with an iPad is the perfect

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.350 
it with an iPad is the perfect
expression<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.230> that<00:00:18.590> idea<00:00:18.939> it's<00:00:19.939> just<00:00:20.060> this

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
expression of that idea it's just this

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.720 
expression of that idea it's just this
magical<00:00:20.900> pane<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.230> glass<00:00:21.340> but<00:00:22.340> can<00:00:22.460> become

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
magical pane of glass but can become

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.470 
magical pane of glass but can become
anything<00:00:23.029> you<00:00:23.270> want<00:00:23.480> it<00:00:23.570> to<00:00:23.660> be<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:25.480> that's

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
anything you want it to be and that's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.810 
anything you want it to be and that's
why<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:26.899> many<00:00:26.960> people<00:00:27.169> in<00:00:27.649> so<00:00:27.739> many<00:00:28.550> different

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
why so many people in so many different

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.269 
why so many people in so many different
places<00:00:29.000> are<00:00:29.629> using<00:00:30.619> it<00:00:30.710> for<00:00:30.950> so<00:00:31.160> many

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
places are using it for so many

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.970 
places are using it for so many
different<00:00:31.489> things<00:00:32.200> it's<00:00:33.200> a<00:00:33.350> more<00:00:33.500> personal

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980

them<00:02:14.580> from<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.910> signals<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.830> major

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
them from the signals it's a major

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.440 
them from the signals it's a major
breakthrough

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
breakthrough

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.780 
breakthrough
and<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> key<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.560> making<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> pixels<00:02:20.550> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and it's the key to making the pixels so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.119 
and it's the key to making the pixels so
small<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.420> close<00:02:21.870> together<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.379> the

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
small and so close together that the

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.430 
small and so close together that the
human<00:02:23.459> eye<00:02:23.550> can't<00:02:23.849> even<00:02:24.000> distinguish<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.629> so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
human eye can't even distinguish them so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.160 
human eye can't even distinguish them so
