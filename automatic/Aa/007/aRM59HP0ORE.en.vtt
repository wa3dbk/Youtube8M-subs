00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
much mine is the shortening but it's

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.090

going<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.869> be<00:01:14.930> super<00:01:15.200> simple<00:01:15.350> now<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
going to be super simple now in the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.190 
going to be super simple now in the
mixer<00:01:16.460> I'm<00:01:16.670> going<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.180> put<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.450> my<00:01:17.479> unsalted

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
mixer I'm going to put in my unsalted

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.399 
mixer I'm going to put in my unsalted
butter<00:01:18.350> it's<00:01:18.890> nice<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.340> soft<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.260> I'm<00:01:21.260> going

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
butter it's nice and soft and I'm going

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.820 
butter it's nice and soft and I'm going
to<00:01:21.470> put<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.770> both<00:01:22.130> kinds<00:01:22.760> of<00:01:22.909> sugar<00:01:23.350> now<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.560> you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
to put in both kinds of sugar now if you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.230 
to put in both kinds of sugar now if you
want<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.580> don't<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:26.000> brown<00:01:26.210> sugar

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
want to if you don't have brown sugar

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.940 
want to if you don't have brown sugar
then<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.439> whole<00:01:27.590> thing<00:01:27.619> with

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
then you can do the whole thing with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.280 
then you can do the whole thing with
regular<00:01:28.280> sugar<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:28.939> suggest<00:01:29.780> looking<00:01:30.020> for

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
regular sugar but I suggest looking for

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.510 
regular sugar but I suggest looking for
the<00:01:30.350> brown<00:01:30.500> sugar<00:01:30.770> because<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.189> gives<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.460> a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the brown sugar because it gives it a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.200 
the brown sugar because it gives it a
little<00:01:31.700> extra<00:01:31.939> sort<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:33.820> molasses<00:01:34.820> eat<00:01:34.970> like

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
little extra sort of molasses eat like

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.330 
little extra sort of molasses eat like
almost<00:01:35.600> like<00:01:35.750> molasses<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.470> there<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:36.920> it's

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
almost like molasses in there so it's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.440 
almost like molasses in there so it's
really<00:01:37.580> good<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:37.880> I'm<00:01:37.970> just<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.270> cream

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
really good so I'm just going to cream

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.260 
really good so I'm just going to cream
this<00:01:38.540> together<00:01:38.689> for<00:01:39.049> about<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.259> minute

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
this together for about a minute

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.120 
this together for about a minute
once<00:01:41.869> your<00:01:42.079> butter<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.350> sugars<00:01:42.770> are<00:01:42.920> well

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
once your butter and sugars are well

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.840 
once your butter and sugars are well
mixed<00:01:43.340> I'm<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.600> add<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:44.899> my<00:01:45.020> eggs<00:01:45.320> and
