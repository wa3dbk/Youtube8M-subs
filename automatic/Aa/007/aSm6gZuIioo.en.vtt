flash drive is actually the red one
there<00:00:17.390> you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.109> loop<00:00:19.470> there<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.830> can

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
there you can see the loop there we can

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.960 
there you can see the loop there we can
connect<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:21.359> keyring<00:00:22.050> adapter<00:00:22.970> also

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

it comes with just a standard blue brick

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.259 
it comes with just a standard blue brick
as<00:00:25.890> well<00:00:27.769> turning<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> over<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> rear<00:00:29.580> we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
as well turning it over to the rear we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
as well turning it over to the rear we
find<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.869> information<00:00:31.309> we<00:00:32.309> could<00:00:32.489> see

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
find some more information we could see

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.830 
find some more information we could see
that<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> USB<00:00:33.809> 2.0<00:00:34.649> Drive<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.690> this<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that it is a USB 2.0 Drive and this is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.280 
that it is a USB 2.0 Drive and this is
actually<00:00:37.290> made<00:00:37.500> by<00:00:37.530> PNY<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.790> licensed<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.050> use

actually made by PNY and licensed to use

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.150 
actually made by PNY and licensed to use
the<00:00:40.559> Lego<00:00:41.520> logo<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> brick<00:00:42.989> styling<00:00:43.500> also<00:00:43.739> we

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the Lego logo and brick styling also we

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
the Lego logo and brick styling also we
can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.120> assembled<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> USA

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
can see that it is assembled in the USA

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
can see that it is assembled in the USA
so<00:00:46.980> let's<00:00:47.160> open<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> closer

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so let's open this up and have a closer

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.459 
so let's open this up and have a closer
look<00:00:52.879> first<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
look first up here we can see the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 
look first up here we can see the
keyring<00:00:56.280> adapter<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.899> obviously<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
keyring adapter here so obviously we can

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.420 
keyring adapter here so obviously we can
just<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:58.920> through<00:00:59.129> onto<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> memory<00:01:00.090> stick

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
just look through onto the memory stick

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.060 
just look through onto the memory stick
secondly<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> standard<00:01:03.660> LEGO

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
secondly we just get a standard LEGO

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
secondly we just get a standard LEGO
brick<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:07.790> then<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> main<00:01:09.090> device<00:01:09.390> itself

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
brick and then the main device itself

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.030 
brick and then the main device itself
here<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.130> memory<00:01:11.490> stick<00:01:13.040> designed

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
here we have the memory stick designed

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
here we have the memory stick designed
to<00:01:14.220> look<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.369> three<00:01:14.970> plates<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.810> top<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
to look like three plates one on top of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.170 
to look like three plates one on top of
the<00:01:16.140> other<00:01:17.479> here<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> loop<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
the other here we can see the loop there

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
the other here we can see the loop there
where<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.780> keyring<00:01:22.259> adapter<00:01:22.680> on

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
where we can it be keyring adapter on

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.600 
where we can it be keyring adapter on
the<00:01:23.509> top<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.140> standard<00:01:25.710> Lego<00:01:26.220> stud

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the top we have the standard Lego stud

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.530 
the top we have the standard Lego stud
design<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.520> underneath<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.270> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
design and then underneath we have this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.609 
design and then underneath we have this
slider<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.520> which<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.880> slide<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:36.619> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
slider here which we just slide up to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
slider here which we just slide up to
reveal<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.210> USB<00:01:39.210> connectors<00:01:39.720> there

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.749 

and<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:47.600> push<00:01:48.600> back<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.200> put<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> away

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
and then just push back to put it away

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.010 
and then just push back to put it away
and<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.159> clip

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
and as you can see this will just clip

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
and as you can see this will just clip
onto<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> standard<00:01:55.439> LEGO<00:01:55.619> brick<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> Lego

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
onto a standard LEGO brick or a Lego

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
onto a standard LEGO brick or a Lego
brick<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> will<00:01:57.810> clip<00:01:58.049> onto<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> top<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:01.289> if

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
brick it will clip onto the top so if

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
brick it will clip onto the top so if
you<00:02:01.770> wish<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.580> important

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you wish to put some important

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.139 
you wish to put some important
information<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.939> could<00:02:06.119> actually

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
information on here you could actually

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.029 
information on here you could actually
incorporate<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.710> Lego

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
incorporate it into one of your Lego

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
incorporate it into one of your Lego
builds<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.729> wish<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.599> hide<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
builds if you wish to do so and hide it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.180 
builds if you wish to do so and hide it
away<00:02:12.019> okay<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.080> let's<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.890> thing

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
away okay so let's get this thing

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.720 
away okay so let's get this thing
plugged<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> speed<00:02:15.599> test<00:02:16.670> okay<00:02:17.670> so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
plugged in and do a speed test okay so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460 
plugged in and do a speed test okay so
the<00:02:18.060> speed<00:02:18.360> test<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.019> doing<00:02:19.200> is

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the speed test I'm going to be doing is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.400 
the speed test I'm going to be doing is
on<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.220> Mac<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.760> first<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.299> all<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.690> will<00:02:22.260> load

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
on the Mac so first of all I will load

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.520 
on the Mac so first of all I will load
up<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> Disk<00:02:22.920> Utility<00:02:24.049> here<00:02:25.049> we<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
up the Disk Utility here we can see the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
up the Disk Utility here we can see the
drive<00:02:25.739> has<00:02:25.980> been<00:02:26.190> detected<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.090> just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
drive has been detected so I'm just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.270 
drive has been detected so I'm just
going<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.360> double<00:02:27.540> check<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
going to double check that it is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to double check that it is
selected<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.870> disk<00:02:31.349> format

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
selected to be on the right disk format

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.460 
selected to be on the right disk format
yes<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.440> says

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
yes and as we can see here it says

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.880 
yes and as we can see here it says
ms-dos<00:02:35.280> fat32<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.170> universally

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
ms-dos fat32 so it's universally

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.620 
ms-dos fat32 so it's universally
detectable<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:39.239> platforms<00:02:41.150> okay<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.209> here

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
detectable on all platforms okay so here

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
detectable on all platforms okay so here
we<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:43.110> disk<00:02:43.530> speed<00:02:44.069> test<00:02:44.130> from

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
we are with disk speed test from

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.990 
we are with disk speed test from
Blackmagic<00:02:45.180> Design<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.680> Lego<00:02:47.519> USB

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
but just take into account that it is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.660 
but just take into account that it is
only<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:54.030> USB<00:02:54.810> 2.0<00:02:55.650> device<00:02:58.280> okay<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.340> we<00:02:59.519> go<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
only a USB 2.0 device okay so we go to
