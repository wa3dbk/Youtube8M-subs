00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 hello everyone guys are widely smn 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.230
 we are here today to sketch this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 what is this is one of the three monitors that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 I bought myself and it is exactly the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.710
 well more than 460 lbs so let's not lose 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.710
 time and we start to damage the box 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 ok what we find inside the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:54.020
 box as first thing we find the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:59.280
 display stand ok 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 subsequently we find the part immediately 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.939
 which goes higher than the crystal where it will be 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.749
 hooked opposite then these two 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.829
 they will be so ok and they are naturally with 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.829
 over the protective plastic 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:21.929
 we are going to remove polystyrene and 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.950
 inside we find a cable of 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.200
 supply 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 ok i have taken in spain unfortunately not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.289
 I know why I don't know if in Spain 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.079
 have this hold but it has arrived 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.570
 so thank goodness lots of dogs from 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.659
 there 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.820
 It takes home less I like about you 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.720
 we are going to scream a lot that already has 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:56.470
 connected the Virgilian cable I will go to 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:02:00.190
 remove this is the monitor mounted 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.840
 as you can see very high ok very much 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.460
 I have to say I am perfectly comfortable 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.170
 on the desk this is not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 of course they have a desk but mine 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.600
 beautiful table in the kitchen 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.709
 now let's go and see all of his 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.730
 features 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:19.080
 in the specific one then this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.040
 monitor here a size of 24 inches 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:28.000
 format of 16 9 and resolution 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 maximum of 1980 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 the contrast is 1000 contrast 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.130
 native excuse me and a thousand to 1 instead 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 dynamic contrast and 12 million to 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.269
 1 the response of this monitor is 2 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.940
 milliseconds and of course not necessary 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.500
 forget that this is a red mount 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.780
 and it is not an LCD 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.320
 let's see the connectors that a 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.269
 this monitor ok 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.690
 as you can see the back of the monitor 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:07.280
 it's very nice and kind of like it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.800
 it was carbon as a material 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.520
 an effect they created if we go to 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.410
 see below the only one at the moment 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.360
 little flaw of this monitor like 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.060
 you can see is the lack of 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.410
 an hdmi entry 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.610
 but since I didn't care about ho 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.950
 no kind of problem because me 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.260
 I will stick all the monitors I have here in 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.690
 all four through the of wight 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 that this attack is white because not 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.400
 he knew it was the blue attack of course 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.540
 to the lie attack 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.209
 subsequently from the opposite side of the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.700
 monitor we can find the attack of 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.730
 power supply and sideways behind 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.720
 all rates if that will be used for 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.840
 being able to set up our monitor one 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.120
 important feature in my opinion is 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.519
 which contains 17 languages ​​included 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.550
 Italian so we won't have any 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.290
 problem if you don't always know English 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.350
 or any other language in setting 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.989
 this monitor ultimately this is 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.340
 a very good monitor is also a cost 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.560
 very content because I paid 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.070
 roughly 130 euros his hand 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.109
 Spanish so I hope this video 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.180
 you enjoyed it if you have any questions 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.229
 to let me subscribe apple in the comments here 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.840
 under 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.590
 put a nice like and share the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.979
 video if you can 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.190
 and of course expect a video 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.530
 next maybe not right away but squeeze 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.450
 the next two weeks in which there is 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.190
 they show a little in 1 set up because I have 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.350
 also naturally mounted a note that 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.510
 mania since the previous one was 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.090
 small to hold three monitors 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.740
 plus the upper quarter so hi a 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.740
 all boys and the next episode
