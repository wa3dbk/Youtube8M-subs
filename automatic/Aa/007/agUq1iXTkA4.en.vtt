would<00:01:09.030> usually<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.990> sport<00:01:10.350> courts

your plastic on concrete anything above

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760 
your plastic on concrete anything above
that<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.780> artistic<00:01:22.140> skating

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that would be for your artistic skating

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
that would be for your artistic skating
or<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.400> slide<00:01:23.610> skating<00:01:24.080> now<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
or your slide skating now you want that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
or your slide skating now you want that
number<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.400> high<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.909> possibly<00:01:27.330> can

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
number to be as high as you possibly can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
number to be as high as you possibly can
before<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.650> starts<00:01:28.979> becoming<00:01:29.280> an<00:01:29.490> issue<00:01:29.640> with

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
before it starts becoming an issue with

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
before it starts becoming an issue with
slippage<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> real<00:01:30.990> rough<00:01:31.229> ride<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.159> reason

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
slippage or a real rough ride the reason

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
slippage or a real rough ride the reason
being<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> softer<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> wheel<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.229> slower

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
being is the softer the wheel is slower

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.100 
being is the softer the wheel is slower
it<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.390> work<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it is so with a more work it's going to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
it is so with a more work it's going to
take<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> speed<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> maintain

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
take to get up to speed and maintain

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.929 
take to get up to speed and maintain
that<00:01:39.210> speed<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.229> I've<00:01:40.650> said<00:01:40.890> before<00:01:40.950> with

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that speed and as I've said before with

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
that speed and as I've said before with
Derby<00:01:42.240> many<00:01:42.990> games<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.530> won<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.740> lost<00:01:43.890> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Derby many games are won and lost on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
Derby many games are won and lost on
fatigue<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.420> want<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> number<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.110> as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
fatigue so you want that number to be as

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
fatigue so you want that number to be as
high<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> possibly<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:48.149> wave

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
high as you possibly can and your wave

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
high as you possibly can and your wave
is<00:01:48.540> also<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.899> factor<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> heavier<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
is also a factor the heavier you are the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
is also a factor the heavier you are the
higher<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.180> number<00:01:51.240> should<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.899> well

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
higher that number should be as well

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
higher that number should be as well
because<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> urethane<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.579> begin<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because the urethane will begin to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
because the urethane will begin to
compress<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.530> urethane<00:01:56.070> on

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
compress and you get more urethane on

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.789 
compress and you get more urethane on
the<00:01:56.790> ground<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.990> also<00:01:58.320> slows<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.770> down

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the ground and that also slows you down
