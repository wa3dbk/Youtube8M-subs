to<00:02:53.690> play<00:02:55.540> for<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.600> most<00:02:56.780> part<00:02:56.960> we<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.400> go

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
to play for the most part we have to go

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.830 
to play for the most part we have to go
out<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.700> forget<00:02:58.940> about<00:02:59.000> there<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.540> he's<00:02:59.660> not

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
out and forget about there and he's not

here<00:03:00.110> we<00:03:00.470> always<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.950> forget<00:03:01.220> about<00:03:01.280> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
here we always have to forget about it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.430 
but the idea is when you go play you
can't<00:03:03.380> worry<00:03:03.590> about<00:03:04.390> that's<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.630> sweetens
