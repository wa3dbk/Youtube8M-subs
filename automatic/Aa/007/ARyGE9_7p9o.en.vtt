with c100 here at the show we're

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.330 
with c100 here at the show we're
actually<00:00:13.410> demonstrating<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.099> first

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
actually demonstrating for the first

actually demonstrating for the first
time<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.330> dual<00:00:15.690> pixel<00:00:15.960> CMOS<00:00:16.410> AF<00:00:16.650> which<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
time the dual pixel CMOS AF which is a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
time the dual pixel CMOS AF which is a
feature<00:00:17.550> upgrade<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.210> currently

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
feature upgrade that's currently

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.870 
feature upgrade that's currently
available<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.470> camera<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.400> by<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.670> way

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
available for that camera and by the way

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
available for that camera and by the way
it's<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.420> available<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> c300

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
it's going to be available for the c300

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.580 
it's going to be available for the c300
as<00:00:23.039> well<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.789> later<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.170> now<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
as well little bit later on now this is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.700 
as well little bit later on now this is
a<00:00:25.619> feature<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:27.140> takes<00:00:28.140> advantage<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
a feature that really takes advantage of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
a feature that really takes advantage of
the<00:00:28.830> fact<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.519> actual<00:00:29.970> image<00:00:30.240> sensor<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the fact that the actual image sensor in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
the fact that the actual image sensor in
this<00:00:30.900> camera<00:00:31.230> has<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> same<00:00:32.340> basic

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
this camera has got the same basic

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
this camera has got the same basic
architecture<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> 70d

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
architecture as the one in the 70d

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
architecture as the one in the 70d
meaning<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.550> each<00:00:36.059> individual<00:00:36.630> pixel<00:00:36.870> has

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
meaning that each individual pixel has

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920 
meaning that each individual pixel has
split<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:38.100> photo<00:00:38.340> diodes<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> because

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
split into two photo diodes and because

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
split into two photo diodes and because
of<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> design<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.829> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.460> focused

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
of that design we're able to do focused

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
of that design we're able to do focused
measurement<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> imaging<00:00:43.170> simultaneously

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
measurement and imaging simultaneously

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.580 
measurement and imaging simultaneously
it's<00:00:44.700> unique<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> industry<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's unique in the industry to have that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's unique in the industry to have that
capability<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.420> able<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
capability and what we're able to do in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.600 
capability and what we're able to do in
terms<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.410> autofocus<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.219> camera<00:00:50.430> is

most effectively is is supported by
another<00:01:23.640> feature<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.240> call<00:01:24.390> AF<00:01:24.720> block<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
another feature we call AF block and so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
another feature we call AF block and so
you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.939> program<00:01:27.299> any<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> assignable

to be just start off in AF lock mode be

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
to be just start off in AF lock mode be
able<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> aim<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> camera<00:01:39.840> where

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
able to kind of aim the camera where

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
able to kind of aim the camera where
they<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.310> compose<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> shot

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
they want to actually compose the shot

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.120 
they want to actually compose the shot
and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.170> ready<00:01:43.200> let<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and then when they're ready let go of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
and then when they're ready let go of
that<00:01:44.250> button<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> focus<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.780> comes

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that button so that the focus then comes

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
that button so that the focus then comes
in<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.460> instead<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> camera<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
in so that instead of the camera just

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
in so that instead of the camera just
randomly<00:01:49.320> focusing<00:01:50.070> wherever<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> pointed

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
randomly focusing wherever is pointed

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
randomly focusing wherever is pointed
that<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> operator<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:53.040> control<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that you as the operator of control you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
that you as the operator of control you
know<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> focus<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
know where that focus is going to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.970 
know where that focus is going to
operate<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> win

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
operate and win

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.070 
operate and win
so<00:01:57.370> it's<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.030> very<00:01:58.270> very<00:01:58.480> powerful<00:01:58.720> feature

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
so it's a very very powerful feature

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.110 
so it's a very very powerful feature
that<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.980> really<00:02:00.130> save<00:02:00.460> your<00:02:00.640> butt<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.030> it's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
that can really save your butt and it's

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.240 
that can really save your butt and it's
a<00:02:01.270> lot<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.540> situations<00:02:02.110> because<00:02:02.410> when<00:02:03.130> you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
a lot of situations because when you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.040 
a lot of situations because when you
have<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> c100<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.180> got<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.330> large<00:02:04.570> chip<00:02:04.900> you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
have a c100 you got a large chip you

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.360 
have a c100 you got a large chip you
have<00:02:05.080> shallow<00:02:05.440> depth-of-field<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.280> if

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
have shallow depth-of-field and if

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.010 
have shallow depth-of-field and if
you're<00:02:06.520> walking<00:02:06.820> around<00:02:07.270> or<00:02:07.420> your<00:02:07.570> subject<00:02:07.930> is

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
you're walking around or your subject is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.570 
you're walking around or your subject is
moving<00:02:08.440> it's<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.680> little<00:02:08.890> bit<00:02:08.979> tough<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.399> keep

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
moving it's a little bit tough to keep

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730 
moving it's a little bit tough to keep
focused<00:02:10.060> but<00:02:10.420> with<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.720> feature<00:02:10.960> as<00:02:11.320> long<00:02:11.560> as

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
focused but with this feature as long as

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.350 
focused but with this feature as long as
they're<00:02:11.980> framed<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> center<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.240> you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
they're framed up in the center that you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780 
they're framed up in the center that you
can<00:02:13.540> do<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.780> very<00:02:13.930> quickly<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.580> no

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
can do that very quickly there is no

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.310 
can do that very quickly there is no
change<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> sensor<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.750> all<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.140> they

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
change in the sensor at all all they

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.110 
change in the sensor at all all they
really<00:02:17.440> did<00:02:17.740> was<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.100> turn<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.700> function

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
really did was to turn on the function

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120 
really did was to turn on the function
and<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:19.810> what<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
and then what they have to do in the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.310 
and then what they have to do in the
service<00:02:21.340> center<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.690> able<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.080> calibrate

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
service center is be able to calibrate

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.310 
service center is be able to calibrate
each<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> individual<00:02:25.330> pixels<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.290> that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
each of the individual pixels so that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.040 
each of the individual pixels so that
the<00:02:26.560> focusing<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.100> consistent<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.959> other

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
the focusing is consistent so in other

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.080 
the focusing is consistent so in other
words<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.590> capability<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.790> from<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
words the capability was there from the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.810 
words the capability was there from the
get-go<00:02:31.300> it's<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.380> question<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:33.070> they've

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
get-go it's just a question that they've

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.330 
get-go it's just a question that they've
now<00:02:33.970> been<00:02:34.180> able<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.420> activate<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.050> now<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
now been able to activate it now the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.560 
now been able to activate it now the
other<00:02:36.490> question<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:36.850> people<00:02:37.150> are<00:02:37.360> going<00:02:37.480> to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
other question that people are going to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.270 
other question that people are going to
ask<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.900> what<00:02:38.110> about<00:02:38.200> other<00:02:38.470> cameras<00:02:38.890> right

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
ask is what about other cameras right

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.510 
ask is what about other cameras right
and<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.750> turns<00:02:40.930> out<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
and so as it turns out that with the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.180 
and so as it turns out that with the
exception<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> CSeries<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.590> 70d

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
exception of the CSeries and the 70d

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.850 
exception of the CSeries and the 70d
none<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.270> other<00:02:46.420> Rios<00:02:46.780> models<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
none of the other Rios models have that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.460 
none of the other Rios models have that
architecture<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> sensor<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.750> there<00:02:50.260> is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
architecture on the sensor so there is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.720 
architecture on the sensor so there is
no<00:02:50.740> possibility<00:02:51.280> at<00:02:51.700> all<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.870> 5d<00:02:53.770> 3<00:02:54.100> or<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> 60

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
no possibility at all of a 5d 3 or a 60

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.550 
no possibility at all of a 5d 3 or a 60
or<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> 70<00:02:55.420> being<00:02:55.630> upgraded<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.200> dual<00:02:56.350> pixel

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
or a 70 being upgraded to dual pixel

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.980 
or a 70 being upgraded to dual pixel
because<00:02:57.459> their<00:02:57.880> sensors<00:02:58.300> are<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.780> way

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
because their sensors are not that way

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.680 
because their sensors are not that way
you're<00:02:59.380> never<00:02:59.560> going<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.770> get<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.070> but<00:03:00.850> as<00:03:01.420> we

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
you're never going to get it but as we

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.540 
you're never going to get it but as we
start<00:03:02.019> moving<00:03:02.080> forward<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.070> our<00:03:03.160> future

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
start moving forward in our future

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.880 
start moving forward in our future
models<00:03:03.970> we're<00:03:04.540> looking<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.989> expand<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
models we're looking to expand the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.160 
models we're looking to expand the
capabilities<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.610> also<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.720> range<00:03:07.959> of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
capabilities and also the range of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.620 
capabilities and also the range of
models<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.620> support<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.310> feature<00:03:09.700> in

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
models that support that feature in

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.870 
models that support that feature in
terms<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.250> applications<00:03:12.250> really<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> only

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
terms of applications really the only

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.190 
terms of applications really the only
thing<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.090> got<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.330> think<00:03:13.570> about<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.959> whether

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
thing you got to think about is whether

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.080 
thing you got to think about is whether
it's<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> camera<00:03:15.010> moving<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.730> subject

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
it's the camera moving or is the subject

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.810 
it's the camera moving or is the subject
moving<00:03:16.390> or<00:03:16.570> both<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.080> if<00:03:17.530> any<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.310> those<00:03:18.459> three

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
moving or both and if any of those three

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.300 
moving or both and if any of those three
situations<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.840> true<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.800> autofocus

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
situations is true then this autofocus
