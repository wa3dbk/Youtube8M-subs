00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
much similar in design aspects as far as

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
much similar in design aspects as far as
what<00:00:23.250> they<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.579> handle<00:00:24.170> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.650> water

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830

all you have to do is remove a few

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.389 
all you have to do is remove a few
screws<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.979> piece<00:01:08.250> right

screws and this and this piece right
here<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.899> actually<00:01:10.049> supports<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
here which is what actually supports the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.060 
here which is what actually supports the
hard<00:01:11.610> drive<00:01:11.909> trays<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.690> in<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.200> will

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
quarter inch bays with adaptors then

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.590 
quarter inch bays with adaptors then
removing<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.149> radiators<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
removing this for the radiators that you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450 
removing this for the radiators that you
can<00:01:39.750> install<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.409> definitely<00:01:40.860> worth<00:01:41.039> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
can install it's definitely worth it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.389 
can install it's definitely worth it
now<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.440> spot<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.039> can<00:01:44.190> mount<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
now the other spot that you can mount a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.680 
now the other spot that you can mount a
radiator<00:01:44.819> is<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:47.270> 120<00:01:48.270> millimeter

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
modification is going to be like a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
modification is going to be like a
Corsair<00:01:58.530> age<00:01:58.709> 50<00:01:59.190> or<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.520> coolant<00:02:00.330> system<00:02:00.780> where

they have the 120 millimeter fan single
radiator<00:02:05.459> mount<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.690> goes<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.140> in

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
radiator mount that just goes right in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.410 
radiator mount that just goes right in
there

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
there

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.920 
there
also<00:02:09.229> what<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.979> could<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.690> which<00:02:11.690> will

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
also what you could do which will

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
also what you could do which will
require<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.740> bit<00:02:12.920> more<00:02:13.190> work<00:02:13.490> but<00:02:13.520> you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
require a little bit more work but you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.670 
require a little bit more work but you
can<00:02:14.360> add<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:16.750> adapter<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.560> then

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
can add a adapter on the back and then

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.960 
can add a adapter on the back and then
like<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> two<00:02:19.460> x<00:02:19.730> 120<00:02:20.390> millimeter<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.970> three

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
like a two x 120 millimeter or three

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.270 
like a two x 120 millimeter or three

rubber grommet holes here that you can

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.080 
rubber grommet holes here that you can

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
you want to go to the extreme side and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.320 
you want to go to the extreme side and
you<00:02:40.370> want<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.670> get<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.820> little<00:02:41.060> more

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
you want to get a little more

you want to get a little more
experimental<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.500> I've<00:02:43.400> had<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> idea

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
experimental with it I've had the idea

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.300 
experimental with it I've had the idea
of<00:02:44.690> mounting<00:02:45.340> either<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.790> 360<00:02:47.660> or<00:02:47.900> 480<00:02:48.620> radiator

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
of mounting either a 360 or 480 radiator

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.240 
of mounting either a 360 or 480 radiator
in<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.360> top<00:02:50.870> here<00:02:51.200> now<00:02:51.590> you're<00:02:51.800> gonna<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.100> to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
in the top here now you're gonna have to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.570 
in the top here now you're gonna have to
remove<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.850> mesh<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:55.310> mesh

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
remove the mesh because the mesh

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.790 
remove the mesh because the mesh
basically<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:56.900> completely<00:02:57.650> in

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
basically is going to be completely in

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550 
basically is going to be completely in
the<00:02:57.920> way<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:59.210> if<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.420> remove<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.900> mesh<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
the way but if you remove this mesh and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.520 
the way but if you remove this mesh and
you<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:01.010> yourself<00:03:01.430> some<00:03:01.840> nice<00:03:02.840> thick<00:03:03.200> fans

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
you have yourself some nice thick fans

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.130 
you have yourself some nice thick fans
and<00:03:04.040> some<00:03:04.700> shrouds<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.510> radiator<00:03:05.990> will

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
and some shrouds the radiator will

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.380 
and some shrouds the radiator will
easily<00:03:06.380> clear<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.700> can<00:03:07.880> either<00:03:08.030> run

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
easily clear this and you can either run

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.930 
easily clear this and you can either run
if<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.750> run<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.960> 360<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.800> could<00:03:09.950> run<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.310> either

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
if you run a 360 you could run it either

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.320 
if you run a 360 you could run it either
you<00:03:11.900> know<00:03:11.930> one<00:03:12.739> two<00:03:13.100> three<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.180> would

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
you know one two three and you would

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.140 
you know one two three and you would
lose<00:03:14.510> your<00:03:14.770> area<00:03:15.770> right<00:03:15.950> here<00:03:16.370> or<00:03:16.730> depending

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
lose your area right here or depending

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.670 
lose your area right here or depending
on<00:03:17.239> how<00:03:17.360> high

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
on how high

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.979 
on how high
or<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.730> could<00:03:18.879> do<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.150> what<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.390> was<00:03:19.629> thinking

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
or you could do like what I was thinking

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.350 
or you could do like what I was thinking
of<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.349> do<00:03:20.439> it<00:03:20.560> 1<00:03:20.799> 2<00:03:21.069> 3<00:03:21.400> or<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:21.909> would<00:03:22.030> hang<00:03:22.209> off

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
of and do it 1 2 3 or it would hang off

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.390 
of and do it 1 2 3 or it would hang off
the<00:03:22.540> back<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:23.110> then<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.799> could<00:03:24.099> just<00:03:24.280> run

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
the back and then you could just run

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.130 
the back and then you could just run
your<00:03:24.549> tubes<00:03:24.819> back<00:03:25.120> through<00:03:25.480> with<00:03:25.629> some<00:03:25.810> 90

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
your tubes back through with some 90

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
your tubes back through with some 90
degree<00:03:26.379> or<00:03:26.409> 45<00:03:26.590> degree<00:03:27.250> fittings<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:28.299> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
degree or 45 degree fittings do the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.470 
degree or 45 degree fittings do the
factory<00:03:28.840> rubber<00:03:29.049> grounded<00:03:29.560> holes<00:03:30.329> now<00:03:31.329> if<00:03:31.390> you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
factory rubber grounded holes now if you

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.270 
factory rubber grounded holes now if you
get<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:31.659> 480<00:03:32.049> rate<00:03:32.379> either<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:32.829> best<00:03:33.069> bet

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
get a 480 rate either your best bet

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.479 
get a 480 rate either your best bet
would<00:03:33.640> be<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.879> do<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.689> two<00:03:35.230> Center<00:03:35.650> fans<00:03:35.920> here

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
would be to do the two Center fans here

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.270 
would be to do the two Center fans here
I<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:37.989> done<00:03:38.230> any<00:03:38.409> measurement<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.099> this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
I have not done any measurement on this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.970 
I have not done any measurement on this
so<00:03:39.519> I'm<00:03:39.609> not<00:03:39.790> fully<00:03:40.060> sure<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:41.200> if<00:03:41.379> this<00:03:41.620> would

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
so I'm not fully sure and if this would

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.119 
so I'm not fully sure and if this would
work<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:42.670> I'm<00:03:43.090> going<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.480> do<00:03:43.629> some<00:03:43.900> some<00:03:44.799> test

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
work but I'm going to do some some test

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.309 
work but I'm going to do some some test

hang one off the back I'm sure there's a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.240 
hang one off the back I'm sure there's a
way<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:16.959> could<00:04:17.229> even<00:04:17.380> mod<00:04:17.650> one<00:04:17.949> that
