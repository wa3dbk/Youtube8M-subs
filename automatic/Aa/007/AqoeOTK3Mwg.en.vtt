00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
texture on it but more importantly I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.590 
texture on it but more importantly I
really<00:02:26.160> do<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.640> how<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.850> tapers<00:02:27.180> at<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
end like that so it starts off thick but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.100 
end like that so it starts off thick but
then<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> goes<00:02:30.090> narrow<00:02:30.450> narrow<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.050> bottom

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.930 
okay the case is 44 millimeters across
and<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:50.070> thickness<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:51.020> 14<00:03:52.020> millimeters<00:03:52.560> now

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
and the thickness is 14 millimeters now

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.920 
and the thickness is 14 millimeters now
the<00:03:53.940> weight<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> don't<00:03:54.330> know<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> weight<00:03:54.750> but

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the weight I don't know the weight but

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.520 
the weight I don't know the weight but
it<00:03:55.020> is<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.290> pretty<00:03:55.560> heavy<00:03:55.770> watch<00:03:56.450> now<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:58.380> is

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it is a pretty heavy watch now this is

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.140 
it is a pretty heavy watch now this is
an<00:03:58.650> automatic<00:03:59.160> watch<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.640> here<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.030> go

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
an automatic watch so here you go

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360 
an automatic watch so here you go
there's<00:04:00.390> just<00:04:00.630> flip<00:04:01.590> upside<00:04:01.920> down<00:04:01.950> show<00:04:02.280> you

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
there's just flip upside down show you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
reserve power of 14 hours on this

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.390 
reserve power of 14 hours on this
movement<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:12.989> pretty<00:04:13.200> good<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:14.160> you
