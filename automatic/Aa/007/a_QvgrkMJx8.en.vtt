00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
exquisite scientific scrutiny to make

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.530 
exquisite scientific scrutiny to make
certain<00:01:22.520> that<00:01:22.550> what<00:01:22.850> came<00:01:23.060> out<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.390> was

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
certain that what came out of it was

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.790 
certain that what came out of it was
something<00:01:23.870> that<00:01:23.900> was<00:01:24.110> really<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.620> truly

something that was really and truly

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.190 
something that was really and truly
going<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.250> be<00:01:25.400> valuable<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:26.660> we<00:01:26.870> think<00:01:27.080> that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
going to be valuable so we think that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020 
going to be valuable so we think that
this<00:01:27.470> project<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.100> really<00:01:28.310> totally<00:01:28.940> in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
this project is really totally in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.460 
this project is really totally in
alignment<00:01:29.300> with<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.570> core<00:01:29.870> principles<00:01:30.380> of

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470

Ayurveda<00:01:30.920> which<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.760> let<00:01:31.940> something

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
Ayurveda which is to let something

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.510 
Ayurveda which is to let something

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
evolved to a new level in many ways I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.770 
evolved to a new level in many ways I
think<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:34.970> Chopra<00:01:35.300> Center<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.750> a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
think of the Chopra Center is a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.740 
think of the Chopra Center is a
spiritual<00:01:36.530> intensive<00:01:37.070> care<00:01:37.310> unit<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.850> that

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
spiritual intensive care unit and that

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.690 
spiritual intensive care unit and that
when<00:01:39.020> people<00:01:39.260> are<00:01:39.350> going<00:01:39.530> through
