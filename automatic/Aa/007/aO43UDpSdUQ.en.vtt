00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hey people and welcome to this 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.549
 small video of a different kind 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.030
 I had the opportunity today the lg 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.800
 to test flex 2 in more detail and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.960
 my first impressions after a day 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:21.240
 the detailed use the experience 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 her after the intro a lot of fun when I am 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.689
 a smartphone for the first time in the hand 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 I suppose first of all 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 of course the size up 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 and despite the relatively large size 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 display size of 55 inches is that the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.340
 flex two relatively small in itself 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.739
 compared to a 6 plus with the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 same display size is in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.190
 reality already much smaller 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 if it is not so in this recording 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.309
 crass fails 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.989
 but the difference is already very 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.000
 clearly what I liked very well 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 is just the fact that it is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 bent is what he gets that too 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.930
 and it's just so nice 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 to have a bent device be it if you 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 scrolls through his twitter timeline 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 or whatever it is to use it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 just so much futuristic and it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.229
 just makes a lot more fun i think 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 it definitely does not suit everyone 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.880
 smartphone at ios devices could do it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 I think something funny and unfamiliar 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 look but fits this kid's child 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.330
 it just kind of pretty much it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 good is too overweight and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 offers useful function 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700
 That's why I could not do anything there 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.159
 Negative but negative 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 was the battery and you could notice 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.220
 can tell me what you want that is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 and remains the most important one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 smartphone because I bring my own 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 you have a good camera and good software 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
 good performance if the whole after 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.790
 Two to three hours are no longer running 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.950
 now one or the other likes it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.689
 Maybe you think that will happen 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 also did not test so long 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 but if the team flags after one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.829
 footpath of 20 minutes from 90 to 80 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 percent battery capacity is falling already 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.250
 a clear sign because I mean 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 if you use his smartphone i and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.820
 it loses 10% battery capacity then it is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.159
 It's already too much in my eyes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 and the tlg genuine better battery 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.060
 I only have to install a camera 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.590
 say that she convinced me 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.329
 you do not get an iphone 6 here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 plus or note 4 level but you get 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.320
 a really fast autofocus im 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.869
 big and beautiful pictures is good 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 okay and I mean what more could you want 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 the buttons on the back I found 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.660
 personally quite intuitive and 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 sixth rich I did not know it before 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.890
 and performance-wise what actually 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.470
 also completely alright what me 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.450
 it is noticeable that sometimes 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.890
 without reason has extremely long loading times 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.990
 Hopefully with a software 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 update change but otherwise i can 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.350
 you recommend that the flex 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.270
 although there the battery really a bit 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.830
 in the way is in your place I would 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.510
 just wait for the follower and 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.640
 hope that this one better battery 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.370
 so these were my impressions 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.220
 from the lg flex 2 after one day 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 i hope this other voice over a too 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.140
 commented a bit live 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.000
 like 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.140
 if it should be something I would be 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.630
 about your feedback in the comments 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.760
 happy and then I would say with us 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.600
 Hopefully the next video up 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.600
 look there
