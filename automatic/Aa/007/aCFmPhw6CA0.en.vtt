raining if it's slippery outside you can

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.850 
raining if it's slippery outside you can
always<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.330> other<00:02:45.960> advantage<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.710> if

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
always do it the other advantage is if

outdoors it's very very tough to go
jogging<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.310> other<00:03:53.490> disadvantage<00:03:54.150> is

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
jogging the other disadvantage is

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.660 
jogging the other disadvantage is
pollution<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.830> should<00:03:56.130> be<00:03:56.250> taken<00:03:56.520> into

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
pollution and that should be taken into

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.720

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
in smog or polluted air can actually do

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.920 
in smog or polluted air can actually do
more<00:04:02.070> damage<00:04:02.250> than<00:04:02.520> good<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.630> is

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
more damage than good and this is

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.510 
more damage than good and this is
something<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.680> think<00:04:04.830> about

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
something to think about

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.700 
something to think about
I'll<00:04:06.940> ask<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.360> would<00:04:07.570> be<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.990> motivation<00:04:08.470> ship
