quickly by taking some really basic
ideas<00:00:21.279> that<00:00:21.520> we<00:00:21.610> covered<00:00:21.940> in<00:00:22.029> the<00:00:22.150> last<00:00:22.180> video

quickly evolved into the left hand doing

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.030 
quickly evolved into the left hand doing
something<00:00:37.420> slightly<00:00:38.019> different<00:00:38.860> than<00:00:38.979> what
