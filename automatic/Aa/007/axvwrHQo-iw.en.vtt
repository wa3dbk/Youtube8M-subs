the camera is also only okay I mean it's

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.589

not<00:05:57.589> bad<00:05:57.800> at<00:05:57.979> all<00:05:58.069> but<00:05:58.339> often<00:05:58.879> it<00:05:58.969> really<00:05:59.389> picks

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
not bad at all but often it really picks

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.689
