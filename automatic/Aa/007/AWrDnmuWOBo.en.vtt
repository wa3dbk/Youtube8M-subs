well<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.520> was<00:04:02.760> surprisingly<00:04:04.220> anticlimactic

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
well that was surprisingly anticlimactic

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.630 
well that was surprisingly anticlimactic
seems<00:04:06.180> anytime<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.010> start<00:04:08.010> something<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.489> the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
seems anytime I start something with the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:32.330 
seems anytime I start something with the
remote<00:04:09.000> arm<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.720> lame<00:04:09.930> experiment<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
remote arm it's a lame experiment and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.300 
remote arm it's a lame experiment and
here's<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.150> top<00:04:33.419> that<00:04:33.750> pop<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.530> guess<00:04:38.010> if

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
here's the top that pop so I guess if

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.820 
here's the top that pop so I guess if
you<00:04:38.550> want<00:04:39.350> some<00:04:40.350> turd<00:04:40.740> biscuits<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:42.830> can

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.760 
you want some turd biscuits you can
microwave<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.790> tin<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.060> biscuits<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.389> was

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
microwave a tin of biscuits and this was

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.070 
microwave a tin of biscuits and this was
kind<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.950> disappointing<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.060> was<00:04:54.270> hoping<00:04:54.780> it

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
kind of disappointing I was hoping it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.219 
kind of disappointing I was hoping it
would<00:04:55.260> blow<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.560> door<00:04:55.979> open

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
would blow the door open

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.550 
would blow the door open
it<00:04:58.580> wasn't<00:04:59.580> even<00:04:59.700> as<00:05:00.090> close<00:05:00.330> doing<00:05:01.200> something

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
it wasn't even as close doing something

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.390 
it wasn't even as close doing something
like<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.770> jar<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.340> baby<00:05:02.580> food<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.160> have

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
like a jar of baby food you and I have

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.350 
like a jar of baby food you and I have
to<00:05:05.669> declare<00:05:06.090> this<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:07.740> be<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:08.280> shitty<00:05:08.850> idea

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.390 

because<00:05:12.360> not<00:05:13.080> only<00:05:13.110> do<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:16.530> biscuits<00:05:17.100> look

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
because not only do the biscuits look

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.629 
because not only do the biscuits look
like<00:05:17.669> turds<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.690> was<00:05:19.650> something<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.340> thought

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
like turds but was something I thought

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.180 
like turds but was something I thought
was<00:05:20.940> going<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.240> be<00:05:21.300> really<00:05:21.900> cool<00:05:22.169> but<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.889> was

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
was going to be really cool but it was

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.669 
was going to be really cool but it was
very<00:05:23.910> mediocre<00:05:24.979> kind<00:05:25.979> of<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.460> VCR
