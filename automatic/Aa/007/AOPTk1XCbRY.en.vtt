00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 who says that it is not fair and in that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.670
 photoshop tutorial cs 6 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.650
 I'll teach you to you it's like 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 change eye color 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 so we'll use an image 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.910
 very simple at first and through it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.380
 people are going to make some modifications 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.020
 remembering that I'm using 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.149
 photoshop cs 6 but that does not stop 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 you have the same effect in other 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 versions and I 'm going to teach you here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 two very simple forms and it is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 very good for you can do 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 Come on, you're the one in the open file. 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 open here an image that I have to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 catch this image right eye ok image 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.570
 returned gold bought more to give a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 little amplification and from this is the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.130
 We have our law is here in 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.409
 background or automatically 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 photoshop a black out 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.330
 so we come here in the law of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.350
 background select and give a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 oj 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.080
 Why are you always advising me? 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 when you want to apply some kind 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 effects work with layers 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.810
 and do not use only the image at first 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 background because sometimes you make a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 change in the bottom layer not 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.880
 It is real and alternating ie you can not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 modify again then advise 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.530
 create a new social layer this layer 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 two gold and on it will apply to all 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 and happy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 so it's the first form of us 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.610
 The eye is modified using the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.399
 class tool or we come 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.009
 here in the loop tool or by pressing 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.810
 he has mastery of her and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.810
 it will automatically be here 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.630
 the mouse for you to select what you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 would you like 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.310
 so we come here in the eye when there is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.550
 one more control remembering that I 'm in the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.170
 layer the two eye I created 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.780
 match against oj 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:35.910
 and let's select here around the eye 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:40.500
 in making a selection from it to 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.290
 people will apply the effects as it is 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.670
 just a demo class I 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.220
 I am doing is done a little more 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.830
 speak by selecting area from days 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.330
 We have selected area and we are going to come 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.760
 here in court and put the içá tourism 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.280
 that is, we will create a saturation in 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.710
 selected area by clicking on the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.260
 axis status and automatically it 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.190
 created a layer if we will modify 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.190
 on here 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.530
 realize that the eye already changes only 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.660
 it's in the key that we want 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 see what happens 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.020
 we will enable modified called 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 by rais and enabling it what 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.330
 happens we have total control over 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.210
 the things that we want yours 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.130
 modifying here eye automatically 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:40.920
 It's going to change right, I'll put it here. 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:43.740
 clearest example of this calculation and the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:51.060
 people are leaving more alive lighter 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:52.440
 Right eye I'll leave that green what 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750
 It happened 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.390
 he created a new law and from the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.530
 The selection that we have created it goes down 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.390
 tourism or her and did was change color 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.470
 so if we take the elevation to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.480
 people can see that the owl's eye 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.820
 This is one of the ways to 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.700
 modify by is with another way 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.220
 also that I strongly advise that I 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.150
 I think it's practical to do 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:28.750
 only maybe not even so profitable 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.400
 to do is to use the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.500
 elite lime merit 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.260
 so what happens from you 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.550
 may be to have dominion over it by 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.580
 n key 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.800
 So we zoom in and out. 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.140
 From her we will circle in 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.370
 around the eye or we'll go 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.570
 making a selection around the eye that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.540
 happens 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.790
 it automatically generates the selection 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.750
 which will surely have an extra Sunday 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.090
 of your mouse you can 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.480
 select but more perfectly here 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.370
 in common selection is from there to 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.210
 people will do the same principle as the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.450
 another with someone here with it to turkish 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.460
 enabled corals and we will win the 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:25.250
 things just maybe it gets even better than 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:29.330
 also mention day increasing here what 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.620
 the eye also happens automatically 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.250
 changes color 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.250
 right 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.010
 so this is the second way to do it 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.530
 there are other forms also only 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.790
 that way you least spend time and 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.780
 it's faster 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.040
 automatically then this is it guys 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.200
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.320
 let my blog access is to hurt the 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.250
 blogspot.com design site and the 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.690
 company www.voeazul.com.br 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.690
 That's it until the next
