00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 gameplay first screen today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.400
 called good then her on this game 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.889
 made the company glu mobile and trp g 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.929
 let's see no and here you can 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 choose one of three types of heroes 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 available initially give now 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 create a new hero look at all 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.289
 here is a warrior this is a peasant with some kind 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.740
 one ax there is a girl archer all 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.460
 here magic lights up with wings 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 further we go necromancer goes further 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 sorceress and then what awaits us yet 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.940
 assassin and knight and knight girls 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.710
 let's choose a necromancer for some reason 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.289
 always not or planned 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 and well, I do n’t know how to play with them 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.170
 choose a random name and run this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 the game 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.489
 we start by getting into 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 some 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 did not know the acacia here the trees and so on 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 management is rudimentary 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.400
 done with the joystick and with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.900
 using the necromancer shooting button 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 up in our case shoots with 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 his magic somehow 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.439
 fireball is not the same necromancer can 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.049
 summon some more undead which 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.080
 will go after him and kill everyone 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.330
 enemies that will threaten him 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.970
 very sad and time so i love this 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.840
 class of necromancers, in principle, a good RB 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 lamb but basically what I don't expect 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.060
 like all games from glu mobile they are on it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.610
 probably will be terribly donatnoe but 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 Basically a good toy to play it 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 you can sit in the future of course worth 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320
 see how much will be 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 sorry donat but I don't have time for this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.969
 because I think you need to at least level up 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 5 go to feel how 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.590
 hard donat here in general support 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.939
 pretty good quality and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.100
 She works exclusively with 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.250
 internet enabled second game 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.250
 call nine lives kaysen sphinx 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.649
 it is a platform and quite unusual 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.080
 let's click new game start with 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.940
 first level feature is the platform 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.680
 is that here you will 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.950
 play for two players 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.150
 at the same time more precisely not at the same time 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.069
 alternately switching between them 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.019
 because some action can 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 perform only one of them either they 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.430
 can perform this action only when 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.610
 help each other in general in what 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.430
 is the meaning and the scenario of the game is the meaning 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.519
 play in the fact that supposedly this one 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.890
 the guard broke some Egyptian 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.650
 a piece dedicated to the Egyptian goddess 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.060
 which looks like a cat form they are very 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.030
 I understand Egyptian mythology 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.850
 so I will say this shortly and after 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.489
 this person's soul has changed with the soul 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.840
 cats and now that is our guard from 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.970
 window the window is the guard that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.310
 we will first therefore the behavior of y 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.980
 our guard to be quite strange he 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.019
 there licked and so on so here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 there are such checkpoints if you 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.310
 will die 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.940
 you will rise exactly on this 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.349
 place your last checkpoint together 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.230
 management here is quite convenient 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.470
 two buttons left right hitting button 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.760
 jump button and action button and so 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.459
 here's the cat feature 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.010
 as you see the cat does not fall for 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.319
 spikes and therefore we put it in the middle 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.410
 now switch to our main 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.049
 hero jump our spoon and unfortunately 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.900
 why it didn’t work 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.630
 try now to do it again 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.299
 because when I first played 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.930
 I basically got it and I 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.870
 calmly passed this location is necessary 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.270
 jump on the cat again and by in general 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.340
 here's the meaning after that 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.830
 climb on will be necessary 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.690
 smash various things click on 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.450
 various buttons and one of the characters 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.060
 so that 2 for example could pass in 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 general platformer interesting though he 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.500
 the graphics are not exactly good but 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.470
 the idea is very interesting and in principle 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.310
 the game is very keen on the third game 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.959
 called an expander that's enough 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.390
 minimalistic unpretentious arcade to 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.940
 who will help you pass the time 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.310
 about ten or fifteen minutes after playing it 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.740
 It is made in stylish graphics on 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.480
 unity engine like most probably games 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.910
 on android and in general on mobile 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.730
 devices, and so we need to do to us 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.160
 you need to shoot down these platforms here 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.340
 and for example 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 but how to say change color in order 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.810
 to change the trajectory of your arrival 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.180
 that is, if you tap the screen then you 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.830
 level up and 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.080
 turns into the blue square 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.530
 the most you can't beat down red if 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.540
 you don't keep you on the lower level 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.250
 beat only red you need 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.970
 drive as far as you can 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.830
 noticed 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:17.490
 the camera angle changes periodically 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.110
 and also what else happens a lot 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.830
 obstacles you need on everything 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.140
 to react 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.360
 change size change height and so on 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.950
 it is very difficult makes the brain 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.080
 work a little differently 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.630
 And here is sometimes even a little change of camera 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.410
 it complicates your task in general 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 good enough arcade something 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.600
 new something original with a very 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.310
 fresh and creative ideas 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.130
 the last grant today is called war 2 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.500
 crazy bomber idea this game is not new but 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.410
 it's just crazy at the beginning 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.630
 brainwashing toy and that's it 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.450
 thanks to her graphics she is here 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.250
 probably a little childish game 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.650
 drew a child and by the way she is all 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.660
 filled with some kind of jews masonic 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.409
 the symbol is not like this mountain with 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.409
 by one 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.239
 what's worth only this 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.939
 man become very much like 

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:14.309
 Hitler whom he also filled Hitler 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.889
 put your finger up also here sometimes 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:20.539
 there are such incomprehensible media here 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.139
 legs are characters very similar to 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.229
 orthodox jews 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:29.039
 which of course also surprises and causes 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.949
 big smile is very good here about 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.529
 hand-drawn animation of explosions is not exactly 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.399
 explosions of how your scatter 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.789
 rivals 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:42.929
 they fly to guts and to others 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:45.419
 various parts of the human body 

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:48.269
 let's say here so here you already 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.009
 obstacles appear that you will 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:52.259
 a little disturb and you need to 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.479
 the parade will first break this one 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:58.489
 icy thing to have 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:01.249
 get to your enemies in general 

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:03.509
 The idea of ​​the game as I said is not new, but 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:05.789
 done very interesting very 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.189
 qualitatively and in principle chopped into 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:10.169
 I think it can be many similar genre 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:13.679
 I like them very much 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:16.559
 and here it is just a graph of this 

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:19.379
 the effect is not poured me a man into small 

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:21.809
 the pieces are also very happy kind of cruelty 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.419
 it is very cool everybody thank you very much 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:26.429
 for your attention with you was a captive game
