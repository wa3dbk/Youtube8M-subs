I<00:00:56.000> believe<00:00:56.330> within<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.080> Toronto<00:00:57.470> region<00:00:57.680> is

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
I believe within the Toronto region is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.580 
I believe within the Toronto region is
Yorkville<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.910> Eaton<00:00:59.870> Centre<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:00.290> has<00:01:00.560> a

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
Yorkville and Eaton Centre that has a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.700 
Yorkville and Eaton Centre that has a
Giorgio<00:01:01.070> Armani<00:01:01.840> stand<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:03.140> think<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.530> can

foggy<00:01:18.350> believe<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.070> was<00:01:19.219> between<00:01:19.570> $60<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.950> $65

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
up the price and annotate it so it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.260

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
what the finished product actually looks

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.169 
what the finished product actually looks
like<00:01:54.499> but<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.770> did<00:01:55.069> like<00:01:55.249> the<00:01:55.280> consistency

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
like but I did like the consistency

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.929 
like but I did like the consistency
because<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.569> looks<00:01:56.780> very<00:01:57.170> close<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:58.310> skin<00:01:58.670> it's

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
because it looks very close to skin it's

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.539 
because it looks very close to skin it's
one<00:01:59.179> of<00:01:59.329> those<00:01:59.479> foundations<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.950> wear<00:02:01.249> and

one of those foundations you wear and

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.830 
one of those foundations you wear and
people<00:02:01.850> don't<00:02:01.969> know<00:02:02.329> if<00:02:02.479> you're<00:02:02.659> wearing

I don't know if you can see that but it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.290 
I don't know if you can see that but it
is<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:11.200> shade<00:02:12.200> 13<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.370> again<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.180> the

I felt about it so I definitely like

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.170

that<00:04:54.810> it's<00:04:55.810> very<00:04:56.110> light<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.710> has<00:04:57.030> excuse<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that it's very light it has excuse the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.680 
that it's very light it has excuse the
dirtiness<00:04:58.540> but<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:58.960> does<00:04:59.170> have<00:04:59.500> an<00:04:59.920> actual

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690

pump which is great I don't understand

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.820

so<00:06:06.580> really<00:06:07.270> definitely<00:06:08.170> recommend<00:06:09.130> it<00:06:09.370> even

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
so really definitely recommend it even

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.510 
so really definitely recommend it even
though<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.540> splurge<00:06:11.140> it<00:06:11.620> is<00:06:12.100> definitely

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
though it is a splurge it is definitely

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.180 
though it is a splurge it is definitely
a<00:06:12.550> good<00:06:12.730> spurge<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.330> I<00:06:13.390> think<00:06:13.810> especially<00:06:14.290> for

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
a good spurge and I think especially for

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.850 
a good spurge and I think especially for
summer<00:06:15.880> this<00:06:16.210> will<00:06:16.360> be<00:06:16.540> my<00:06:16.690> go-to<00:06:17.230> because<00:06:17.650> I

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
summer this will be my go-to because I

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.560 
summer this will be my go-to because I
don't<00:06:18.190> really<00:06:18.280> like<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.670> have<00:06:18.790> too<00:06:19.090> much<00:06:19.240> on<00:06:19.450> my

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
don't really like to have too much on my

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.170 
don't really like to have too much on my
face<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.200> like<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.710> very<00:06:21.130> light<00:06:21.490> feeling<00:06:21.940> and

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
face and I like a very light feeling and

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.230 
face and I like a very light feeling and
this<00:06:22.600> definitely<00:06:23.200> provides<00:06:24.190> it<00:06:24.520> it<00:06:24.940> doesn't

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
this definitely provides it it doesn't

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.590 
this definitely provides it it doesn't
have<00:06:25.420> any<00:06:25.810> strange<00:06:26.380> smell<00:06:27.160> or<00:06:27.640> any<00:06:27.970> of<00:06:28.180> like

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
have any strange smell or any of like

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.190 
have any strange smell or any of like
rancid<00:06:29.110> smell<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.830> some<00:06:30.900> foundations<00:06:31.900> have

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
rancid smell that some foundations have

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.350 
rancid smell that some foundations have
and<00:06:32.530> as<00:06:32.920> I<00:06:33.040> said<00:06:33.220> I<00:06:33.250> feel<00:06:33.610> like<00:06:33.640> the<00:06:33.850> coverage

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
and as I said I feel like the coverage

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.920 
and as I said I feel like the coverage
is<00:06:34.630> pretty<00:06:35.080> decent<00:06:35.440> for<00:06:35.770> my<00:06:36.130> skin<00:06:36.970> condition

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
is pretty decent for my skin condition

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.920 
is pretty decent for my skin condition
currently

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.280
