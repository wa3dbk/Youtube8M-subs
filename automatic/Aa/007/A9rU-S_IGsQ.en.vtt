00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think we can all agree that one of the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
think we can all agree that one of the
biggest<00:01:33.539> flaws<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.740> last<00:01:35.100> gen<00:01:35.399> phone

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
biggest flaws with the last gen phone

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.290 
biggest flaws with the last gen phone
was<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.750> camera<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:38.009> HTC<00:01:38.610> uses<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
was the camera because HTC uses this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.139 
was the camera because HTC uses this
ultra<00:01:39.750> pixel<00:01:39.929> technology<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> good

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
ultra pixel technology which is a good

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.960 
ultra pixel technology which is a good
idea<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.470> reality<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:44.310> photos<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
idea but in reality the photos and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.359 
idea but in reality the photos and
videos<00:01:45.300> that<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.539> made<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
videos that have made was not as good as

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
videos that have made was not as good as
the<00:01:47.549> competition<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.810> luckily<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
phone which is going to be a massive

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
phone which is going to be a massive
enhancement<00:01:57.930> over<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> last<00:01:58.680> gen<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
enhancement over the last gen and as you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
enhancement over the last gen and as you
may<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.119> lately<00:02:00.719> HTC<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.560> been<00:02:01.799> killing<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
may know lately HTC has been killing it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
may know lately HTC has been killing it
when<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> comes<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> front<00:02:03.090> facing<00:02:03.450> cameras

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
when it comes to front facing cameras

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
when it comes to front facing cameras
and<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.619> looks<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.189> m9<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:05.850> going

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and it looks like on the m9 we're going

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
and it looks like on the m9 we're going
to<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> 13<00:02:06.899> megapixel<00:02:07.079> front-facing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to have a 13 megapixel front-facing

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.310 
to have a 13 megapixel front-facing
selfie<00:02:08.369> cam<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.570> should<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.959> nice

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
selfie cam so that should be a nice

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.720 
selfie cam so that should be a nice
addition<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.829> those<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.579> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
addition for those of you that like to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.600 
addition for those of you that like to
take<00:02:11.910> selfies<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.560> looks<00:02:13.769> like<00:02:13.860> HTC<00:02:14.130> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
take selfies but it looks like HTC is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.069 
take selfies but it looks like HTC is
finally<00:02:15.120> ditching<00:02:15.510> at<00:02:15.630> ultra<00:02:15.900> pixel

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
finally ditching at ultra pixel

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.530 
finally ditching at ultra pixel
technology<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> say<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.970> am<00:02:18.150> glad

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
technology and I have to say I am glad

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.229 
technology and I have to say I am glad
to<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.019> go<00:02:19.290> once<00:02:20.130> again<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.549> was<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> good

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
to see that go once again it was a good

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.210 
to see that go once again it was a good
idea<00:02:21.269> because<00:02:21.810> megapixels<00:02:22.650> don't<00:02:22.920> always

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
idea because megapixels don't always

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.160 
idea because megapixels don't always
mean<00:02:23.430> everything<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.600> once<00:02:24.780> again<00:02:24.930> in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
mean everything but once again in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
mean everything but once again in
reality<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.130> photos<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.760> videos<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.390> add

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
reality the photos and videos I can add

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.599 
reality the photos and videos I can add
up<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.840> ultra<00:02:28.140> pixel<00:02:28.290> technology<00:02:28.609> just

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
up that ultra pixel technology just

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.210 
up that ultra pixel technology just
wasn't<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.209> good<00:02:30.450> as<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> competition<00:02:31.470> now

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
wasn't as good as the competition now

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160 
wasn't as good as the competition now
when<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.459> comes<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> battery<00:02:33.390> capacity<00:02:33.989> of

when it comes to the battery capacity of

the HTC One m9 the linked info that we

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.050 
the HTC One m9 the linked info that we

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060

hundred forty million battery capacity

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.580 
hundred forty million battery capacity
which<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.209> bit<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.959> low<00:02:43.260> side

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
which is a little bit on the low side

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
which is a little bit on the low side
because<00:02:44.070> most<00:02:44.340> new<00:02:44.579> phones<00:02:44.850> have<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.239> capacity

because most new phones have a capacity

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.740 
because most new phones have a capacity
above<00:02:46.170> 3000<00:02:46.950> milliamps<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> especially<00:02:48.359> with

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.760 
saying that it could be a 3500
battery<00:02:56.220> capacity<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.560> doubt

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
battery capacity but I kind of doubt

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.190 
battery capacity but I kind of doubt
that<00:02:58.880> unless<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.940> phone<00:03:00.240> does<00:03:00.569> indeed<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:00.959> a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that unless the phone does indeed have a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.040 
that unless the phone does indeed have a
5.5<00:03:02.010> inch<00:03:02.250> display<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.270> three<00:03:03.690> thousand

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
5.5 inch display then a three thousand

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.690 
5.5 inch display then a three thousand
five<00:03:04.200> hundred<00:03:04.230> million<00:03:04.770> battery<00:03:05.040> capacity<00:03:05.520> is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
five hundred million battery capacity is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.960 
five hundred million battery capacity is
definitely<00:03:06.360> possible<00:03:06.830> but<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.130> opinion<00:03:08.280> if

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
definitely possible but in my opinion if

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.809 
definitely possible but in my opinion if
the<00:03:09.209> displays<00:03:09.660> 5.2<00:03:10.440> inches<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.100> think<00:03:11.730> we're

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
the displays 5.2 inches I think we're

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.190 
the displays 5.2 inches I think we're
going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.480> two<00:03:12.690> thousand<00:03:13.140> eight

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
going to have this two thousand eight

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.900 
going to have this two thousand eight
hundred<00:03:13.260> forty<00:03:13.830> million<00:03:14.010> battery<00:03:14.430> capacity

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
hundred forty million battery capacity

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180 
hundred forty million battery capacity
which<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.930> said<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> little<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:16.980> low

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
which like I said is a little bit low

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190 
which like I said is a little bit low
and<00:03:17.459> as<00:03:17.850> expected<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.510> phone<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.930> going<00:03:19.080> to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and as expected the phone is going to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.979 
and as expected the phone is going to
launch<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:19.770> android<00:03:20.280> 5.1<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.090> inside<00:03:21.420> with

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
launch with android 5.1 the inside with

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.229 
launch with android 5.1 the inside with
a<00:03:22.020> sense<00:03:22.440> seven<00:03:22.950> skin<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.400> top<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.209> that

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
a sense seven skin on top of it and that

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
a sense seven skin on top of it and that
is<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:25.380> news<00:03:25.410> when<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:25.890> comes<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
is good news when it comes to the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.190 
is good news when it comes to the
battery<00:03:26.700> life<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.630> five<00:03:27.840> point<00:03:28.110> 0

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.260 
battery life because the five point 0
