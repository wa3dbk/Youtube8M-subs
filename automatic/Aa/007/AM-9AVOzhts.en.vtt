but<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.060> say<00:02:19.360> seven<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.410> think<00:02:20.710> though<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
but we say seven we think though the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.360 
but we say seven we think though the
phone<00:02:22.210> function<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:23.110> very<00:02:23.440> quite<00:02:23.710> important

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
and also it's very compact size the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.010 
and also it's very compact size the
perfect<00:02:27.520> solution<00:02:27.790> gets<00:02:28.240> better<00:02:28.510> than<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
perfect solution gets better than the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.530 
perfect solution gets better than the
combined<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> communication<00:02:30.880> or<00:02:31.300> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
combined with the communication or the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.660 
combined with the communication or the
slices

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670
