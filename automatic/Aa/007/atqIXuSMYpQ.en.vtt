00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello to all and hypno on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.849
 finds himself today for a new 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.830
 gameplay on the steam chain you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 have seen there I have just arrived in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 the game is really the capture I 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 will start at the very beginning of the game 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 so we were a good part of the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 team ridge as well as company 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 some subscribers so I had rachel 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 kuna there was myself there are tyson 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 in rage who is with us that day 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 so on the map overflow if I get 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
 wrong in domination there was rage 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.000
 doggy dog so I quoted you as 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.230
 and as an asshole anchor I wanted 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 if you are already there was m h 34 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.559
 touch there were still others 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 who do not appear for the moment 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.510
 you saw that rather quickly we 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 found on the flag a 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 unfortunately I did not capture I 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 will explain to you why in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.890
 a few moments so here it is with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.960
 hunter for tyson and me even my 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.230
 capture and see that we have the three 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.690
 positions and from that moment on 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.560
 the game will take another turn at 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.600
 earlier another one how would I say 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 we had our way of seeing things 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 so I did not have time to finally see 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 in short, we are accompanied by beautiful males 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.930
 subscribers and some members of the team 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 rage as you saw guide Kunar 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.630
 to the room gentlemen than to tasks 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 so tyson at the rajiv enter in n-e 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 center and demonic ns that's I 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 thanks as a subscriber and others 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.360
 are you will see them in blue all over 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.090
 the time so in fact it was a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.540
 classical part where we would play in 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.130
 domination and very quickly 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.530
 look at it in the passage towards a quota 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 triple fidh on my part and migration from 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.360
 the other one and very quickly actually I 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.830
 am more so hunter or demonic tns to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.840
 to unlock a lot of fat that strict 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.400
 as well as myself and everyone 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
 was in good shape and we had all 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.960
 the poses and then I do not know at which 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.370
 moment of the game precisely but a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.660
 moment we said but wait for them 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.640
 guys there we are doing a 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.200
 almost total dominance since as 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120
 you know it on black ops it's not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.620
 obvious since you have two sleeves 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.970
 so as I already explained the 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.430
 first time another body it was 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.130
 for info two hundred to 21 if I get 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.720
 not deceive one so 201 21 what is 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.430
 really not bad already on black ops 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.450
 of NATO before arriving to make 200 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.580
 because we could make 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.500
 pomegranate spots to prevent the enemy 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.170
 take the first position now 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.160
 already the grenades are only working 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.770
 more in the first second 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.810
 all the explosives and besides that and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.489
 well there are two innings so that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.560
 really complicates the thing so 200 to 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.550
 21 the record to beat today is so 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080
 I'll meet you tomorrow, that's all 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 just a look at the hunter who 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.770
 just made a quad pass 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.480
 or a 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.150
 just opposite he did not make a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.740
 fifteen or even to a sylph 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.840
 shelling and there you saw doggy 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.540
 dog what is in his lot of stars me 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.220
 I am a series of 10 I already have 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.140
 unlocked my dogs but group of 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.570
 hunting and my first orbital station 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.690
 so there's so much to say do you imagine there 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.440
 even though at that time accurate 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.020
 so it's true that I should not have 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.310
 send right away I have not done 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.110
 gaffe at the beginning than 10 years old will send 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.570
 on the other one but tell you well that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.430
 the enemy still has above 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.560
 him a lot of stars on the ground the dogs 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750
 who comes to flush out more but group 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.000
 hunting it's just unbearable for 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.620
 the enemy and oddly I say well 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.480
 oddly in this part as much 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.950
 perform as much as it came back from a 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.440
 other side so it was still 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.580
 nice to the only thing single point 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.650
 negative is that you will see that the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.240
 domination is going to be quite expeditious this 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.930
 that will prevent us from making a big 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.790
 big massacre 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.490
 although my reassure you will see and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.620
 is a very big at ratio is a very 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.630
 good heavens wine in this part and you 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.340
 have seen one clearly there I'm doing the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.650
 spawn kg level to since the goal is 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.810
 to make sure to do the most 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.100
 big domination possible so I 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.830
 always the same turn me I'm at 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.940
 level 2 to others of the team me I 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.570
 am with like kunar 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.640
 at level 2 to others are at level 2b 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.530
 a strap that had tiger and level 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.860
 of these it seems to me that it was doggy 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.780
 dog 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.180
 so here we go 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.430
 tyson also I think be verb and finally 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.319
 So here we were not badly in the process of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.030
 manage domination and we thought 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.830
 anyway because we dominate them 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.569
 widely 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.700
 it's going anyway is a part 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.160
 expeditious roads go h who so much 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.500
 play the domination leva more total 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.419
 possible so there you see that in the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300
 first run and is already at 118 to 8 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.620
 so basically the eight points they have 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.840
 believed it was just the time we 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.430
 return from our position to theirs see 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.470
 that the young woman my 15th and nice in 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.690
 to die and then I still continue my 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.460
 little genre series unleashes a new 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.290
 a new rather micro station 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.290
 orbital and you saw did you 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.190
 have seen the spot there actually if you 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.360
 want when you have the three 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.260
 positions look as soon as I go 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.330
 go through the door 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.910
 it will have taken I still continue one or 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.350
 two meters the enemy off rspo next to 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.300
 at 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.280
 that's if if we leave this building the 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.520
 nivat henry spawn pretty much that's where he 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.950
 is in phase there is a little on the left 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.870
 you see that the always I chain 20 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.800
 little ones in a row and this is only 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.440
 the first run 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.729
 there I'm doing the 21st and unblocks player to 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.500
 new but hunting group so I 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.600
 send them right away I'm not losing 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.330
 time since anyway I got 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.979
 says the goal is still to try to 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.140
 to ensure that the enemy can not 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.830
 not capture position so that's right 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.030
 that I decided wrongly it's 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.680
 true that I could have kept it since 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.510
 really stayed 30 seconds and I think 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.460
 that look they are more than 4 30 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.410
 seconds 9 against 4 knowing that we have the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.729
 total monopoly over the positions we 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.050
 is all properly placed 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.430
 I think I could have done without 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.289
 to send my hunting group and the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.000
 send on the second run but good 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.270
 in doubt it's true that I 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.979
 favorite send my hunting group 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.490
 So here is the round just taken 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.310
 finish I do 1 36 01 field 34.0 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.080
 tyson at 26.5 end yes really big 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.510
 ratio see really happy dominates 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.449
 really part of from the beginning up 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.409
 the end and there we are anyway 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.749
 at 266 to 8 whose dominance is almost 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.159
 finished it remains a round to see you 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.229
 see all this kit with nouba here I 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.689
 have them all there was flowers here 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.539
 besides rachkov their soul and waxing 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.610
 buzzer ok okay so that's it 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.069
 simply 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.659
 raschkowan who had changed vegetatively 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.059
 of fax gamer and a new tale that 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.589
 was created because his had been 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.210
 view had been blocked I do not know anymore 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.219
 find more and pass short 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.889
 So here it is it's raging flowers 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.449
 because for the little anecdote you have to 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.039
 know he has his little wife when he 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.710
 plays who is next to him and who sleeps 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.539
 and who snore walla snoring anchor 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.339
 here you see that the nights are 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.370
 scored three points so a layer 3 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:39.439
 necessarily 11 and there we have again 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.629
 positions I'm going away again on the 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.550
 catch of a then I do not even know 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.349
 if I'm still in series I have not 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.740
 beware I think I must be at 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:51.649
 22,23 frag in a row and I continue to 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.240
 protect at and then the goal is going to be to do 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:54.379
 so that the enemy does not take anymore 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.770
 nothing you saw I went out you 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:07:00.349
 have seen the respawn spot so here I have 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.849
 could once again align an enemy and at this 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.050
 moment there I know that I am mashed I 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.180
 could do a nuclear but 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.189
 unfortunately to the domination is going 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.709
 will escape us very quickly it will go 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.209
 very quickly 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:13.660
 I do not even know if I'm going to have the 

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:16.300
 time if maybe to unlock 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.190
 the 25 he's in a row so brutal and 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.170
 no domination ends on a 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.000
 score of 40 to 0 and especially a 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.710
 domination 200 to 11 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.720
 so we can say that this is one of 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.850
 dominations the most total 1 not total 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.440
 but the most total of which I you 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.880
 invite to do the same and 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.410
 to try to beat our record which is 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.480
 now from two hundred to eleven and no 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.760
 plus two hundred to 21 so send us 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.530
 a little screen like that to see a 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.270
 little challenge that I'm throwing at you 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.870
 subscribers if you have teams of 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.820
 friends etc 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.800
 to try to do better than 200 to 11 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.430
 so it's possible and still has the 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.390
 margin 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.560
 in any case I wish you good 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.030
 luck I hope this video has you 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.430
 more if small challenges like that of the 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.660
 orange team make you happy and well 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.190

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.680
 way we will find ourselves very 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.360
 soon for a 2nd c1 a 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.220
 confirmed elimination of the most total 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.780

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.370
