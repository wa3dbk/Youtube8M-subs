talk to me a little bit about what the
prep<00:01:03.379> was<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:03.890> because<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.759> are

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
prep was like this because you are

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.670 
prep was like this because you are
planning<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.630> picking<00:01:05.750> next<00:01:06.170> week<00:01:06.320> correct

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
planning on picking next week correct

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.370 
planning on picking next week correct
yeah<00:01:07.160> um<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:08.420> my<00:01:08.539> training<00:01:08.960> was<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.110> little

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
yeah um that my training was a little

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.740 
yeah um that my training was a little
bit<00:01:09.500> different<00:01:09.950> my<00:01:10.759> food<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.180> takes<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.600> lot

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
bit different my food and takes a lot

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.749 
bit different my food and takes a lot
different<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:12.350> time<00:01:12.410> around<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.399> i<00:01:13.430> guess

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
different this time around so i guess

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.480 
different this time around so i guess
the<00:01:13.940> prep<00:01:14.149> as<00:01:14.420> far<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:14.960> my<00:01:15.560> cutting<00:01:16.220> water
