00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
TR 102 part of the transcribing course

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.680 
TR 102 part of the transcribing course
and<00:00:10.580> this<00:00:10.760> lesson<00:00:11.000> we're<00:00:11.330> going<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.600> be

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
and this lesson we're going to be

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.760 
and this lesson we're going to be
learning<00:00:11.990> how<00:00:12.320> to<00:00:12.350> write<00:00:12.799> tab<00:00:13.280> now<00:00:14.090> to

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
learning how to write tab now to

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.650 
learning how to write tab now to
transcribe<00:00:15.770> obviously<00:00:16.760> involves<00:00:17.210> writing

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
transcribe obviously involves writing

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.870 
transcribe obviously involves writing
down<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.050> scribe<00:00:18.410> part<00:00:18.770> there<00:00:18.980> right<00:00:19.190> so<00:00:19.460> it's

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
down the scribe part there right so it's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.220 
down the scribe part there right so it's
really<00:00:20.240> important<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:20.690> you<00:00:20.870> learn<00:00:21.020> how<00:00:21.200> to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
really important that you learn how to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.050 
really important that you learn how to
transcribe<00:00:21.710> I<00:00:22.070> don't<00:00:22.370> think<00:00:22.550> really<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.820> video

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
transcribe I don't think really a video

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.000 
transcribe I don't think really a video
lesson<00:00:23.600> is<00:00:23.720> probably<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.170> best<00:00:24.440> medium<00:00:24.980> for

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
lesson is probably the best medium for

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.880 
lesson is probably the best medium for
teaching<00:00:25.640> writing<00:00:26.360> I<00:00:26.540> believe<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.440> writing

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
teaching writing I believe that writing

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.470 
teaching writing I believe that writing
and<00:00:28.010> reading<00:00:28.220> is<00:00:28.490> going<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:28.850> be<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.090> way<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.240> do

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
and reading is going to be the way to do

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.300 
and reading is going to be the way to do
it<00:00:29.600> so<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:29.990> would<00:00:30.170> really<00:00:30.470> strongly<00:00:30.860> suggest

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
it so I would really strongly suggest

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.589 
it so I would really strongly suggest
that<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:31.460> get<00:00:31.670> over<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.059> website<00:00:32.270> and

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
that you get over to the website and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.840 
that you get over to the website and
read<00:00:33.350> all<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.129> different<00:00:34.430> symbols<00:00:34.760> that

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
read all of the different symbols that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.250 
read all of the different symbols that
you're<00:00:35.000> going<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.210> use<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.570> then<00:00:35.960> do<00:00:36.110> the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
you're going to use and then do the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.930 
you're going to use and then do the
bunch<00:00:36.469> of<00:00:36.620> exercises<00:00:37.280> at<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.460> bottom<00:00:37.790> you're

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
bunch of exercises at the bottom you're

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.400 
bunch of exercises at the bottom you're
going<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.090> be<00:00:38.210> copying<00:00:38.600> some<00:00:38.780> stuff<00:00:39.050> out<00:00:39.260> and

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
going to be copying some stuff out and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.960 
going to be copying some stuff out and
writing<00:00:39.860> down<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> minor<00:00:40.610> pentatonic

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
writing down the a minor pentatonic

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.850 
writing down the a minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:41.480> on<00:00:41.630> some<00:00:41.810> tab<00:00:42.020> paper<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.470> checking<00:00:42.770> it

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
scale on some tab paper and checking it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.069 
scale on some tab paper and checking it
against<00:00:43.190> mine<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.880> kind<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.270> thing<00:00:44.510> that's

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
against mine that kind of thing that's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.389 
against mine that kind of thing that's
how<00:00:45.320> you're<00:00:45.500> going<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.649> learn<00:00:45.829> how<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.100> write

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
how you're going to learn how to write

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.770 
how you're going to learn how to write
down<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:46.970> can<00:00:47.180> give<00:00:47.329> you<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.480> few<00:00:47.690> little

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
down but I can give you a few little

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.900 
down but I can give you a few little
hints<00:00:48.140> right<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.920> first<00:00:49.040> thing<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.430> make

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
hints right so the first thing is make

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.880 
hints right so the first thing is make
sure<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.239> you're<00:00:50.420> using<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.989> pencil<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:51.680> a

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
sure that you're using a pencil not a

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.460 
sure that you're using a pencil not a
pen<00:00:52.130> right<00:00:52.700> I<00:00:52.880> prefer<00:00:53.450> using<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.840> mechanical

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
pen right I prefer using a mechanical

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.139 
pen right I prefer using a mechanical
pencil<00:00:54.620> because<00:00:54.920> they<00:00:55.130> stay<00:00:55.399> sharp<00:00:55.730> easier

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
pencil because they stay sharp easier

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.180 
pencil because they stay sharp easier
there<00:00:56.630> have<00:00:56.719> been<00:00:56.750> yep<00:00:57.260> just<00:00:57.559> generally<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.040> bit

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
there have been yep just generally a bit

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.470 
there have been yep just generally a bit
cooler<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:58.850> would<00:00:58.969> recommend<00:00:59.300> getting<00:00:59.420> a

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
cooler so I would recommend getting a

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.360 
cooler so I would recommend getting a
mechanical<00:00:59.989> pencil<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.680> regular<00:01:01.040> pencil

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
mechanical pencil but a regular pencil

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.250 
mechanical pencil but a regular pencil
and<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.520> pencil<00:01:01.700> sharpener<00:01:01.850> will<00:01:02.360> do<00:01:02.510> just<00:01:02.750> fine

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
and a pencil sharpener will do just fine

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.319 
and a pencil sharpener will do just fine
second<00:01:04.219> thing<00:01:04.369> make<00:01:04.610> sure<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.969> you<00:01:05.119> get<00:01:05.269> a

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
second thing make sure that you get a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.600 
second thing make sure that you get a
good<00:01:05.659> eraser<00:01:06.079> a<00:01:06.409> bad<00:01:06.740> eraser<00:01:07.100> will<00:01:07.369> just

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
good eraser a bad eraser will just

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.160 
good eraser a bad eraser will just
smudge<00:01:07.939> all<00:01:08.210> your<00:01:08.390> work<00:01:08.569> and<00:01:08.719> make<00:01:08.899> it<00:01:08.929> look

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
smudge all your work and make it look

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.289 
smudge all your work and make it look
really<00:01:09.469> messy<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:09.920> horrible<00:01:10.219> so<00:01:10.429> get<00:01:10.939> a<00:01:10.969> good

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
really messy and horrible so get a good

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.199 
really messy and horrible so get a good
eraser<00:01:11.630> they're<00:01:11.899> usually<00:01:12.109> very<00:01:12.530> soft<00:01:13.209> Stabilo

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:14.209 
eraser they're usually very soft Stabilo

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:15.969 
eraser they're usually very soft Stabilo
I<00:01:14.240> think<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.899> brand<00:01:15.109> that<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.439> like<00:01:15.649> not

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
I think is the brand that I like not

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.849 
I think is the brand that I like not
that<00:01:16.130> I'm<00:01:16.249> trying<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.880> be<00:01:17.060> all<00:01:17.090> weird<00:01:17.569> about

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
that I'm trying to be all weird about

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.559 
that I'm trying to be all weird about
erasers<00:01:18.859> but<00:01:19.069> there<00:01:19.759> are<00:01:19.880> good<00:01:19.999> erasers<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
erasers but there are good erasers and

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.359 
erasers but there are good erasers and
barrel<00:01:20.869> races<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.409> Stabilo<00:01:21.920> classic

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
barrel races and the Stabilo classic

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.830 
barrel races and the Stabilo classic
ones<00:01:22.579> are<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.909> ones<00:01:23.029> that<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:23.329> think<00:01:23.479> are<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
ones are the ones that I think are the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.749 
ones are the ones that I think are the
best<00:01:24.049> ones<00:01:24.380> if<00:01:24.590> you're<00:01:24.770> interested<00:01:25.279> being

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
best ones if you're interested being

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.099 
best ones if you're interested being
that<00:01:25.880> they<00:01:26.029> are<00:01:26.060> not<00:01:26.240> particularly<00:01:26.689> expensive

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
that they are not particularly expensive

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.309 
that they are not particularly expensive
really<00:01:28.389> okay<00:01:29.389> let's<00:01:29.600> move<00:01:29.749> on<00:01:29.899> before<00:01:30.049> you

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
really okay let's move on before you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.599 
really okay let's move on before you
just<00:01:30.469> think<00:01:30.679> that<00:01:30.799> I'm<00:01:30.920> really<00:01:31.100> weird<00:01:31.399> now<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
just think that I'm really weird now the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.099 
just think that I'm really weird now the
next<00:01:31.969> thing<00:01:32.090> really<00:01:32.389> important<00:01:32.779> is<00:01:32.929> that

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
next thing really important is that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.510 
next thing really important is that
you've<00:01:33.590> got<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:33.950> try<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.249> keep<00:01:34.369> your

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
you've got to try and keep your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.649 
you've got to try and keep your
transcriptions<00:01:35.209> neat

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
transcriptions neat

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.690 
transcriptions neat
and<00:01:35.749> usually<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.709> way<00:01:36.859> that<00:01:36.889> I<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.340> explain

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and usually the way that I can explain

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.459 
and usually the way that I can explain
that<00:01:37.880> best<00:01:38.119> is<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.479> space<00:01:38.869> everything<00:01:39.200> out

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
that best is to space everything out

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.190 
that best is to space everything out
right<00:01:39.880> there's<00:01:40.880> not<00:01:41.240> going<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.479> be<00:01:41.569> many<00:01:41.840> trees

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
right there's not going to be many trees

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.599 
right there's not going to be many trees
that<00:01:42.229> are<00:01:42.560> going<00:01:42.709> to<00:01:42.770> go<00:01:42.859> under<00:01:43.159> because<00:01:43.279> you

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
that are going to go under because you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.279 
that are going to go under because you
happen<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:43.999> write<00:01:44.209> your<00:01:44.389> tab<00:01:44.659> really<00:01:45.079> close

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
happen to write your tab really close

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.109 
happen to write your tab really close
together<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.859> manage<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.159> fit<00:01:46.459> the<00:01:46.849> whole<00:01:46.999> of

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
together and manage to fit the whole of

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.120 
together and manage to fit the whole of
the<00:01:47.209> stairway<00:01:47.599> to<00:01:47.659> heaven<00:01:48.139> solo<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.649> one<00:01:48.889> line

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the stairway to heaven solo on one line

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.620 
the stairway to heaven solo on one line
although<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:49.999> going<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.179> mean<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.450> that

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
although it's going to mean is that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.059 
although it's going to mean is that
nobody<00:01:50.959> will<00:01:51.049> really<00:01:51.349> be<00:01:51.439> able<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.709> read<00:01:51.889> it

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
nobody will really be able to read it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.489 
nobody will really be able to read it
right<00:01:52.249> so<00:01:52.759> make<00:01:53.359> sure<00:01:53.389> you<00:01:53.659> space<00:01:54.049> your<00:01:54.289> notes

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
right so make sure you space your notes

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.309 
right so make sure you space your notes
out<00:01:54.709> really<00:01:55.219> evenly<00:01:55.849> and<00:01:56.029> clearly<00:01:56.599> I'm<00:01:57.139> not

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
out really evenly and clearly I'm not

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.749 
out really evenly and clearly I'm not
saying<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:57.919> put<00:01:58.069> two<00:01:58.310> notes<00:01:58.579> on

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
saying that you just put two notes on

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.249 
saying that you just put two notes on
each<00:01:58.789> line<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.299> would<00:01:59.419> be<00:01:59.569> ridiculous<00:01:59.959> so

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
each line that would be ridiculous so

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.959 
each line that would be ridiculous so
have<00:02:00.859> a<00:02:00.919> look<00:02:01.099> at<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.279> ones<00:02:01.459> that<00:02:01.669> I've<00:02:01.789> done

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
have a look at the ones that I've done

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.760 
have a look at the ones that I've done
and<00:02:02.149> just<00:02:02.329> see<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.929> notes<00:02:03.139> are<00:02:03.319> nice<00:02:03.529> and

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and just see that the notes are nice and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
and just see that the notes are nice and
clearly<00:02:04.219> spaced<00:02:04.579> later<00:02:05.209> on<00:02:05.389> as<00:02:05.539> we<00:02:05.659> get<00:02:05.840> more

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
clearly spaced later on as we get more

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.659 
clearly spaced later on as we get more
into<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.439> especially<00:02:06.560> after<00:02:07.310> you've<00:02:07.429> done<00:02:07.609> a

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:07.669 
into it especially after you've done a

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.699 
into it especially after you've done a
bunch<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.390> these<00:02:08.539> exercises<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.319> you've<00:02:09.410> seen

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
bunch of these exercises and you've seen

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.589 
bunch of these exercises and you've seen
the<00:02:09.830> way<00:02:09.979> I've<00:02:10.130> spaced<00:02:10.580> stuff<00:02:10.849> out<00:02:11.030> you're

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
the way I've spaced stuff out you're

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.850 
the way I've spaced stuff out you're
going<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> lot<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.349> kind<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.650> better

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
going to have a lot of kind of better

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.650 
going to have a lot of kind of better
eye<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.820> you'll<00:02:13.940> be<00:02:14.090> able<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.390> kind<00:02:14.510> of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
eye for it and you'll be able to kind of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.600 
eye for it and you'll be able to kind of
already<00:02:15.230> write<00:02:15.530> things<00:02:15.830> down<00:02:15.950> into<00:02:16.340> bar

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
already write things down into bar

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.040 
already write things down into bar
groupings<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.270> stuff<00:02:17.480> by<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.720> end<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
groupings and stuff by the end of the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.820 
groupings and stuff by the end of the
course

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
course

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.740 
course
so<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:19.880> really<00:02:20.120> important<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.630> do

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so I'm that's really important to do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.380 
so I'm that's really important to do
that<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.220> don't<00:02:22.220> recommend<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> start

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
that I don't recommend that you start

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.900 
that I don't recommend that you start
with<00:02:23.480> notation<00:02:24.140> software<00:02:24.380> right<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.310> do<00:02:25.490> use<00:02:25.880> a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
with notation software right I do use a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.760 
with notation software right I do use a
program<00:02:26.390> called<00:02:26.420> Sibelius<00:02:27.170> for<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> lot<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> my

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
program called Sibelius for a lot of my

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.450 
program called Sibelius for a lot of my
tabbing<00:02:28.190> stuff<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.720> nearly<00:02:30.140> always<00:02:30.460> ya

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
tabbing stuff but I nearly always ya

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.880 
tabbing stuff but I nearly always ya
know<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:32.480> fact<00:02:32.660> pretty<00:02:32.810> much<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.140> always<00:02:33.380> write

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
know in fact pretty much I always write

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.790 
know in fact pretty much I always write
it<00:02:34.070> down<00:02:34.220> first<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.690> with<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> pencil<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
it down first on it with a pencil and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.400 
it down first on it with a pencil and
paper<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:38.060> transfer<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.900> notation

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
paper and then transfer it to a notation

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.440 
paper and then transfer it to a notation
program<00:02:39.530> afterwards<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> thing

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
program afterwards and and the thing

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.240 
program afterwards and and the thing
with<00:02:41.660> trade<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> notation<00:02:42.860> program<00:02:42.950> it's

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
with trade with a notation program it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
with trade with a notation program it's
good<00:02:43.370> for<00:02:43.520> giving<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.880> someone<00:02:44.180> else<00:02:44.330> right<00:02:44.690> so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
good for giving to someone else right so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.860 
good for giving to someone else right so
if<00:02:45.110> you've<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> give<00:02:46.130> your<00:02:46.510> tab<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.720> your

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
if you've got to give your tab to your

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.140 
if you've got to give your tab to your
friend<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> magazine<00:02:49.400> or<00:02:49.760> whatever<00:02:49.820> then

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
friend or to a magazine or whatever then

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.210 
friend or to a magazine or whatever then
it<00:02:50.270> probably<00:02:50.600> wants<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.080> proper<00:02:51.500> tab<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it probably wants to be a proper tab you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.060 
it probably wants to be a proper tab you
know<00:02:52.310> not<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> handwritten<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
know not a handwritten one but for you

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.710 
know not a handwritten one but for you
for<00:02:55.340> learning<00:02:55.430> right<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:55.820> I'd<00:02:56.240> really

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
for learning right now I'd really

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.970 
for learning right now I'd really
recommend<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.290> learn<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.860> by

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
recommend that you learn to do it by

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.500 
recommend that you learn to do it by
hand<00:02:58.220> first<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.000> that's<00:02:59.150> kind<00:02:59.420> of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
hand first I think that's kind of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.980 
hand first I think that's kind of
important<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:02.240> other<00:03:02.360> thing<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.660> can

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
important so the other thing you can

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.300 
important so the other thing you can
start<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.410> try<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.800> little<00:03:03.950> bit<00:03:04.190> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
start to try and do a little bit of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.120 
start to try and do a little bit of
space<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.820> notes<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.270> fit<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.600> rhythm<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.620> if

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
space the notes to fit the rhythm so if

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.490 
space the notes to fit the rhythm so if
you've<00:03:07.400> got<00:03:07.550> notes<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.090> are<00:03:08.209> faster<00:03:08.870> like

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
you've got notes that are faster like

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.350 
you've got notes that are faster like
you<00:03:09.890> know<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.070> would<00:03:10.340> write<00:03:10.520> them<00:03:10.730> slightly

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
you know you would write them slightly

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.150 
you know you would write them slightly
closer<00:03:11.750> together<00:03:11.959> not<00:03:12.320> close<00:03:12.590> together<00:03:12.950> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
closer together not close together so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.040 
closer together not close together so
it's<00:03:13.310> not<00:03:13.459> readable<00:03:13.880> right<00:03:14.180> even<00:03:14.810> if<00:03:14.900> they're

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
it's not readable right even if they're

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.449 
it's not readable right even if they're
really<00:03:15.290> fast<00:03:15.740> right

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
really fast right

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.710 
really fast right
you<00:03:16.700> still<00:03:16.940> make<00:03:17.120> sure<00:03:17.270> that<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.510> very

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
you still make sure that it's very

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.090 
you still make sure that it's very
legible<00:03:17.990> but<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.530> would<00:03:18.650> write<00:03:18.830> those

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
legible but you would write those

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.100 
legible but you would write those
slightly<00:03:19.790> closer<00:03:20.150> together<00:03:20.390> than<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.900> would

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
slightly closer together than you would

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.870 
slightly closer together than you would
a<00:03:21.140> note<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:21.709> held<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> long<00:03:22.400> time

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
a note that's held for a long time

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.820 
a note that's held for a long time
just<00:03:23.269> visually<00:03:23.870> it'll<00:03:24.050> give<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.350> nicer

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
just visually it'll give you a nicer

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.229 
just visually it'll give you a nicer
reference<00:03:25.220> point<00:03:25.489> when<00:03:25.640> you're<00:03:25.790> writing<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
reference point when you're writing and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.910 
reference point when you're writing and
you'll<00:03:26.330> find<00:03:26.600> again<00:03:27.110> as<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.410> go<00:03:27.560> through<00:03:27.800> this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
you'll find again as you go through this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.860 
you'll find again as you go through this
course<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.459> give<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> rhythm<00:03:29.360> at<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.660> top

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
course I give you the rhythm at the top

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.940 
course I give you the rhythm at the top
and<00:03:30.050> you're<00:03:30.140> going<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.350> write<00:03:30.500> your<00:03:30.530> tab

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
and you're going to write your tab

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.979 
and you're going to write your tab
underneath<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.820> kind<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.360> give<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.660> feel

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
underneath so kind of give you a feel

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.960 
underneath so kind of give you a feel
for<00:03:33.050> doing<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.739> know<00:03:33.950> how<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.459> space<00:03:34.790> it

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
for doing that you know how to space it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.100 
for doing that you know how to space it
out<00:03:35.090> most<00:03:35.360> at<00:03:35.720> least<00:03:35.780> that's<00:03:36.140> my<00:03:36.320> intention

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
out most at least that's my intention

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.290 
out most at least that's my intention
writing<00:03:39.110> rhythm<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.830> tab<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.790> really<00:03:41.150> good

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
writing rhythm on tab is a really good

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
writing rhythm on tab is a really good
idea<00:03:41.390> that's<00:03:41.600> what<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.840> do<00:03:41.959> when<00:03:42.230> I'm

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
idea that's what I do when I'm

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.530 
idea that's what I do when I'm
transcribing<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:43.070> write<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.459> tab<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.300> write

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
transcribing I write in tab and I write

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.910 
transcribing I write in tab and I write
a<00:03:44.570> rhythm<00:03:44.959> above<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.440> don't<00:03:45.709> generally

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
a rhythm above it I don't generally

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.400 
a rhythm above it I don't generally
write<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.580> notation<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.510> reason<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:47.989> tab

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
write in notation the reason is that tab

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.530 
write in notation the reason is that tab
tells<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.830> where<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.100> play<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.459> note<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:49.970> if<00:03:50.360> you

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
tells you where to play a note so if you

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.390 
tells you where to play a note so if you
see<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.989> top<00:03:51.200> space<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.830> traditional

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
see the top space in traditional

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.850 
see the top space in traditional
notation<00:03:52.549> like<00:03:53.060> dot<00:03:53.269> notation<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:54.320> top<00:03:54.560> space

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
notation like dot notation the top space

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.530 
notation like dot notation the top space
there<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.340> note<00:03:55.489> e<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:56.209> can<00:03:56.450> be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
there is the note e and that can be

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.449 
there is the note e and that can be
played<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> open<00:03:57.410> thinner<00:03:57.650> string<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
played as the open thinner string the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.009 
played as the open thinner string the
fifth<00:03:58.670> fret<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.209> second<00:03:59.750> string<00:03:59.780> the

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
fifth fret of the second string the

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.080 
fifth fret of the second string the
ninth<00:04:00.320> fret<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.830> third<00:04:01.100> string<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.580> 14th

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
ninth fret of the third string the 14th

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.509 
ninth fret of the third string the 14th
fret<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.630> fourth<00:04:03.530> string<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.010> nineteenth

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
fret of the fourth string the nineteenth

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.250 
fret of the fourth string the nineteenth
fret<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:04.970> fifth<00:04:05.239> string<00:04:05.299> of<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.600> 24th<00:04:06.080> if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
fret of the fifth string of the 24th if

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
fret of the fifth string of the 24th if
you've<00:04:06.350> got<00:04:06.440> 24<00:04:06.799> frets<00:04:07.070> of<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.310> thickest

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
you've got 24 frets of the thickest

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.729 
you've got 24 frets of the thickest
string<00:04:07.640> it's<00:04:08.239> all<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.540> same<00:04:08.750> note<00:04:08.989> not<00:04:09.500> very

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
string it's all the same note not very

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.620 
string it's all the same note not very
helpful<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.459> think<00:04:10.549> tab<00:04:10.910> is<00:04:11.090> better<00:04:11.330> in<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
helpful so I think tab is better in that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.960 
helpful so I think tab is better in that
respect<00:04:12.049> but<00:04:12.530> tab<00:04:12.799> by<00:04:13.160> itself<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.640> missing

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
respect but tab by itself is missing

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.000 
respect but tab by itself is missing
rhythm<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.959> later<00:04:15.350> in<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> course<00:04:15.799> again

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
rhythm so later in the course again

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.710 
rhythm so later in the course again
we're<00:04:16.220> going<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.370> be<00:04:16.489> looking<00:04:16.729> at<00:04:16.850> learning<00:04:17.450> to

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
we're going to be looking at learning to

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.870 
we're going to be looking at learning to
write<00:04:17.989> rhythm<00:04:18.560> as<00:04:18.739> well<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.580> that<00:04:19.760> you're

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
write rhythm as well so that you're

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.190 
write rhythm as well so that you're
going<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.030> write<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.269> tab<00:04:20.630> first<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.109> then

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
going to write the tab first and then

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.020 
going to write the tab first and then
you're<00:04:21.320> going<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.530> write<00:04:21.709> rhythm<00:04:22.130> slashes<00:04:22.669> on

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
you're going to write rhythm slashes on

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.120 
you're going to write rhythm slashes on
to<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.510> tab<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.229> you've<00:04:24.410> got<00:04:24.620> actually<00:04:24.979> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
to the tab so you've got actually the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.800 
to the tab so you've got actually the
whole<00:04:25.340> picture<00:04:25.580> then<00:04:25.910> it's<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.120> really<00:04:26.539> great

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
whole picture then it's a really great

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.170 
whole picture then it's a really great
way<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.440> writing<00:04:28.160> your<00:04:28.370> transcriptions<00:04:29.000> down

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180
