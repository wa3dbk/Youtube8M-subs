00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hello everyone today we will learn 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.549
 how to release run in windows 7 windows 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
 vista servers 2003 2008 and windows xp 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.170
 but how useful is this well for the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.760
 utility that you can have is imagine 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.280
 in your company you have opened a 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.560
 server for two weeks or in your 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.030
 house a computer for four days and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.190
 suddenly you came up with the idea of 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.150
 open an application another application more 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.129
 does not have for example a photoshop or 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.410
 autocad and the computer 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.690
 It starts to go slow because it starts to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.969
 go slow because all those applications 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.789
 that you have been previously opened the 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.649
 system in the keep drum once it 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.170
 they open but once they always close 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.879
 they leave remains in rne 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.460
 then to erase those remains and that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 the run is completely clean and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.600
 winning performance that is greater 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.249
 because we are going to do is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.690
 create a script is worth for those 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.609
 computers that I open more than 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.969
 four or five days was going to release 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.330
 completely the ram is as if they did 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.240
 a load on good ram that's 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.979
 really that what they do 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 create a script that creates a load on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.270
 ram memory and leave all that space that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 we tell you free again well 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.520
 for example for windows 7 windows vista 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.260
 or servers 2003-2008 the script would be 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.160
 this then you open a not for you 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.630
 here and with the cold smells me speis the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.100
 desired quantity I think this 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 amount that the position is quite 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.560
 ok and then arias with the extension vbs 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.420
 for windows xp is also valid but for 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.820
 where it is believed would be more trine equal to the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.950
 desired amount also be careful of 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.680
 do not click many times on the script 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.080
 because you can collapse the system 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.090
 how do you see when you click on the script 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.100
 believe that a process that is called w 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.100
 script point s if I'm not wrong 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.860
 with the amount that will release and here 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.960
 it is also marking you 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.910
 the windows xp if I'm not wrong 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.760
 it also works on the windows in 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.060
 windows 7 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.110
 and nothing because this is mainly for 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.550
 those computers that are on 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.550
 long time until then
