00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.620
 more video in today's comparison 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.859
 let's look at the game performance 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 some graphics cards in the price range of 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.830
 180 to 400 euros on in this test 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 kick the poor dr 9 280 r 9 280 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.730
 iks nvidia gtx 770 and gtx 780 at the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.300
 Contemplation of the architectural 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.350
 eckdaten falls immediately on the gtx 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 770 is in this comparison the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.400
 weakest card 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 at least on paper the gtx 770 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.790
 owns the smallest memory the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 least number of shaders and that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 smallest memory interface which 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.680
 impact this has on performance 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.280
 Let's take a closer look now 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.280
 Let's go 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.660
 the test results show that the gtx 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.540
 770 despite their supposed 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.190
 worse equipment of the gtx 780 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.150
 comes dangerously close to 9 280 ickx and gtx 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.890
 770 are on one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 performance level despite different 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.940
 Overall, the performance for 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 current games more than out to this 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.350
 before de to be able to represent the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.030
 smallest and cheapest card r 9 280 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.620
 offers exactly the power you get in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.540
 can expect their performance 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 which map it should be now is you 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.220
 let me personally like the r 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.160
 9 280 e qss although this card is cheaper 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 As the GTX 770 is the performance 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.060
 almost identical that 's it then 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.800
 again, the video has fallen 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.050
 then, as always, I would go over one 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.650
 positive feedback look forward to the days 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.650
 pure skin
