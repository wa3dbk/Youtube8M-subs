00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the advent of lithium polymer has really

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
the advent of lithium polymer has really
given<00:00:28.859> us<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.130> battery<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.029> in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
given us a battery that we can use in

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.370 
given us a battery that we can use in
these<00:00:30.599> models<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.199> great

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
these models and get great

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.870 
these models and get great
power-to-weight<00:00:31.769> ratios<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.489> never<00:00:32.669> had

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
power-to-weight ratios that we never had

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360 
power-to-weight ratios that we never had
in<00:00:33.030> gas<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.420> glow<00:00:33.600> before<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.710> helicopter<00:00:35.219> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
in gas or glow before the helicopter we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.700 
in gas or glow before the helicopter we
have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> transmitter<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.690> using<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.140> 2.4

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
have a transmitter we're using the 2.4

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
have a transmitter we're using the 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:37.770> band<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.700> instead<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> 72

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
gigahertz band now instead of 72

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
gigahertz band now instead of 72
megahertz<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.230> basically<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.770> minimal<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
megahertz we basically have minimal to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
megahertz we basically have minimal to
zero<00:00:42.000> interference<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
zero interference at all we have the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
zero interference at all we have the
ability<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> turn<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> transmitter<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
ability to turn on the transmitter and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.880 
ability to turn on the transmitter and
it<00:00:45.539> finds<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.870> open<00:00:46.110> channel<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> its<00:00:46.620> own<00:00:46.739> we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it finds an open channel on its own we

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
it finds an open channel on its own we
don't<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.370> frequency<00:00:47.700> boards<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
don't have to use frequency boards it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.479 
don't have to use frequency boards it's
an<00:00:48.329> excellent<00:00:48.690> technology<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.890> particular

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
an excellent technology this particular

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.330 
an excellent technology this particular
transmitter<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.750> has<00:00:51.899> six<00:00:52.199> channels<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
transmitter actually has six channels so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.709 
transmitter actually has six channels so
we're<00:00:53.430> outputting<00:00:53.789> six<00:00:54.030> different<00:00:54.329> functions

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
we're outputting six different functions

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
we're outputting six different functions
at<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:56.039> computer<00:00:56.699> programmable

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
at one time it's computer programmable

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.049 
at one time it's computer programmable
which<00:00:57.420> means<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.780> adjust<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.469> small

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
which means we can adjust very small

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.130 
which means we can adjust very small
adjustments<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> servos<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.750> things

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
adjustments to the servos and things

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
adjustments to the servos and things
without<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:02.250> having<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> adjust

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
without actually having to adjust

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.830 
without actually having to adjust
linkages<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
linkages we can do it all in the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.729 
linkages we can do it all in the
transmitter<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.530> powerful

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
transmitter it's very powerful

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
transmitter it's very powerful
transmitter<00:01:05.369> nice<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
transmitter nice thing is this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
transmitter nice thing is this
particular<00:01:06.900> transmitter<00:01:07.290> has<00:01:07.439> 10<00:01:07.619> model

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
particular transmitter has 10 model

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.960 
particular transmitter has 10 model
memory<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> buy<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
memory so when you buy it with the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
memory so when you buy it with the
helicopter<00:01:09.510> even<00:01:09.990> though<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.409> one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
helicopter even though you have this one

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200 
helicopter even though you have this one
model<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> may<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.610> models<00:01:11.909> later<00:01:12.060> on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
model you may have more models later on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
model you may have more models later on
you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> same<00:01:12.810> transmitter<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you can use the same transmitter so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
you can use the same transmitter so
we've<00:01:14.250> got<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.549> control<00:01:14.850> sticks<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we've got to control sticks here this is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
we've got to control sticks here this is
what<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.259> call<00:01:16.439> mode<00:01:16.680> 2<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.220> four

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
what we call mode 2 there's four

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
what we call mode 2 there's four
different<00:01:17.520> modes<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> US<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
different modes but in the US we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
different modes but in the US we
primarily<00:01:19.020> fly<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> throttle<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
primarily fly with the throttle and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
primarily fly with the throttle and
collective<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> left<00:01:21.210> hand<00:01:21.360> stick<00:01:21.659> which

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
collective on the left hand stick which

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
collective on the left hand stick which
is<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> rudder<00:01:24.150> yaw<00:01:24.450> control

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
is here we have the rudder yaw control

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.649 
is here we have the rudder yaw control
here<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.460> Laran<00:01:26.729> roll<00:01:26.970> control<00:01:27.299> here

and we have elevator pitch control here

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.969 
and we have elevator pitch control here
although<00:01:30.869> I've<00:01:30.990> only<00:01:31.079> talked<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.680> four<00:01:31.950> or

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
although I've only talked about four or

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
although I've only talked about four or
five<00:01:32.130> functions<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.909> throttle<00:01:33.240> and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
basically doing the job that one server

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.530 
basically doing the job that one server
did<00:05:14.340> before<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.910> can<00:05:15.000> see<00:05:15.150> when<00:05:15.270> i<00:05:15.300> move

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
did before so you can see when i move

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.180 
did before so you can see when i move
the<00:05:15.690> collective<00:05:16.110> pitch<00:05:16.290> we<00:05:16.800> have<00:05:16.919> three

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the collective pitch we have three

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.130 
the collective pitch we have three
servos<00:05:17.640> moving<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.150> swash<00:05:18.360> plate<00:05:18.540> up<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:18.990> down

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
servos moving a swash plate up and down

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.180 
servos moving a swash plate up and down
at<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.820> same<00:05:20.970> time<00:05:21.350> it's<00:05:22.350> very<00:05:22.590> powerful<00:05:23.070> very

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
at the same time it's very powerful very

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.130 
at the same time it's very powerful very
precise<00:05:23.550> control<00:05:23.970> we<00:05:24.450> have<00:05:24.480> two<00:05:24.720> servos<00:05:25.080> and

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
precise control we have two servos and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.050 
precise control we have two servos and
roll<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.680> we<00:05:26.100> have<00:05:26.190> three<00:05:26.400> servos<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:26.730> pitch

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
roll and we have three servos and pitch

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.090 
roll and we have three servos and pitch
it<00:05:27.930> allows<00:05:28.200> us<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.530> remove<00:05:28.770> some<00:05:28.980> of<00:05:29.010> the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
it allows us to remove some of the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.469 
it allows us to remove some of the
mixing<00:05:29.460> levers<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:29.940> things<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.180> we<00:05:30.240> had<00:05:30.390> to

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
mixing levers and things that we had to

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.060 
mixing levers and things that we had to
use<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.810> past<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.229> also<00:05:31.500> allows<00:05:31.740> us<00:05:31.950> to

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
use in the past it also allows us to

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.500 
use in the past it also allows us to
double<00:05:32.310> up<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.580> triple<00:05:32.850> up<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.120> power<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.479> the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
double up and triple up the power of the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.870 
double up and triple up the power of the
servos<00:05:33.960> we<00:05:34.470> have<00:05:34.560> complicated<00:05:35.100> software<00:05:35.460> in

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
servos we have complicated software in

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.520 
servos we have complicated software in
the<00:05:35.910> transmitter<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.780> compensate<00:05:37.320> for<00:05:37.500> that

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the transmitter to compensate for that

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.800 
the transmitter to compensate for that
and<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:38.130> keep<00:05:38.340> any<00:05:38.550> interactions<00:05:39.360> as<00:05:39.479> minimal

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
and to keep any interactions as minimal

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.900 
and to keep any interactions as minimal
as<00:05:39.840> possible<00:05:40.070> we're<00:05:41.070> very<00:05:41.100> impressed<00:05:41.400> by<00:05:41.669> what

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
as possible we're very impressed by what

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.760 
as possible we're very impressed by what
we<00:05:42.030> see<00:05:42.210> here<00:05:42.419> but<00:05:43.020> let's<00:05:43.200> go<00:05:43.320> see<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.590> fly

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
we see here but let's go see it fly

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.330 
we see here but let's go see it fly
excellent<00:05:44.550> let's<00:05:44.669> go<00:05:44.790> over<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.060> see<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.150> fly
