00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 everyone knows how good it is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.639
 find for a small video a small 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.130
 quick ad video with screeds 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello lighthouses is so just for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.190
 tell you so for the hobbyists 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170
 folder it's here I created our 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.029
 team in fact with the screeds so that's okay 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.619
 to be a team a bit we'll say we're going 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 try to make a nice team 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 with a good atmosphere and all that so 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.939
 for those who would be interested in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.740
 join our team 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 I made a post on the forum of this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 try so of course you if you play 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 also you are registered on forum and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 you have friends some posts 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.050
 or not, but it's not very 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 important that and you had to stream 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 stone lambert movies I got 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.800
 place in the post 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.500
 to be able to enter the team 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 and I think I'm pretty much everything 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.469
 so good at wholesale it takes a few clicks 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 I think it's 5000 the limit to have 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.730
 some experience not having 8 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 years old either the fact of nice especially 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 it's the atmosphere before everything 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 blow not everything you can all have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 participated in the girls the boys all 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 the world there is no there is no 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.539
 difference 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 you can post meybon fo put a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.900
 minimum number of kylie if you do not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 not the minimum number of leaves that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 5000 must be able because frankly 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 I do not think that pure it will depend on the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.409
 number of wholesale requests and I 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 would lower - there will be demand and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.400
 more I would lower the number of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 kills needed to get in here's in 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.460
 knowing also that I favor self-help 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 old magpies in the team because 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 it's a lot more convenient per cent 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.619
 to play together on servers etc 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.909
 even if one is not old picon to a 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.030
 number of kills has no problem 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 both are finally that also allows for 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 sorting because someone who has 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 fired then it's someone who already wants 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 who is generous here that plays on the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.329
 servers that invested on the servers 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 to taunt because it's true it's 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.509
 if you bought the vip it's that you 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.579
 plan to play anyway 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.659
 so that's me it will be gently his 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.000
 course in very small video ads 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 but read it in the description I 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
 think of his farm with a lot to put 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.020

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.580
 refuse staff to tim coalisation 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 miles 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.790
 these traits of the house is because 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 we really want to take that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.180
 best universities to do the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.070
 best team in the French ctc and yeah 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
