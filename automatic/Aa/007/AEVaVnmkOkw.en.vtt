00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.270 

I'm<00:00:01.410> just<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.680> my<00:00:01.770> wall<00:00:01.920> bottom<00:00:02.159> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
I'm just a my wall bottom the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.590 
I'm just a my wall bottom the
three-for-three<00:00:02.730> system<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.149> good<00:00:03.330> for<00:00:03.510> us

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
three-for-three system is good for us

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.780 
three-for-three system is good for us
because<00:00:03.629> we're<00:00:04.110> used<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.470> having<00:00:04.620> 60<00:00:05.339> 70

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
because we're used to having 60 70

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.920 
because we're used to having 60 70
percent<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.150> possession<00:00:06.509> maybe

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
percent of possession maybe

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.379 
percent of possession maybe
and<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.379> we<00:00:07.529> win<00:00:07.890> even<00:00:08.160> more<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.820> midfield<00:00:08.970> you

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
and so we win even more in midfield you

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.990 
and so we win even more in midfield you
know<00:00:09.510> more<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> ball<00:00:10.910> superiority<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
know more to the ball superiority in the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.990 
know more to the ball superiority in the
mid<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> pitch<00:00:13.340> but<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.490> true<00:00:14.759> that's

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
mid of the pitch but is true that's

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
mid of the pitch but is true that's
going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> come<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> defending<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.320> find

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
going to come to defending we can find

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
going to come to defending we can find
it<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:16.680> harder<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.460> system<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
it a bit harder with this system in the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.689 
it a bit harder with this system in the
game<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> Wednesday<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.920> were<00:00:20.039> course<00:00:20.340> more<00:00:20.609> on

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
game on Wednesday we were course more on

game on Wednesday we were course more on
the<00:00:20.760> break<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.300> Lancia<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> great

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the break because the Lancia are a great

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.420 
the break because the Lancia are a great
team<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.380> they're<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.740> confident<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
team and they're very confident at the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
team and they're very confident at the
moment<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> second<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.140> forgot

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
moment but then in the second I forgot

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
moment but then in the second I forgot
things<00:00:25.619> sorted<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.880> went<00:00:26.970> back<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
things sorted out we went back to the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
things sorted out we went back to the
usual<00:00:27.810> system<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.529> more<00:00:28.890> used<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.519> we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
usual system when we more used to and we

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
usual system when we more used to and we
really<00:00:29.820> dominated<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> second<00:00:30.810> half<00:00:31.099> in<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
really dominated the second half in the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.360 
really dominated the second half in the
end<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:33.090> were<00:00:33.210> close<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> winning<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> game<00:00:34.079> in

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
end we were close to winning the game in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.770 
end we were close to winning the game in
fact<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> end<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.660> frustrating

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
fact in the end it was frustrating

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
fact in the end it was frustrating
because<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.620> feel<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> game<00:00:38.670> lasted

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
because we feel that if the game lasted

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
because we feel that if the game lasted
three<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.300> four<00:00:39.480> minutes<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.500> have

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
three or four minutes more we would have

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
three or four minutes more we would have
ended<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.890> winning<00:00:46.340> my<00:00:47.340> game<00:00:47.579> having<00:00:47.969> says
