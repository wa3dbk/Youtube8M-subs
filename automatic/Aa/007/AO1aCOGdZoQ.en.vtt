00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.470
 powerful toughbooks 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.470
 you can see that the pencil is the total area 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.999
 from the whole arm from top to bottom 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.329
 drawn 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.039
 not in motion 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.579
 withdrawn 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.579
 by Bernd pull the right yet turned 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.609
 what a set design will solve any problems 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.399
 Returns would be and Visconti 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.569
 Strokes could make you thicker Lammert called Gehrmann 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.060
 and that's where he's going 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 much more interesting 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 then write 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.960
 make things more interesting 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 Mines today used with a deep of pin wrestlers 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.720
 but we will be back at the same time 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.990
 they turn that interesting strokes spot 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.760
 and get in touch and the other and thicker 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.610
 so you can make different interesting strokes 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.079
 from which they can give already imposed short Tel 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.800
 or at least one 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.610
 interesting topic 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.980
 but always drawn to look frail 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.220
 in the palm and turned 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.180
 so we save understanding by swapping the webs dispel 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.230
 the cost will be 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.500
 7 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 press less 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.260
 we press 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.700
 Bremen 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 Turn 7 less 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.160
 press down less 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.610
 SID 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.010
 risky is the starting point for one 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.050
 because it can hardly be expected 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.200
 Here we are the branches from above 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870
 Want to attract customers 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 and also the coach want to go 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.619
 later we will also have watercolor with pen 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950
 Sanaria 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.640
 The fishermen can fly more into the scene 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
 again be treated here the community foundation 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.740
 embossed 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.990
 so I set the game to tell Sadik spare 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 Birger Tiemann a sharp edge 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.589
 and I can already here 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.589
 also decided 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 beautiful parliament has developed 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.559
 Reinforcement 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.599
 for reinforcement on a tree 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 well give prohibitions that is very good 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 and here I can also hang points for Pakistan 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.539
 then we'll look forward 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:43.439
 im emerge
