00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.300 
this is similar to them inserting glitch
but<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.290> how<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.470> make<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> lot<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.100> money

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
but this is how you make a lot of money

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.790 
but this is how you make a lot of money
because<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.450> use<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> tope<00:01:49.960> coke<00:01:50.560> quit

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
because you use the tope coke quit

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.340 
because you use the tope coke quit
topless<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:52.030> think<00:01:52.420> freight<00:01:52.960> train<00:01:53.200> was

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
topless and I think freight train was

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.139 
topless and I think freight train was
the<00:01:53.470> founder<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.220> original<00:01:54.670> version<00:01:55.090> of

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
the founder of the original version of

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.210 
the founder of the original version of
this<00:01:55.300> glitch<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.259> shout<00:01:56.470> out<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.890> freight

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
this glitch so shout out to you freight

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.340 
this glitch so shout out to you freight
train<00:01:57.430> but<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.149> found<00:01:58.810> out<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.110> way<00:01:59.290> it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
train but I found out this way it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.600 
train but I found out this way it's
easier<00:01:59.860> because<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.310> don't<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.520> to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
easier because you don't have to

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.010 
easier because you don't have to
teleport<00:02:00.880> into<00:02:01.270> your<00:02:01.390> rebel<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.720> just<00:02:01.899> get

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.060 
your friend to get in a big car like
that<00:02:04.000> Escalade<00:02:04.450> there<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:05.170> him<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.470> bash<00:02:05.710> into

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
that Escalade there get him to bash into

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.980 
that Escalade there get him to bash into
you<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.460> flame<00:02:06.729> goes<00:02:07.000> out<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:07.420> blocks<00:02:07.750> off
