you're<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> add<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:02.940> malt<00:01:03.329> extract

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you're going to add some malt extract

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.270 
you're going to add some malt extract
and<00:01:03.930> boil<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> add

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
in your hops and then at the end of that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.780 
in your hops and then at the end of that
when<00:01:07.320> you're<00:01:07.470> done<00:01:07.590> boiling<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
when you're done boiling you're going to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
when you're done boiling you're going to
cool<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.600> add<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.049> yeast<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
cool it down and add in your yeast and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
cool it down and add in your yeast and
this<00:01:10.799> usually<00:01:10.979> takes<00:01:11.340> between<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> three

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this usually takes between two to three

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.350 
this usually takes between two to three
hours<00:01:13.220> after<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> yeast<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.939> been<00:01:15.030> added

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
hours after the yeast have been added

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.469 
hours after the yeast have been added
your<00:01:15.600> wort<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.200> beer<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> yeast<00:01:18.090> will

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
your wort is now beer and the yeast will

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
your wort is now beer and the yeast will
start<00:01:18.509> fermenting<00:01:18.720> away<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.710> three<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
start fermenting away for about three to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.710 
start fermenting away for about three to
seven<00:01:20.460> days<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.180> called<00:01:21.509> your

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
seven days and this is called your

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
seven days and this is called your
primary<00:01:21.869> fermentation<00:01:22.909> once<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> start

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
primary fermentation once you start

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
primary fermentation once you start
slowing<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.900> you're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> siphon<00:01:25.860> out

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
slowing down you're going to siphon out

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
slowing down you're going to siphon out
of<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.340> primary<00:01:26.460> vessel<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.780> secondary

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of your primary vessel into a secondary

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
of your primary vessel into a secondary
vessel<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.159> operation<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> called<00:01:30.090> racking

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
vessel this operation is called racking

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.410 
vessel this operation is called racking
and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> takes<00:01:30.990> roughly<00:01:31.229> thirty<00:01:31.740> minutes<00:01:32.420> once

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and it takes roughly thirty minutes once

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.700 
and it takes roughly thirty minutes once
you're<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.750> secondary<00:01:34.170> vessel<00:01:34.350> you're

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you're in your secondary vessel you're

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
you're in your secondary vessel you're
gonna<00:01:35.159> let<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.400> sit<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> finish<00:01:36.509> its

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
gonna let it sit and finish its

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
gonna let it sit and finish its
remaining<00:01:37.380> fermentation<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.310> left

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
remaining fermentation that it has left

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
remaining fermentation that it has left
and<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.270> take<00:01:39.630> usually<00:01:39.900> seven<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and this will take usually seven to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 
and this will take usually seven to
fourteen<00:01:41.159> days<00:01:41.299> at<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.600> point<00:01:42.930> most<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.560> your

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
fourteen days at this point most of your

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.080 
fourteen days at this point most of your
yeast<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.100> fallen<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> solution

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
yeast will have fallen out of solution

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.030 
yeast will have fallen out of solution
and<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:46.049> beer<00:01:46.079> will<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.439> getting<00:01:46.560> very<00:01:46.799> very
