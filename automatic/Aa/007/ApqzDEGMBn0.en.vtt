00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 at the beginning of the game as a «living planet» how are you 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.550
 "Yes, so far so good 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.220
 well prepared and 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.409
 I think that was the browser bissel oyster 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.989
 out of failure, the last word our teachings have drawn or those 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.499
 The player strands hit first tackled the lessons pulled as a coach 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.510
 but also a very very fast the customer was targeted 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.579
 but very very clear under Klaus Auer very big 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.439
 Portion of self-criticism in the individual players asked and 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.659
 We have to be on the whole is the norm, "said Thaler and Percent 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.410
 that no one was there but can claim that it worked 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.060
 then she figured she would do that too, assuming there is only one win 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.380
 Quarter better at the moment the Saalbacher has not always been that he 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.550
 They looked away for three days later, but just today 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 her tasks in front of a sold-out house for the home with the support 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.710
 or has that been a giant leap forward but only the main theme 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.760
 Under water, "necessary supply" of Baltic land was over 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.750
 the self-confidence impressed by Amiga many injuries are but exactly 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 say how I should play from the beginning fully on 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.840
 Who luggage should be aligned so that we want to tackle early 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.470
 early also with the new 3d me printer out so we want it as he does 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.079
 have heard of it before 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.869
 I hope the water was better occupied the Briton Kristan before the 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.869
 Veterans filtered from us now to the next phase 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.160
 higher than myself, it would be clear the target reached the situation especially 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.740
 but are generally required they are also able 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.470
 Carlo RPO has proved it every year for the past two years 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.580
 Thanks speeches dapd 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.510
 worry 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.670
 the lawn wet but okay that is the truth riparian all in white without the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.120
 locked 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 but by coach Ernst Middendorp 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.380
 put under steam 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.680
 Bielefeld played for six minutes 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 about Peter Quallo 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.290
 on Fritz Walter the first chance 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 the first goal 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 it is already 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.369
 first damper for the Skoda climb hopes but she responds 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.749
 the flying one 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.699
 even that operates back on the way up to now 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.349
 too broad strength shows the next title of the show from Bad Honnef 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.509
 Zi 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.860
 from e had to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.959
 The second bull certificate then existed 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.170
 the match was at highlights until the 45 minute after this Paul von Eckart 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.650
 Bomsdorf three-level tariff 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.809
 Goalkeeper Tom strong 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.999
 the compensation 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.819
 before the half time 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.959
 for the residents who are already thoughtful in the drought every 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.399
 bet 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.119
 Halftime on the Alb 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.599
 Storm and rain 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.000
 after the break then publicity events again a chance for 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 Bielefeld 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.349
 he challenged everyone after 2001 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.620
 a hit the timeless first the flank of 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.059
 Thomas von Heesen but he fails to belittle Holla part 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.039
 to the taste of the wearer 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.399
 from serious-peter 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.369
 three minutes later

 Pauli at free kick 20 meters goal removal 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 the compensation 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:20.939
 July is rising 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.139
 the 41-year-old keeper on the line paralyzed 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.319
 Dollars per share and at least to be able to 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.719
 Experian posts whatever the MSV feels 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.589
 Bitburger water 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.079
 Flank Bushman and again makes him 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.819
 had done well 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.939
 bundesliga experience 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.809
 Innsbruck can be 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:48.199
 the game in the second half with high entertainment value an open 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.919
 Exchange after 70 minutes 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.620
 Sentence with 11 points again 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.749
 the arminen Thomas Stratos 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.749
 Area clasped with the ball Walter Tacke 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.969
 the second goal in front 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.439
 Michael Molatta 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.379
 a man for the rough 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.959
 he shot the way we did 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.959
 towards the first league 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.469
 Foul an eleven-meter foul on next 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.469
 Boller Trade use the compensation 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.409
 of course adjourned again 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.729
 Peter too 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.960
 forgives the texts counter chance 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.219
 shortly thereafter it was over 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:30.639
 with a great game 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.639
 Ostwestfalen already celebrated 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.979
 Facebook is missing 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.020
 But who the result does not belong to you about the way we football 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.680
 wm-out have shown that neither position is just watching away percent 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.100
 Merkel and Obama have to accept it very much 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 No one wants to bring them home to Bergen 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.300
 Enlarge picture dpa 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.970
 the Briton is still missing people should hear about this 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.240
 Take self-confidence 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.249
 how it continues as before 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.249
 "Whoever wins the derby is currently raising 4 0 percent 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.930
 if Bayer for the Bielefeld today actually much more important 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.389
 they now have five points clear of the point on the city of Duisburg 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.729
 four points ahead Paulo listen again in Bielefeld at the coach 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:21.979
 Ernst Mittendorf 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.020
 as Minogue i hope to hear them and also now in Bielefeld 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020
 Stone fell from the heart today 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.770
 yes the percent is certainly right so far 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.930
 percent 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.229
 after failing except for the week in Mainz, of course we have one 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.120
 heavy week then knew what Otto game is 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.610
 Thank God they managed to get a grip on Dassow 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.069
 Today to deliver the game and then ultimately successful 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.550
 they work a bit hectic times like their own 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.900
 Team has won or deserve lucky 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.560
 well that's taken over percent she was certainly like that both 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.960
 Teams wanted her to succeed both teams wanted 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.550
 AZ might have an end 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.470
 Percent of the small rash given that it's light the slightly larger 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.330
 Victims will have percent off of the day and percent then believe 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.969
 you also deserved to have retained the three points 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.639
 the Thomas von Heesen just very carefully with the first perspective 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.680
 football bundesliga 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.960
 But now it is seriously expected that we next year 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.999
 be first class 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:21.009
 it is certainly staked that way 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.169
 In the course of the week, we've gotten out of the game for the percent they said 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.400
 Interpretation has made of course the percent to logical advantage in the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.590
 the remaining ones play the two points left to make but it is right where 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.229
 they will soon address the captain 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.620
 we must not fall into the error now of war and thus of 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.110
 Center by but percent believe there is a rude awakening so must 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.330
 do not do it but quite ambitious the first time 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.839
 to deal in the next bar and the next week in in Bochum and 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.589
 I'm assuming at the moment that we have the support here 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.399
 Percent bit again can take over in the end then there too 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.759
 ambitious and maybe even succeed at data step 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:55.619
 get ahead 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:59.159
 So long Ernst Middendorp we press them just as much as the Duisburgers 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.330
 Next week I'll be up to more 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.040
 Thank you too
