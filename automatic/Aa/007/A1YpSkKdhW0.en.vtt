00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
twenty-second which was my surgery day

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.139 
twenty-second which was my surgery day
way<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.930> 332<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.770> day<00:00:44.010> 317<00:00:44.940> today

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
way in so I was 332 that day 317 today

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.500 
way in so I was 332 that day 317 today
so<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.629> 15<00:00:46.050> pounds<00:00:46.500> lost<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.910> total<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so it's 15 pounds lost in a total of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
so it's 15 pounds lost in a total of
seven<00:00:49.200> full<00:00:49.440> days<00:00:49.500> since<00:00:50.340> today's<00:00:50.579> actually

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
seven full days since today's actually

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
seven full days since today's actually
the<00:00:51.120> eighth<00:00:51.300> day<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:54.600> exciting<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> then

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the eighth day so it's exciting and then

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.029 
the eighth day so it's exciting and then
total<00:00:56.550> I've<00:00:56.730> started<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.840> pre-op<00:00:58.469> wait<00:00:58.829> at

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
total I've started my pre-op wait at

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.910 
total I've started my pre-op wait at
three<00:00:59.550> 49th<00:01:00.180> pre-op<00:01:00.690> diet<00:01:00.719> weight<00:01:01.289> should<00:01:01.680> say

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
three 49th pre-op diet weight should say

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
three 49th pre-op diet weight should say
at<00:01:02.520> 349<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.719> was<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> sixteenth<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> June

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
at 349 that was on the sixteenth of June

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.880 
at 349 that was on the sixteenth of June
and<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> math<00:01:08.159> 349

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
and so you can do the math 349

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.789 
and so you can do the math 349
subtracting<00:01:10.890> 3<00:01:11.130> 17<00:01:11.840> makes<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> loss<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> 32

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
subtracting 3 17 makes a loss of 32

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.270 
subtracting 3 17 makes a loss of 32
pounds<00:01:14.010> total<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.689> weeks<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.290> day<00:01:16.380> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pounds total in two weeks to the day so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.870 
pounds total in two weeks to the day so
that's<00:01:17.670> awesome<00:01:19.430> probably<00:01:20.430> won't<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.670> able<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that's awesome probably won't be able to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
that's awesome probably won't be able to
keep<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.450> obviously<00:01:22.100> but<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.400> hope<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.820> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
keep that up obviously but I hope to be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.140 
keep that up obviously but I hope to be
able<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> levels<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
able to when it levels off and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.930 
able to when it levels off and
things<00:01:27.990> start<00:01:28.230> to<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:29.280> normal<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.850> I'm

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
things start to go pretty normal and I'm

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.370

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
maybe and that's it I mean maybe two

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.940 
maybe and that's it I mean maybe two
times<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:12.790> day<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.470> really<00:04:14.470> nothing<00:04:14.830> of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
times a day and really nothing of

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.610 
times a day and really nothing of
substance<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.989> probably<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.169> getting<00:04:17.440> enough

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
substance so probably not getting enough

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.629 
substance so probably not getting enough
in<00:04:17.829> me<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:20.650> know<00:04:20.769> we'll<00:04:21.130> see<00:04:21.160> hopefully

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
in me but you know we'll see hopefully

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.010 
in me but you know we'll see hopefully
that<00:04:21.940> will<00:04:22.000> change<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.540> next<00:04:22.600> couple<00:04:22.900> of
