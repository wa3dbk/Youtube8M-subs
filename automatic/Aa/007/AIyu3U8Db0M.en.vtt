00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
the description but yeah he actually

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.729 
the description but yeah he actually
said<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.299> he<00:04:19.690> liked<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.170> because<00:04:20.320> it's

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
said that he liked it because it's

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.600 
said that he liked it because it's
something<00:04:21.130> new<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.650> they<00:04:24.220> had<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.580> change

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
something new and and they had to change

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.990 
something new and and they had to change
it<00:04:25.120> i<00:04:25.210> guess<00:04:25.420> it<00:04:25.600> was<00:04:25.630> getting<00:04:25.930> old<00:04:26.140> but<00:04:26.950> odd<00:04:27.370> I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
it i guess it was getting old but odd I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.860 
it i guess it was getting old but odd I
mean<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.960> layout<00:04:29.380> itself<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:30.220> ok<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.810> just

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
mean the layout itself is ok but just

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.720 
mean the layout itself is ok but just
the<00:04:32.380> fact<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.830> they<00:04:33.040> change<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.490> rating

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
the fact that they change the rating

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.260 
the fact that they change the rating
system<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.650> ridiculously<00:04:36.030> retarded<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.120> my

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
system is ridiculously retarded in my

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.240 
system is ridiculously retarded in my
opinion<00:04:37.600> because<00:04:37.870> everybody<00:04:38.530> like<00:04:38.980> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
opinion because everybody like the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.220 
opinion because everybody like the
rating<00:04:39.700> system<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.720> since

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
rating system and and you know since

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.470 
rating system and and you know since
they<00:04:44.380> changed<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.310> don't<00:04:46.030> know<00:04:46.240> how<00:04:46.450> many

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480
