00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
grills in there I'm probably getting a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.460 
grills in there I'm probably getting a
plasti<00:00:24.570> dip<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.019> you're<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.230> them<00:00:25.350> oh<00:00:25.410> if

plasti dip and you're on them oh if

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
plasti dip and you're on them oh if
there's<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> point<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.150> gray

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
there's really a point it's kind of gray

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.509 
there's really a point it's kind of gray
but<00:00:27.689> black<00:00:28.650> might<00:00:28.890> bring<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> little

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
but black might bring it out a little

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.550 
but black might bring it out a little
better

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
better

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.870 
better
if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> take<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.579> out

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
if you want to know how to take this out

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.690 
if you want to know how to take this out
it's<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.870> pretty<00:00:34.800> simple<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
it's actually pretty simple it's a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's actually pretty simple it's a
little<00:00:35.880> probably<00:00:36.719> took<00:00:36.930> me<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.230> 15<00:00:37.559> minutes

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
little probably took me about 15 minutes

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
little probably took me about 15 minutes
a<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:37.950> time-consuming<00:00:38.250> blood<00:00:38.910> easy<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a little time-consuming blood easy I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
a little time-consuming blood easy I
just<00:00:39.930> marked<00:00:40.320> top<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> bottom<00:00:41.489> watch<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just marked top and bottom watch so I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.950 
just marked top and bottom watch so I
know<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.570> mean<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.160> hole<00:00:44.399> here

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
know I mean there's there's a hole here

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
know I mean there's there's a hole here
and<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> lines<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.770> hole<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.450> on

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and it lines up with the hole on the on

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.069 
and it lines up with the hole on the on
the<00:00:48.570> grill<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:50.210> for<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> logo<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.870> mean

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the grill put up for the logo so I mean

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
the grill put up for the logo so I mean
it's<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.289> hard<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> screw<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it's really hard to screw this up but so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.170 
it's really hard to screw this up but so
it<00:00:55.110> would<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.789> deck<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.800> this

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
it would go like this deck like this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.430 
it would go like this deck like this
sits<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.320> see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sits in there like that and you can see

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.910 
sits in there like that and you can see
all<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.920> tiny<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.340> tabs<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.680> got

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
all these tiny little tabs and they got

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.910 
all these tiny little tabs and they got
two<00:01:05.220> sides<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:07.080> can't<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
two sides to them like I can't see it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
two sides to them like I can't see it
but<00:01:08.070> there's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> lip<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> goes<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.689> top<00:01:09.840> of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
but there's a lip that goes over top of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.240 
but there's a lip that goes over top of
this<00:01:10.140> piece<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> plastic<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.890> lip<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> goes

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this piece of plastic and lip that goes

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.149 
this piece of plastic and lip that goes
over<00:01:11.520> top<00:01:11.640> piece<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> plastic<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.830> best

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
over top piece of plastic on the best

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
over top piece of plastic on the best
way<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.110> take<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:17.369> simple<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
way to take it out which was simple is I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219 
way to take it out which was simple is I
would<00:01:19.740> take<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.060> mini<00:01:21.229> flat

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
would take I have a little mini flat

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
would take I have a little mini flat
plate<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> another<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.880> mini<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
plate and another little mini one this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
plate and another little mini one this
one's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> bit<00:01:24.750> bigger<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.049> same<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
one's a bit bigger but same thing so I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
one's a bit bigger but same thing so I
would<00:01:26.880> take<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.299> went<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> best<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.920> take<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
would take it went the best so take it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
would take it went the best so take it
and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.119> pry<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and then I would pry up on that but I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
and then I would pry up on that but I
would<00:01:31.829> start<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.360> work<00:01:33.479> my

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
would start over here and then work my

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.319 
would start over here and then work my
way<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.840> top<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.009> work<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.189> way<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:36.150> way

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
way on top and then work my way that way

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060 
way on top and then work my way that way
again<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> wanna<00:01:37.619> keep<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
again and then down I wanna keep going

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
again and then down I wanna keep going
and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:38.909> slowly<00:01:39.210> push<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> note

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and I would slowly push it out a note

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
and I would slowly push it out a note
and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.860> take<00:01:40.950> both<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.939> at

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and then I would take both of them at

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.530 
and then I would take both of them at
once

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
once

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.069 
once
and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.710> pry<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> then

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and I would pry this one over and then

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
and I would pry this one over and then
this<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.409> over<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.430> would<00:01:47.549> stick<00:01:48.000> my

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
this one over and then I would stick my

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160
