00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.889
 I want to start this video today. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 thanking everyone for the love and the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.389
 and all of you who are 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.330
 subscribing to my channel is very 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.779
 Thank you and I know you're being very 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.449
 These classes of flowers are useful and today 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.390
 we'll start with another flower that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.970
 it's a clove 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 this arrangement 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 I chose this bottom because 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.050
 it was an arrangement that I had then I said 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 I will value it now with our 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 paper flowers crepe because suddenly 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 You have a nice pot there and you do not have 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.260
 problem you can work with 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.860
 paper flowers that you will treasure 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 in the same way as an artificial flower and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.780
 It's also easy because you want it already 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.079
 knows that our material is just the paper 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.870
 crepe in the wire case here I worked 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.299
 with the wire and the priest had to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.040
 barbecue and I'll do the little bit 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 on account of that firmness 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 We are going to take the paper size is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.200
 according to the size of the flower you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 You will want to use I'll cut this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 piece here then with that little bit 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:37.799
 here we are going to open here more or less 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.439
 but come from the other side and also 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.990
 Let's go down there and do it. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.930
 very thin strips 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.869
 You'll need a gritty scissors. 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.829
 do not chew and that kind of flower qa 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.530
 that crepe paper thinner and goes 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.159
 It's still better to work, I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.619
 I did not find the cut of the flower, let's go. 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.659
 make a mess in it here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.440
 because I'm going to need to open 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.440
 this role then we open the role 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:23.799
 No problem, because we're going to double. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:29.040
 again, then we'll do more or 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:38.379
 less this measure here and we will record 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:50.579
 fitting back to this calls if 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:50.579
 get up and play like this 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:05.100
 Now we're going to get a little toothpick for 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.930
 that takes off touch and we will not need 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.070
 hit that little catch 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.140
 we're only going to roll the adjusting 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:22.550
 right down here 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:30.620
 Let's go rolling. Let's go rolling. 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.620
 a little piece of our own 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:54.450
 the firm will smell here looks good is just 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.670
 so then we notice 8 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.530
 things that happen unexpectedly that 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.510
 it's worth the taag that I put 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.019
 Little glue but no problem 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.090
 not 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.489
 so here I am seeing that she is 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.239
 certinha 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.760
 we will cast off 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.350
 let's ride our little flower you 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.019
 looking sideways 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.489
 Do you feel the full edge of it? 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.370
 is going to get it right that if a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.790
 same thing when you look you feel 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:32.960
 who has tip then got pulled in 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.960
 yes, a very delicate thing 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.910
 I come here to finish if you 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.890
 want to use the critical green moss paper 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.740
 You can use it too, I do not 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:52.310
 I found green do not listen to who 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.310
 paste 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:20.950
 Look small and you're gone. 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:23.230
 of your child s is the touch of the ball too 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.970
 ended 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.490
 I finished here 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.360
 if you think she still has some 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:44.180
 well, she's going to stay 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:50.330
 proportional to the top is here I 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:53.270
 I have with wire that movement that 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.880
 I always tell you if I need to 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.150
 which would have ceased here if you 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.810
 Wherever you want, but here, what have I done? 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.330
 now I'm going to fit in is that so good that 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.060
 she will be part of our arrangement 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.930
 So I can go down a little bit further. 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.690
 Look how valuable this was to jac 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.540
 Artificial as well but you can be 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.180
 creating can use the acoustic wire a 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.610
 No more open base, no problem. 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.370
 also people I did this quiet little voice 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.410
 pink to show you that she 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.070
 It is beautiful in any key is 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.180
 Seeing this here is a bottle of those 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.990
 discarded that we meet with 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.820
 Water 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.830
 Look how beautiful it will look too. 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.740
 flower here you can be 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:43.610
 placing a bond and creating and 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.730
 other other bottles you will 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.570
 Being able to use it too I hope 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.980
 that this wheel made a useful lesson and 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.500
 I'm very happy for you to be there. 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.250
 sharing I thank you from the heart 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.250
