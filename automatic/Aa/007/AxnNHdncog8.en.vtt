00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
windows actually the quest is the 4th

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.650 
windows actually the quest is the 4th
bar<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.350> had<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.560> hit<00:04:26.650> 4<00:04:26.949> eventually

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660

couldn't<00:04:28.660> go<00:04:28.720> through<00:04:28.840> every<00:04:29.050> option<00:04:29.169> until<00:04:29.590> I

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
couldn't go through every option until I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.439 
couldn't go through every option until I
get<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.830> there<00:04:29.979> though

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.239 

I<00:04:37.509> think<00:04:38.110> we're<00:04:38.499> out<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.650> options<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.069> have<00:04:39.189> to

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
I think we're out of options I have to

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.999 
I think we're out of options I have to
go<00:04:39.340> do<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:39.639> one<00:04:40.680> Eric<00:04:41.680> I'm<00:04:41.770> not<00:04:41.860> gonna

go do this one Eric I'm not gonna
request

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.790 

whoo<00:04:47.600> all<00:04:48.600> right<00:04:48.720> i'ma<00:04:48.960> go<00:04:49.050> explore<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.380> didn't

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
whoo all right i'ma go explore I didn't

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.670 
whoo all right i'ma go explore I didn't
figure<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.130> out<00:04:51.290> didn't<00:04:52.290> seem<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.470> be<00:04:52.530> able<00:04:52.590> to

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
figure it out didn't seem to be able to

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.960 
figure it out didn't seem to be able to
put<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:52.980> my<00:04:53.070> map<00:04:53.250> -<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.490> figured<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.850> was

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
put up with my map - I figured it was

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.220 
put up with my map - I figured it was
like<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> little<00:04:54.150> checkpoint<00:04:54.450> set<00:04:54.900> out<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
like a little checkpoint set out and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.020 
like a little checkpoint set out and
track<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.620> for<00:04:55.800> me<00:04:55.920> but<00:04:56.160> couldn't<00:04:56.850> do<00:04:56.910> that

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
track it for me but couldn't do that

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.360 
track it for me but couldn't do that
either<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.890> maybe<00:04:58.890> there's<00:04:59.040> an<00:04:59.130> option

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
either so maybe there's an option

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.770 
either so maybe there's an option
somewhere<00:04:59.670> I<00:04:59.700> don't<00:04:59.790> know<00:04:59.940> where<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.210> yet

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
you get hung up on something then just

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.480 
you get hung up on something then just
ya<00:05:18.270> go<00:05:18.390> backwards<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.800> I'm<00:05:20.070> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
ya go backwards like that that I'm the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.970 

that's<00:05:50.750> like<00:05:50.870> interesting<00:05:51.350> and<00:05:51.470> coming<00:05:51.680> ahead

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
that's like interesting and coming ahead

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.700 
that's like interesting and coming ahead
looks<00:05:52.190> like<00:05:52.370> towards<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:52.820> right<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:57.530> game

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
looks like towards the right this game

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.930 
looks like towards the right this game
does<00:05:57.860> have<00:05:57.890> a<00:05:58.040> level<00:05:58.400> progression<00:05:58.790> system

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
does have a level progression system

does have a level progression system
rather<00:05:59.180> than<00:05:59.270> skill<00:05:59.960> points<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.260> game<00:06:00.410> like

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
rather than skill points a game like

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.530 
rather than skill points a game like
Ultima<00:06:00.890> Online<00:06:00.920> would<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.180> probably

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
Ultima Online would so that probably

means as you gain levels you increase

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.050 
means as you gain levels you increase
your<00:06:05.240> hip<00:06:05.390> points<00:06:05.540> look<00:06:05.990> at<00:06:06.110> your<00:06:06.260> damage

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
your hip points look at your damage

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.310 
your hip points look at your damage
wouldn't<00:06:08.060> be<00:06:08.120> surprised<00:06:08.570> if<00:06:08.810> it<00:06:08.930> makes<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.140> so

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
wouldn't be surprised if it makes it so

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.770 
wouldn't be surprised if it makes it so
you<00:06:09.380> hit<00:06:10.070> lower<00:06:10.550> level<00:06:10.880> guys<00:06:11.090> for<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.390> lot<00:06:11.570> more
