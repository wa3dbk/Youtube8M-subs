this<00:00:34.440> particular<00:00:34.649> unit<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.520> quite<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> bit

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this particular unit this is quite a bit

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
this particular unit this is quite a bit
because<00:00:36.719> alien<00:00:37.380> where's<00:00:37.620> built<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
because alien where's built this up as a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
because alien where's built this up as a
gaming<00:00:38.760> system<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.450> there's<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> 1200<00:00:40.710> watt

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

graphics<00:00:48.690> card<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.829> processors<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.270> one

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
graphics card so our processors just one

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
graphics card so our processors just one
yeah<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
yeah just one just one it's like can

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
yeah just one just one it's like can
hinder<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> tow<00:00:53.940> yeah<00:00:54.120> yeah<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> we're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
hinder the tow yeah yeah and we're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.020 
hinder the tow yeah yeah and we're
capturing<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.940> 1080p<00:00:57.360> streams<00:00:57.899> real<00:00:58.170> time

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
capturing to to 1080p streams real time

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.580 
capturing to to 1080p streams real time
we<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> capture<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:00.960> soon<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.379> stop

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we do the capture and as soon as we stop

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.170 
we do the capture and as soon as we stop
the<00:01:01.770> capture<00:01:02.129> we've<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> QuickTime<00:01:02.940> file

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the capture we've got a QuickTime file

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:16.110 
the capture we've got a QuickTime file
so<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.530> immediately<00:01:04.710> click

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.870 

what<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.890> linds<00:01:20.890> ticular<00:01:21.250> technology

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
what is that is linds ticular technology

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.210 
what is that is linds ticular technology
lens<00:01:22.600> take<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.990> wreck<00:01:23.110> technology<00:01:23.650> if<00:01:23.740> OMG

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
lens take the wreck technology if OMG

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.090 
lens take the wreck technology if OMG
cakes<00:01:24.550> I<00:01:25.180> know<00:01:25.450> actually<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.870> audio<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.410> Leo<00:01:26.740> stop

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
cakes I know actually I audio a Leo stop

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.220 
cakes I know actually I audio a Leo stop
is<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> company<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:27.910> makes<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.020> um

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
is the company that makes that it's um

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.000 
is the company that makes that it's um
it's<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:30.010> notice<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.370> screen<00:01:30.820> them

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
it's a notice to screen them

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.520 
it's a notice to screen them
you<00:01:34.010> can<00:01:34.190> expend<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:35.030> can<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.320> basically

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
you can expend you can so it's basically

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.680 
you can expend you can so it's basically
it's<00:01:36.980> Lynch<00:01:37.460> ticular<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.090> there's<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.390> series

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's Lynch ticular so there's a series

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.690 
it's Lynch ticular so there's a series
of<00:01:38.750> small<00:01:39.110> lenses<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.680> line<00:01:39.920> up<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
of small lenses that line up with the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.610 
of small lenses that line up with the
sub-pixels<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.660> on<00:01:41.780> your<00:01:41.930> television<00:01:42.170> set

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
sub-pixels on the on your television set

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.130 
sub-pixels on the on your television set
the<00:01:43.250> content<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.850> actually<00:01:44.210> created<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:44.810> 3d

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
the content is actually created in 3d

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.960 
the content is actually created in 3d
and<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:45.530> divided<00:01:45.950> up<00:01:46.070> into<00:01:46.160> eight<00:01:46.430> cameras

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and it's divided up into eight cameras

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.180 
and it's divided up into eight cameras
and<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:48.140> that's<00:01:48.350> what<00:01:48.560> you're<00:01:48.680> like<00:01:48.950> there's

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and so that's what you're like there's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.610 
and so that's what you're like there's
eight<00:01:49.340> there's<00:01:49.370> basic<00:01:49.970> 18<00:01:50.380> winters<00:01:51.380> that

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
eight there's basic 18 winters that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.000 
eight there's basic 18 winters that
project<00:01:52.010> that<00:01:52.160> image<00:01:52.400> out<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.830> get<00:01:54.830> some

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
project that image out and then get some

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.090 
project that image out and then get some
coordinated<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.030> looks<00:01:56.180> 3d<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:57.950> that's

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
coordinated so it looks 3d but so that's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.490 
coordinated so it looks 3d but so that's
very<00:01:58.250> specialized<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.330> primarily<00:02:00.140> for

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
very specialized it's primarily for

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.400 
very specialized it's primarily for
digital<00:02:01.490> signage<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.150> attraction<00:02:03.140> signs

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
digital signage and attraction signs

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.040 
digital signage and attraction signs
like<00:02:03.650> this

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.130 

so<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:06.680> can<00:02:06.920> go<00:02:07.070> around<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.640> can<00:02:07.820> see<00:02:08.140> ya

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
so you can go around and you can see ya

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.330 
so you can go around and you can see ya
it's<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:11.720> no<00:02:11.900> no<00:02:12.170> no<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.620> was<00:02:13.190> just

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
it's not you no no no this was just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's not you no no no this was just
looping<00:02:13.700> conscious<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> pre-rendered

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
looping conscious it was a pre-rendered
