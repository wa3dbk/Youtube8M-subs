00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
that method is actually kind of hard to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
that method is actually kind of hard to
do<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> you've<00:00:25.050> often<00:00:25.320> fall<00:00:25.680> off<00:00:25.890> many<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
do and you've often fall off many of the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.650 
do and you've often fall off many of the
times<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.820> oh<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> come<00:00:27.449> over<00:00:27.480> here

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
times but oh if you come over here

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120 
times but oh if you come over here
there's<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> fence<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.949> knock

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
there's like a fence that you can knock

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.880 
there's like a fence that you can knock
down<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.349> easier<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
down and it's actually much easier to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
down and it's actually much easier to
stay<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.790> stand<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> what

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
stay on and if you just stand on it what

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.120 
stay on and if you just stand on it what
you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.860> ahead<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you can do is you can just go ahead and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.760 
you can do is you can just go ahead and
shoot<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.020> what<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.140> happen<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
shoot at it and what will happen is it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
shoot at it and what will happen is it
will<00:00:37.800> move<00:00:38.489> around<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> skateboard<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
what you have to do to do that is you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
what you have to do to do that is you
actually<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.629> shoot<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> fence<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

way over to the ocean which actually

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
way over to the ocean which actually
isn't<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> far<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.250> once<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> do

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
isn't really that far but once you do

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.340 
isn't really that far but once you do
get<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

can<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> continue<00:00:53.489> shooting<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
can do is you can continue shooting it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.080 
can do is you can continue shooting it
as<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> water<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.940> neat

you'll need the grenade launcher for
this<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.900> basically<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.680> go<00:02:21.800> up

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
this one and basically you have to go up

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.860 
this one and basically you have to go up
to<00:02:21.980> any<00:02:22.130> car<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.360> separately<00:02:23.690> start

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to any car and you separately start

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.630 
to any car and you separately start
hitting<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.680> grenade<00:02:25.070> launcher<00:02:25.460> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
hitting it with the grenade launcher and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.930 
hitting it with the grenade launcher and
it<00:02:25.700> should<00:02:25.940> take<00:02:26.240> three<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.110> six<00:02:27.410> hits

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
it should take three to six hits

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.640 
it should take three to six hits
depending<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> car<00:02:29.330> size<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.170> actually

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
depending on the car size to actually

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
depending on the car size to actually
blow<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> up<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.460> car<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.970> takes<00:02:32.300> around

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
blow it up a car like this takes around

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.660 
blow it up a car like this takes around
four<00:02:32.840> or<00:02:32.930> five<00:02:33.110> usually<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:34.430> this

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
four or five usually now I know this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.760 
four or five usually now I know this
isn't<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.030> craziest<00:02:35.630> trick<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.500> still

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
isn't the craziest trick but I do still

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.260 
isn't the craziest trick but I do still
think<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.160> really<00:02:37.400> useful<00:02:37.550> trick<00:02:37.970> and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
think it's a really useful trick and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.020 
think it's a really useful trick and
it's<00:02:38.510> also<00:02:38.690> pretty<00:02:39.050> fun<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.560> well<00:02:39.800> but<00:02:40.760> anyways

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's also pretty fun as well but anyways

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.950 
it's also pretty fun as well but anyways
let's<00:02:41.240> go<00:02:41.330> ahead<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.630> get<00:02:41.690> into<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> next

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
let's go ahead and get into the next

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.410 
let's go ahead and get into the next
glitch<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:42.920> basically<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.520> glitch<00:02:43.790> actually

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
glitch so basically this glitch actually

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.500 
glitch so basically this glitch actually
allows<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.640> super<00:02:46.880> speed<00:02:47.300> with

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
allows you to get like super speed with

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.330
