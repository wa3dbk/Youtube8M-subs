the end of it I gave you a brief a brief
example<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.289> rough<00:00:16.500> draft<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:17.010> is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
example of my rough draft which is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
example of my rough draft which is
really<00:00:17.460> crappy<00:00:17.840> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.080> my<00:00:19.529> good<00:00:19.770> draft

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
really crappy this is my good draft

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.279 
really crappy this is my good draft
which<00:00:20.880> came<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.289> nice<00:00:22.619> compact<00:00:23.310> easy

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
which came out really nice compact easy

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.730 
which came out really nice compact easy
as<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:26.010> you'll<00:00:26.220> hit<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> button

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
as you see here you'll hit a button

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.490 

which<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.910> give<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> quick<00:00:36.989> ticket<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
which would give a quick ticket to this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.760 
which would give a quick ticket to this

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
sending our mine cart down our trek

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.779 
sending our mine cart down our trek
they'll<00:00:43.770> hit<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.250> action<00:00:45.120> delay<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.629> coal<00:00:46.050> I

then hits another nor latch which will

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
then hits another nor latch which will
switch<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.700> track<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> mine<00:00:51.690> cart<00:00:51.840> has

its<00:01:03.390> original<00:01:04.129> original<00:01:05.129> position<00:01:05.820> pretty

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
its original original position pretty

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
its original original position pretty
easy<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.390> wasn't<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.900> easy<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
easy it wasn't really that easy to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
easy it wasn't really that easy to
figure<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.830> though<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.760> my

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
figure out though this is all my

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
figure out though this is all my
original<00:01:12.390> design<00:01:12.420> though<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:16.340> give<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
original design though so give you a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.630 
original design though so give you a
brief<00:01:18.060> example<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.369> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
brief example of this one this is the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.740 
brief example of this one this is the
big<00:01:21.000> guy<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.770> bays<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.420> each<00:01:24.420> floor

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
big guy it's three bays on each floor

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.289 
big guy it's three bays on each floor
two<00:01:25.110> floors<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.369> whole<00:01:26.790> thing's<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
two floors the whole thing's at a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.080 
two floors the whole thing's at a
dimension<00:01:27.810> from

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
dimension from

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.139 
dimension from
this<00:01:29.689> block<00:01:30.189> well<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:31.520> invisible<00:01:31.969> block

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
this block well this invisible block

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.880 
this block well this invisible block
above<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.570> block<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.890> block<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.939> twin

above this block to that block to a twin
black<00:01:36.890> block<00:01:37.189> up<00:01:37.429> there<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:38.000> only<00:01:38.479> 20<00:01:39.079> x<00:01:39.289> 22<00:01:39.890> x

black block up there is only 20 x 22 x

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.149 
black block up there is only 20 x 22 x
16<00:01:40.640> which<00:01:40.969> is<00:01:41.240> pretty<00:01:42.049> compact<00:01:42.469> considering

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
16 which is pretty compact considering

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.690 
16 which is pretty compact considering
is<00:01:43.520> fully<00:01:43.789> automatic<00:01:44.350> get<00:01:45.350> an<00:01:45.439> example<00:01:45.979> this

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
is fully automatic get an example this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.469 
is fully automatic get an example this
top<00:01:46.969> rate<00:01:47.209> minecart<00:01:47.719> comes<00:01:48.319> down<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.390> this

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
top rate minecart comes down so this

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.559 
top rate minecart comes down so this
would<00:01:53.689> be<00:01:53.810> your<00:01:53.840> basically<00:01:54.679> your<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.159> pop

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
would be your basically your can of pop

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.990 
would be your basically your can of pop
but<00:01:56.569> instead<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.049> just<00:01:57.289> taking<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.909> know

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
but instead of just taking out you know

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.600 
but instead of just taking out you know
you<00:01:59.090> pop<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.319> then<00:02:00.439> i<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.130> take<00:02:01.399> out

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
you pop and then i see it you take out

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.359 
you pop and then i see it you take out
your<00:02:01.640> pop<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.329> your<00:02:02.770> storage<00:02:03.770> card<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
your pop out of your storage card and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.589 
your pop out of your storage card and
throw<00:02:04.610> back<00:02:04.849> up<00:02:06.579> makes<00:02:07.579> its<00:02:07.789> way<00:02:07.939> back<00:02:08.179> up<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
throw back up makes its way back up to

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.400 
throw back up makes its way back up to
everything<00:02:08.840> through<00:02:09.319> all<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.470> bays<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.750> I

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
everything through all the bays and I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 
everything through all the bays and I
set<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.829> brief<00:02:16.489> little<00:02:16.670> example<00:02:17.239> here<00:02:17.269> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
set up a brief little example here to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.170 
set up a brief little example here to
show<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.750> with<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:18.459> now<00:02:19.459> all<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> purple

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
show you with this now all the purple

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.569 
show you with this now all the purple
track<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.110> activation<00:02:21.620> track<00:02:22.099> which

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
track is the activation track which

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:28.569 
track is the activation track which
whichever<00:02:23.480> track<00:02:23.780> switches<00:02:25.480> you'll<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:27.579> that

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
whichever track switches you'll see that

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.890 
whichever track switches you'll see that
last<00:02:28.790> track<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.239> I'm<00:02:29.329> pointing<00:02:29.510> at<00:02:29.720> right

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
last track that I'm pointing at right

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.199 
last track that I'm pointing at right
here<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.319> doesn't<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.940> something<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.000> switch

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
here it doesn't have something to switch

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.849 
here it doesn't have something to switch
it<00:02:32.360> obviously<00:02:32.810> because<00:02:33.139> it's<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> last<00:02:33.410> base

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
it obviously because it's the last base

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:44.170 
it obviously because it's the last base
so<00:02:35.500> go<00:02:36.500> for<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.739> quick<00:02:36.889> run<00:02:36.950> here

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.330 

right<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:47.989> oops<00:02:48.989> should<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:49.980> built<00:02:50.160> that
