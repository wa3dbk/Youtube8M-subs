happens to be available for $14.99 and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.440 
happens to be available for $14.99 and
it's<00:00:09.179> pretty<00:00:09.450> much<00:00:09.540> risk<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.849> your<00:00:11.849> computer

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it's pretty much risk for your computer

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.310 
it's pretty much risk for your computer
basic<00:00:13.320> concept<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> game<00:00:14.929> endless<00:00:15.929> hours<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
basic concept of a game endless hours of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.840 
basic concept of a game endless hours of
fun<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> multiplayer<00:00:17.789> option<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.630> land

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
fun with a multiplayer option for land

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.330 
fun with a multiplayer option for land
which<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.880> nice<00:00:21.510> another<00:00:22.350> nice<00:00:22.619> thing<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.100> as

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
which is nice another nice thing is as

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.920 
which is nice another nice thing is as
I've<00:00:23.640> mentioned<00:00:23.850> before<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.449> runs<00:00:24.660> for

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I've mentioned before it runs for

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.980 
I've mentioned before it runs for
Windows<00:00:25.260> Mac<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.980> Linux<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:27.420> far<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.779> I've

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
Windows Mac and Linux and as far as I've

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
Windows Mac and Linux and as far as I've
seen<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.500> will<00:00:28.650> run<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.039> pretty<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.429> any

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
seen this will run on pretty much any

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.900 
seen this will run on pretty much any
computer<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:32.570> yeah<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
computer because yeah just look at it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
computer because yeah just look at it
that<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> basic<00:00:39.750> concept<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that is a game so the basic concept is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.280 
that is a game so the basic concept is
much<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.129> risk<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.790> get<00:00:42.149> four<00:00:42.719> four

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
much like risk is you get four four

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
much like risk is you get four four
soldiers<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> beginning<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
soldiers in the beginning and you can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.950 
soldiers in the beginning and you can
place<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> reinforce<00:00:46.100> these<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.510> say

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
place and reinforce these now if you say

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.369 
place and reinforce these now if you say
get<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.410> small<00:00:49.800> section<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.230> sure

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
get a small section like I'm not sure

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
get a small section like I'm not sure
for<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> mouse<00:00:52.860> map<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.670> Midwest<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
for this mouse map like Midwest I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
for this mouse map like Midwest I
suppose<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.710> extra<00:00:56.129> soldiers<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.820> if

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
suppose you get extra soldiers like if

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
suppose you get extra soldiers like if
you<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.210> Memphis<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> bonus<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.980> one

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you get Memphis you get a bonus of one

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
you get Memphis you get a bonus of one
soldier<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> ton<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
soldier and then when you have a ton of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.950 
soldier and then when you have a ton of
cities<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.730> soldiers<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.510> means

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
cities you get more soldiers which means

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
cities you get more soldiers which means
you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> decimate<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> yes

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.649 

so<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.549> game<00:01:12.729> starts<00:01:13.149> out<00:01:13.270> where<00:01:13.539> you

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
so the game starts out where you

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.230 
so the game starts out where you
basically<00:01:14.159> reinforce<00:01:15.159> all<00:01:15.429> your<00:01:15.759> positions

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
basically reinforce all your positions

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:28.190 
basically reinforce all your positions
and<00:01:21.329> that's<00:01:22.329> what<00:01:22.659> I'm<00:01:22.840> doing<00:01:22.869> currently<00:01:25.500> yes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and that's what I'm doing currently yes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.480 
and that's what I'm doing currently yes
so<00:01:29.200> I'm<00:01:29.560> pretty<00:01:30.219> much<00:01:30.369> trying<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.090> decimate

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so I'm pretty much trying to decimate

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.190 
so I'm pretty much trying to decimate
these<00:01:33.490> guys<00:01:33.819> -<00:01:34.329> Black<00:01:35.069> team<00:01:36.069> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:41.020> you

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
these guys - Black team and then but you

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.770 
these guys - Black team and then but you
you<00:01:41.409> really<00:01:41.740> don't<00:01:41.890> want<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.270> spread<00:01:43.270> too<00:01:43.539> much

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
you really don't want to spread too much

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.120 
you really don't want to spread too much
at<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.170> beginning<00:01:44.259> because<00:01:44.770> you'll<00:01:44.920> get

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
at the beginning because you'll get

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.589 
at the beginning because you'll get
spread<00:01:45.520> out<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:45.970> won't<00:01:46.209> have<00:01:46.390> any

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
spread out you won't have any

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.449 
spread out you won't have any
reinforcements<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.590> any<00:01:47.770> rear<00:01:47.950> blocks<00:01:48.189> and

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
reinforcements on any rear blocks and

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:58.830 
reinforcements on any rear blocks and
then<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.899> team<00:01:49.899> will<00:01:50.110> save<00:01:50.319> up<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.799> destroy<00:01:51.599> you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.770 

so<00:02:02.040> usually<00:02:03.040> when<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.729> sort<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> section

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so usually when I just sort of section

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.169 
so usually when I just sort of section
off<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.930> chunk<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.530> back<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:09.069> I'm<00:02:09.190> gonna<00:02:09.340> try

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
off a chunk and back in so I'm gonna try

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.699 
off a chunk and back in so I'm gonna try
to<00:02:11.340> look<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.640> five<00:02:13.120> six<00:02:13.840> solders<00:02:14.230> here<00:02:14.500> than

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
to look about five six solders here than

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:31.660 
to look about five six solders here than
seven<00:02:16.470> okay<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.980> alright<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:18.849> in<00:02:19.000> turn

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.120 

so<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.240> pretty<00:02:35.720> much<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.200> game<00:02:39.130> I've

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so this is pretty much the game I've

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.710 
so this is pretty much the game I've
always<00:02:40.459> enjoyed<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:43.209> there's<00:02:44.209> there's<00:02:44.569> not

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
always enjoyed it there's there's not

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.180 
always enjoyed it there's there's not
really<00:02:44.900> much<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> say<00:02:45.410> about<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> map

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
really much to say about it the map

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.470 
really much to say about it the map
designs<00:02:46.580> are<00:02:46.760> cool<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.240> actually

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
designs are cool and you can actually

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.830 
designs are cool and you can actually
design<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.170> own<00:02:48.200> maps<00:02:49.420> multiplayer<00:02:50.420> feature

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
design your own maps multiplayer feature

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:02.920 
design your own maps multiplayer feature
works<00:02:52.090> fairly<00:02:53.090> well

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.170 

but<00:03:03.560> but<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:03.950> real<00:03:04.099> fun<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> game<00:03:04.819> comes

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
but but the real fun in the game comes

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.740 
but but the real fun in the game comes
in<00:03:05.420> when<00:03:05.629> you<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.930> like<00:03:06.969> 16<00:03:07.969> soldiers<00:03:08.269> to

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
in when you have like 16 soldiers to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660 
in when you have like 16 soldiers to
spawn<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.290> could<00:03:09.469> wipe<00:03:09.650> out<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.069> whole<00:03:10.280> area

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
spawn you could wipe out this whole area

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:27.600
