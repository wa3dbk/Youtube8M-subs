00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.480
 spontaneous autograph signing session in the Allgäu the Bundesliga stars from the 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.320
 Capital was in demand 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.610
 the complete crew together with new coach samples in the Allgäu the emergency case 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.380
 Bundesliga last year was announced at the old lady Hertha descent on 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.300
 At the end it went down to the k 2 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.840
 high in the gelunge 6 so in the national league last season for the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 TSV Kottern 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.240
 The duel yesterday was called relegated against promoted but seriously 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.890
 actually, of course, top professionals against amateurs 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.410
 despite the TSV Kottern fought with and kept in front of karl-heinz 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.900
 Riedle and hertha manager Michael Preetz can even score goals 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.210
 but this took over Christmas Stoss though late at the 33rd of the minute 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 Serbian wm participant Cassar pounding the ball into the net 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.590
 grateful break surprise for the five or 50 spectators only one goal 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.300
 Halftime two goal should not change except that Markus Babbel the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.150
 Whole team exchanged the game remained the same 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.540
 from then on there was everything but harder made the gate two to zero and final that were 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 the whole surprise 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.270
 the Magister worldwide as well as the TSV Kottern have the highest 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 expected how satisfied are you with this plays 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.180
 Also it was actually clear that there was one 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.970
 not much higher we twelve boys have to work that hard today so 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.650
 the legs are incredibly heavy an accomplice became the listener of all things 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.530
 no longer do not get one next to one or the other chance to score 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.360
 but to score goals they made them move and it was 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.490
 and biting through yes I am very pleased the players only by the result 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.650
 This time very well everyone had lent together 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.120
 in the first round we have been able to hold well against it 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.390
 and if we had one or the other chance I really had in the first one 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.500
 maybe they could still occupy the Berlin then heavy 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.110
 do us still important to win against us 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.570
 These goals for the two teams are different but simple 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.159
 Hertha BSC Berlin wants and has to get back into league one very quickly 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.159
 the TSV Kottern wants to stay in the national league 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.760
 how satisfied are you he is with the preparation again the look of the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.020
 Above all, team forward 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.150
 and now only a small look back into the very bad season 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.429
 No it is also the place percent very high for it expensive to pay 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.599
 or they are relegated to look forward with 14 percent is like that 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.339
 to let happen have a great opportunity to make amends 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.089
 percent also have Walter Dix the place supporting the rest 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.369
 Venues are 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.679
 yes is the first goal is first as fast as possible nothing to the descent 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.129
 because we already say percent no 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.999
 Have experience in the national league 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.819
 it's going to be another where it's going to be a different league than that 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.999
 other football did not play too 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.659
 a body-conscious going on like today 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.599
 but if we retrieve our performance as today as the tactical default 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.549
 Mohamed has been prioritized here but I think there is no fear of it 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.419
 no opponent 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.099
 Yesterday everybody was satisfied at the end of the TSV Kottern collected great 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.239
 Experiences Hertha BSC Berlin has been diligently training and 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.810
 The fans could breathe a lot of bundesliga air
