going to be looking at the vorcha hunter
engineer<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> new<00:00:11.759> classes<00:00:12.030> released

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
engineer one of the new classes released

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.279 
engineer one of the new classes released
this<00:00:13.080> week<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.650> multiplayer<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:15.289> my

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this week in multiplayer and my

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.740 
this week in multiplayer and my
experience<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.100> war<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.490> classes<00:00:17.970> thus<00:00:18.480> far

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
experience with war two classes thus far

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.140 
experience with war two classes thus far
as<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.109> don't<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.800> play<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.340> too<00:00:20.520> much<00:00:20.699> but

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
as I don't really play them too much but

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.000 
as I don't really play them too much but
after<00:00:21.439> experimenting<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> little<00:00:22.590> bit<00:00:22.830> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
after experimenting a little bit with

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.000 
after experimenting a little bit with
last<00:00:23.310> weekend's<00:00:23.970> challenge<00:00:24.480> using<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.010> flame

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
last weekend's challenge using the flame

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.519 
last weekend's challenge using the flame
based<00:00:26.310> attacks<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:27.840> deep<00:00:28.109> into<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
based attacks I got really deep into the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.359 
based attacks I got really deep into the
engineer<00:00:29.070> most<00:00:29.400> mostly<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.769> Sentinel<00:00:31.769> vorcha

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
engineer most mostly the Sentinel vorcha

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.889 
engineer most mostly the Sentinel vorcha
and<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.320> being<00:00:34.620> released<00:00:35.899> there's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and with this one being released there's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
and with this one being released there's
some<00:00:37.200> good<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.180> bad<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
some good and there's a lot of bad the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
some good and there's a lot of bad the
good<00:00:40.410> part<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.730> an

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
good part is is that you have an

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
good part is is that you have an
engineer<00:00:42.360> class<00:00:42.660> which<00:00:43.110> has<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> Morcha

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
engineer class which has the Morcha

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
engineer class which has the Morcha
resilience<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.140> best

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
resilience which is probably the best

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
resilience which is probably the best
thing<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> Vorta<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> rapid<00:00:48.210> health

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
thing about the Vorta the rapid health

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
thing about the Vorta the rapid health
regeneration<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.590> comes<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> handy<00:00:50.010> on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
regeneration really comes in handy on

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
regeneration really comes in handy on
higher<00:00:50.700> difficulties<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> bad<00:00:53.039> part<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
higher difficulties but the bad part is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
higher difficulties but the bad part is
the<00:00:54.000> powers<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.480> Bioware<00:00:55.320> gave<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.949> class

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the powers that Bioware gave this class

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.720 
the powers that Bioware gave this class
really<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.629> impressive<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.550> this

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really are that impressive with this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.080 
really are that impressive with this
class<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> submission<00:01:01.230> net<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
class you get the submission net and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.440 
class you get the submission net and
incinerate<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:04.680> submission<00:01:05.549> net<00:01:05.820> while

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
incinerate and in submission net while

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.700 
incinerate and in submission net while
it<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:06.990> work<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.790> situations

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
it does work well in some situations

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.560 
it does work well in some situations
overall<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.490> power<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
overall it's not a power that you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.160 
overall it's not a power that you can
just<00:01:12.930> use<00:01:13.020> whenever<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just use whenever you want to this is a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
just use whenever you want to this is a
great<00:01:16.650> power<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.299> incapacitating<00:01:18.299> things

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
great power for incapacitating things

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
great power for incapacitating things
like<00:01:18.840> dragoons<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.710> phantoms<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.490> fighting

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
like dragoons or phantoms when fighting

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
like dragoons or phantoms when fighting
servers<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.750> maybe<00:01:22.140> even<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.710> Pyro's<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
servers or maybe even get Pyro's and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
servers or maybe even get Pyro's and
hunters<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> pinch<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.200> other

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hunters if you're in a pinch but other

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.969 
hunters if you're in a pinch but other
than<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.600> does<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.290> help<00:01:28.710> out

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
than that it really does not help out

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.060 
than that it really does not help out
that<00:01:29.460> much<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.750> incinerate<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.860> are

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that much and with incinerate you are

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
that much and with incinerate you are
able<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.520> deal<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.450> damage<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
able to deal a lot of damage to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560 
able to deal a lot of damage to
unarmored<00:01:34.530> targets<00:01:35.040> allowing<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
unarmored targets allowing them to be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
unarmored targets allowing them to be
caught<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.900> fire<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.500> stunned

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
caught on fire and be stunned

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.980 
caught on fire and be stunned
essentially<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.180> overload<00:01:39.750> would

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
essentially the same as overload would

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
essentially the same as overload would
do<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.350> neural<00:01:40.650> shock<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.820> also<00:01:41.970> deals<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
do with neural shock and it also deals a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
do with neural shock and it also deals a
decent<00:01:42.840> amount<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.140> damage<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> armor<00:01:44.060> but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
decent amount of damage to armor but

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
decent amount of damage to armor but
really<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> speak

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
really that's all there is to speak

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.190 
really that's all there is to speak
about<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.520> class<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.390> only<00:01:48.689> thing<00:01:48.899> really

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
about this class the only thing really

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
about this class the only thing really
good<00:01:49.680> about<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.090> vorcha

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
good about it is again the vorcha

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
good about it is again the vorcha
resilience<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:52.890> why<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.790> like

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
resilience and that's why I really like

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.330 
resilience and that's why I really like
this<00:01:54.750> probably<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> only<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.070> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this probably the only thing I like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670 
this probably the only thing I like
about<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.640> class<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.049> fact<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.500> can

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
about this class is the fact that I can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709
