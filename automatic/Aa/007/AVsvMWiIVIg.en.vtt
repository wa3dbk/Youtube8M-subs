ground it just does damage to mobs and
players<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:03.880> whatnot<00:01:04.360> then<00:01:05.320> we<00:01:05.439> have<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
lightning bow which is also pretty cool

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.570 
lightning bow which is also pretty cool

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
so if i get a creeper i'm hoping to make

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.880 
so if i get a creeper i'm hoping to make
one<00:01:12.730> of<00:01:12.880> those<00:01:13.030> what<00:01:13.930> they<00:01:14.080> call<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.560> creeper

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
with the lightning so let me have a go

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860 
with the lightning so let me have a go
at<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:20.230> there<00:01:21.190> we<00:01:21.370> go<00:01:21.520> look<00:01:22.510> at<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.750> that's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
at that there we go look at that that's

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.630 
at that there we go look at that that's
pretty<00:01:23.200> awesome<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:23.980> can<00:01:24.100> now<00:01:24.220> make<00:01:24.400> these

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
pretty awesome so you can now make these

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.330 
pretty awesome so you can now make these
sorts<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.300> creepers<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:27.280> well<00:01:28.260> so<00:01:29.340> then

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
sorts of creepers as well so then

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.830 
sorts of creepers as well so then
there's<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.670> teleport<00:01:31.090> boat<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.630> is

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
there's the teleport boat so this is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.690 
there's the teleport boat so this is
really<00:01:32.290> sort<00:01:32.740> your<00:01:32.920> own<00:01:33.130> travel<00:01:33.550> long

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
really sort your own travel long

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.120 
really sort your own travel long
distances<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.900> can<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.229> fire<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.560> wherever

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
distances you can just fire it wherever

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.540 
distances you can just fire it wherever
you<00:01:36.280> want<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.550> go<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:38.050> arrow<00:01:38.560> will

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
you want to go and the arrow will

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.480 
you want to go and the arrow will
teleport<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.600> wherever<00:01:40.870> atlanta<00:01:41.320> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
teleport you wherever atlanta and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.539 
teleport you wherever atlanta and
finally<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.760> provo<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.979> similar<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
finally the provo which is similar to

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.200 
finally the provo which is similar to
the<00:01:45.640> temple<00:01:46.030> boat<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:47.950> carries<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.670> sort

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the temple boat but it carries you sort

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
the temple boat but it carries you sort
of<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:49.420> top<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.960> arrows<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.290> moves<00:01:50.620> along

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of on top of the arrows of moves along

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.580 
of on top of the arrows of moves along
which<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:52.210> pretty<00:01:52.450> cool<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.870> saw<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.290> another

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
which is pretty cool I saw that another

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.149 
which is pretty cool I saw that another
plugin<00:01:53.830> but<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.940> has<00:01:55.120> more<00:01:55.360> functionality

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
plugin but this has more functionality

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.770 
plugin but this has more functionality
now<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.220> main<00:01:57.580> command<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:57.970> bow<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.180> what<00:01:58.690> you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
now the main command is bow and what you

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.640 
now the main command is bow and what you
can<00:01:58.930> do<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.049> can<00:01:59.170> do<00:01:59.350> boat<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.740> tone<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:01.650> here

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
can do you can do boat in tone and here

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.910 
can do you can do boat in tone and here
we<00:02:02.799> go

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
we go

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.039 
we go
so<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.969> said<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.509> are<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.869> the
