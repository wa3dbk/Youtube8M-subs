00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.689
 good morning we are in rialto a store 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 opened a store about 30 years ago 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.150
 mask lab and we're right 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 at feet or other powers 30 meters I am 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 the family elections also i 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.640
 gondoliers 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.180
 practically grown in a gondola though 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.360
 then left the gorge to start the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.360
 my activity of masking and painter the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.120
 3d masquerade ie masks 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.989
 let's just say to revive popular dates a 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 modena starting from 79 80 when with 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.260
 the help of the biennial carnival has 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.250
 had notable loss after years and years 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.250
 decades we say 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.790
 we must not forget that the mask 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.510
 and disguise therefore the theater acts as a 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.940
 master that people mask themselves 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.570
 people mask themselves because they need to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.200
 have moments where they are free from 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.040
 any kind of problems too 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.020
 that mind 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.930
 let's say the weather here stores where 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.670
 we work and space does not allow us to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.950
 create however clearly I dress I go out 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.300
 with friends we maybe small 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.820
 performance 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.260
 let's try to create the corners by looking 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.800
 of meat a bit of poetry in some 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.440
 nook 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 i love jester very much swear like 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.850
 character really a couple of marks e 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.840
 I am very fond of our lunacy 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 carnival even when maybe in jargon 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 of works 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.540
 the newspapers that after are precisely 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.120
 a particular details is called 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.120
 marcello in honor of mastroianni 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.830
 we will find one of those male from a 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.510
 consumption of that type ii try it for a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.490
 another day would be something that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.810
 they should all ie just come off 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.100
 a particular world opens up from the world 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 unlike the theater where there is indeed 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.360
 an involvement the II is not present 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.260
 look at the world inside the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.150
 mask and looks like a sound is one 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.120
 great feeling 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.319
 maybe a part of the carnival that everyone 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.709
 should understand the origin is also the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.180
 venetian carnival this part here 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.689
 we should all be missing 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.140
 venice at this time a lot of theater 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.859
 once grotesque times that circuit 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.420
 that irony while this one 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.069
 delicacy of these characters that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.069
 they make too many with beautiful to see 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.239
 strange that happened to him 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.730
 yes we say that our work is a 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.090
 work is a job that can also give you 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.620
 satisfactions of pleasant moments 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.290
 let's say they got the chance 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.209
 to work for the film maybe even 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.700
 very challenging like that of eyes 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.889
 stanley kubrick's wide shut maybe it's there 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.459
 there is not a very professional speech 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.720
 It was a long time to have moments 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.269
 quincy jones that we couldn't 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.349
 find it we were not looking for a party yes 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:13.970
 he was lost in Murano dressed as a friar and he is 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.970
 a party arrived late
