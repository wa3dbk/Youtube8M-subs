00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
of the game compared to the the chatting

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.230 
of the game compared to the the chatting
so<00:06:01.410> if<00:06:01.560> you're<00:06:01.680> playing<00:06:01.920> a<00:06:02.010> game<00:06:02.190> online<00:06:02.400> and

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
so if you're playing a game online and

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.060 
so if you're playing a game online and
you<00:06:03.480> can't<00:06:03.720> hear<00:06:03.900> people<00:06:04.200> too<00:06:04.350> well<00:06:04.560> you<00:06:04.920> would

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
you can't hear people too well you would

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.040 
you can't hear people too well you would
you<00:06:05.220> know<00:06:05.370> want<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.060> turn<00:06:06.240> down<00:06:06.450> the<00:06:06.630> gaming

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
you know want to turn down the gaming

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.020 
you know want to turn down the gaming
value<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:07.770> turn<00:06:07.950> up<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.130> voice<00:06:08.430> value<00:06:08.850> or

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
value and turn up the voice value or

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.800 
value and turn up the voice value or
vice<00:06:09.180> versa<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.440> that's<00:06:10.650> how<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:10.830> works<00:06:11.810> now

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
vice versa so that's how that works now

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.810 
vice versa so that's how that works now
this<00:06:12.990> piece<00:06:13.290> up<00:06:13.590> here<00:06:14.240> detaches<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:16.610> they<00:06:17.610> have

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
this piece up here detaches so they have

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.620 
this piece up here detaches so they have
other<00:06:19.460> plugins<00:06:20.460> that<00:06:20.910> you<00:06:21.120> can<00:06:21.270> use<00:06:21.450> other
