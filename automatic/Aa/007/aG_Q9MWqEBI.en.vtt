to look at this whole entire video is
gonna<00:00:28.349> cover<00:00:28.529> flanking<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> i'm<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
gonna cover flanking and i'm going to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
gonna cover flanking and i'm going to
show<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> greatest<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.710> get

show you this is the greatest way to get

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350 
show you this is the greatest way to get
kills<00:00:32.189> insertion<00:00:32.700> destroy<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.300> were

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
kills insertion destroy if they were

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
kills insertion destroy if they were
played<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> ever<00:00:34.770> play<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
played so if you ever play it so

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
played so if you ever play it so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
basically i run behind them to a point

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.610 
basically i run behind them to a point
where<00:00:38.420> they<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> expect<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:40.290> coming

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
where they would not expect me coming

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
where they would not expect me coming
that's<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.100> linking<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.379> with<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that's what for linking is and with a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
that's what for linking is and with a
silencer<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> mp7<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.239> i

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
silencer is well on the mp7 right here i

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.160 
silencer is well on the mp7 right here i
can<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:47.329> get<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> jump<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:48.960> them

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
can pretty much get the jump on all them

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.660 
can pretty much get the jump on all them
and<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:50.309> i'm<00:00:50.730> basically<00:00:51.510> flanking<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
and that i'm basically flanking them and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
and that i'm basically flanking them and
coming<00:00:53.670> after<00:00:53.969> them<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.230> my<00:00:55.320> direction

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
coming after them from from my direction

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.250 
coming after them from from my direction
they<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:55.860> expect<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> i<00:00:57.840> thought<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.050> guy

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
they don't expect and i thought this guy

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
they don't expect and i thought this guy
was<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.710> some<00:00:58.829> reason<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.910> he's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
awesome with the mp7 silencer it's a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.920 
awesome with the mp7 silencer it's a
great<00:01:04.229> gun<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.689> route

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
going to run down by a and this would be

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
going to run down by a and this would be
only<00:01:39.570> whenever<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.500> be
