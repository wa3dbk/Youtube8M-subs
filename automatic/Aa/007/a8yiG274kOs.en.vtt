00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:19.967
After taking the toddler's measurements, we can make the block pattern.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.467
All we need is a Zouzou, hello Zouzou !
(Hello !)

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:32.256
as well as pens, a calculator, a drawingbracket, a French curve and a ruler.

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:38.410
Take a sheet of paper (15 x 23")
and draw a vertical line in the middle

00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:43.315
2" from the bottom, draw a horizontal line.

00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.835
This is the waist line.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.985
Write A at the crossing.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.886
place B so that AB = back waist length

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.164
Place C so that AC = front waist length minus 0.39"

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:08.230
Place D so that AD = bust measurement divided by 4

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.758
This is the back

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.778
Then, place D' which is also 1/4 bust measurement away from A.

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:20.124
DA = AD'

00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:23.037
This is the front.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.013
Then place F

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:33.308
AF = (back waist length + front waist length) / 4

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.223
Mark a line perpendicular to F.
and place E so that FE = DA

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.547
We do the same at the front.
FE' = EF

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:57.044
(and = AD' !)
Well done ! I see you are being very careful !
( I'm not just a pretty face...)

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.918
So that was the bust line.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.044
Place G right in the middle between C and F.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:09.235
Mark GM which is the cross back measurement.

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:17.317
Do the same at the front.
GM' = cross front measurement.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.909
That is the cross front and back line.

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.460
For the neckline, we first mark BH.

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:29.244
BH = ((1/2 neckline measurement) / 4) + 0,31"

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:34.323
Do the same at the front with BH'.

00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:37.988
BH = BH'

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.924
Mark a line : CJ.
CJ = BH.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:53.337
Do the same at the front.
CJ' = BH'

00:02:53.308 --> 00:03:02.886
Now be very careful...!  Square off a line HI
HI = 1/4 BH

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:13.051
But at the front, H'I' = 1/4 BH - 0,19"

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:19.391
Square off JK.
K is 1/3 IJ

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:22.183
(That means you should measure IJ.)

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:30.864
at the front, place K'.
J'K' = (1/4 IJ) - 0,19"

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:37.609
Draw the grey landmarks.
One from K. One from K'.

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:42.212
(Can I draw the pattern now ???)
Go ahead !!

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:46.579
Draw the back neckline using a french curve.

00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:54.676
as for the shoulder line, you have to measure at I
and meet the grey line...

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.296
Let me explain :

00:03:56.295 --> 00:04:05.196
let say the shoulder length is 2,75" (7cm)...
Stick the ruler at 2,75"
and tilt the ruler until the zero meets the grey line.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.196
should the shoulder length be longer,
the ruler will meet the grey line a little further.
(I see...!)

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:47.037
(hum, hum ! Next time, I will show you the enlargements..!)

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:57.311
Tell me... how was I ?
Very good ! Super ! Excellent!  Great ! Fantastic! Green ! Super green..!
Really ?
