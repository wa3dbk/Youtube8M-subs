were by Conair and I got a mint target
and<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.179> cool<00:00:12.360> thing<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.570> these<00:00:12.900> are<00:00:13.320> that

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and the cool thing about these are that

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.640 
and the cool thing about these are that
they<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.710> four<00:00:14.130> jumbo<00:00:14.759> rollers<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:16.289> big

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
they have four jumbo rollers this big

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.680 
they have four jumbo rollers this big
and<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.100> there<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.369> eight<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.270> big<00:00:18.449> ones

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and then there are eight of the big ones

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.990 
and then there are eight of the big ones
back<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> old<00:00:19.920> days<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.279> used<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> have

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
back in the old days they used to have

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
back in the old days they used to have
those<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.480> ones<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> medium<00:00:22.380> ones<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
those little ones in the medium ones and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
those little ones in the medium ones and
they<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.250> didn't<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.730> work<00:00:23.910> well<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.480> my

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
they just didn't really work well on my

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140 
they just didn't really work well on my
hair<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:24.960> least<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.670> set<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.060> I'm

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
hair at least so that's the set that I'm

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
hair at least so that's the set that I'm
using<00:00:27.390> you'll<00:00:28.230> notice<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> first

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
using you'll notice this is the first

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.380 
using you'll notice this is the first
time<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.849> I've<00:00:29.970> used<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:31.700> set<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.149> don't

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
time that I've used this set and I don't

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.410 
time that I've used this set and I don't
think<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.690> let<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.309> plug<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.550> long<00:00:35.880> enough<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
think I let them plug in long enough in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
think I let them plug in long enough in
the<00:00:36.480> beginning<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.590> as

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the beginning so they're not really as

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
the beginning so they're not really as
hot<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.370> should<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.640> been<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.510> anyway

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
hot as they should have been but anyway

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
hot as they should have been but anyway
you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> general<00:00:40.559> idea<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.489> want

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you can get the general idea if you want

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
you can get the general idea if you want
to<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.690> thanks<00:00:43.260> for

one of the Jumbo rollers for this one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.359 
one of the Jumbo rollers for this one
and<00:00:58.640> I'm<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.850> rolling<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> back<00:01:01.489> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and I'm just rolling it back and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
and I'm just rolling it back and
basically<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.670> whole<00:01:05.880> hair<00:01:06.290> on<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.500> whole

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.539 
basically the whole hair on my whole
head<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> go<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.280> I'm

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
head I want it to go back so I think I'm

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.899 
head I want it to go back so I think I'm
just<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> purple<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
just gonna take a purple one here and

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.070 
just gonna take a purple one here and
roll<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.150> again<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:20.509> I'm<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.840> do

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
roll it back again and I'm just gonna do

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:33.340 
roll it back again and I'm just gonna do
the<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:22.380> part<00:01:22.409> first

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.140 

basically<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.700> messy

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
basically it's probably a little messy

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
basically it's probably a little messy
but<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> looks<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.799> they're

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but that's what it looks like they're

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
but that's what it looks like they're
all<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.400> back<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
all going back then what I'm going to do

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
all going back then what I'm going to do
is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> sides<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> probably<00:01:44.119> I'll<00:01:45.119> start<00:01:45.630> back

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
is the sides so probably I'll start back

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
is the sides so probably I'll start back
here<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:47.520> taking<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> brush<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.820> I'm

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
here just taking it brush it out and I'm

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.749 
here just taking it brush it out and I'm
gonna<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> purple<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.840> still<00:01:52.579> I'm<00:01:53.579> going

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
gonna use the purple one still I'm going

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.719 
gonna use the purple one still I'm going
to<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.180> bigger<00:01:54.450> ones<00:01:54.750> probably<00:01:55.729> right

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to use the bigger ones probably right

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:06.480 
to use the bigger ones probably right
here<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.439> Jumbo<00:01:59.009> ones

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:17.130 

I<00:02:09.869> hope<00:02:10.869> these<00:02:11.080> were<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:12.640> enough<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.690> then

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
I hope these were not enough and then

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.330 
I hope these were not enough and then
I'm<00:02:17.260> probably<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.740> take<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.160> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I'm probably going to take one of the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.699 
I'm probably going to take one of the
Jumbos<00:02:18.850> four<00:02:19.240> right<00:02:19.390> here<00:02:19.420> since<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.380> piece

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
Jumbos four right here since this piece

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.050 
Jumbos four right here since this piece
is<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:21.720> layered<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:24.430> want<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.819> curl

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
is very layered I don't want it to curl

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.580 
is very layered I don't want it to curl
up<00:02:25.120> too<00:02:25.510> short<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.080> I'm<00:02:26.170> going<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.350> take<00:02:26.530> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
up too short so I'm going to take a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.940 
up too short so I'm going to take a
jumbo<00:02:26.950> one<00:02:27.280> here<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.350> roll<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.830> back<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
jumbo one here and roll it back the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.710 
jumbo one here and roll it back the
bangs<00:02:33.190> I'll<00:02:33.610> figure<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.030> what<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.390> do<00:02:34.569> with

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
bangs I'll figure out what to do with

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.160 
bangs I'll figure out what to do with
this<00:02:34.989> later<00:02:36.810> probably<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.050> make

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
this later probably going to make

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.060 
this later probably going to make
another<00:02:38.440> jumbo<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:40.530> actually<00:02:41.530> I'll<00:02:41.650> save<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
another jumbo here actually I'll save it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.990 
another jumbo here actually I'll save it
for<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.670> other<00:02:42.790> side<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.550> I'm<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.850> gonna

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
for the other side so I'm just gonna

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.780 
for the other side so I'm just gonna
roll<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.540> back<00:02:52.500> okay<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.010> same<00:02:54.310> thing<00:02:54.550> on<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
roll this back okay so same thing on the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.509 
roll this back okay so same thing on the
other<00:02:54.820> side<00:02:55.000> oh<00:02:55.570> yeah<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.250> how<00:02:57.400> it

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
other side oh yeah so that's how it

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.860 
other side oh yeah so that's how it
looks

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
looks

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.890 
looks
I'm<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.530> gonna<00:02:59.650> spray<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.209> red<00:03:01.600> can

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
I'm just gonna spray it this is red can

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.350 
I'm just gonna spray it this is red can
18<00:03:02.440> one<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.800> my<00:03:02.890> favorite<00:03:03.310> hair<00:03:03.489> sprays<00:03:03.850> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
18 one of my favorite hair sprays and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.320 
18 one of my favorite hair sprays and
then<00:03:05.140> what<00:03:05.590> I'll<00:03:05.709> probably<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.610> put<00:03:07.300> a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
then what I'll probably do is put a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.229 
then what I'll probably do is put a
little<00:03:07.630> bit<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.290> bangs<00:03:08.790> after<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.090> what

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
little bit in the bangs after so what

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.060 
little bit in the bangs after so what
I'm<00:03:10.300> gonna<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.630> turn<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:10.989> off<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.590> wait

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
I'm gonna do is turn this off and wait

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.590 
I'm gonna do is turn this off and wait
about<00:03:12.700> ten<00:03:13.120> minutes

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
about ten minutes

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.520 
about ten minutes
and<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:14.860> see<00:03:15.010> what<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.190> looks<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:16.530> okay

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
and we can see what it looks like okay

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.770 
and we can see what it looks like okay
so<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:17.890> think<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.459> been<00:03:18.760> about<00:03:19.060> ten<00:03:19.570> minutes

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
so I think it's been about ten minutes

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.390 
so I think it's been about ten minutes
and<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.070> make<00:03:21.220> sure

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
and really you just want to make sure

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.150 
and really you just want to make sure
they're<00:03:21.640> not<00:03:21.790> hot<00:03:22.630> anymore<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.950> what<00:03:24.070> I'm

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
they're not hot anymore so what I'm

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.949 
they're not hot anymore so what I'm
gonna<00:03:24.250> do<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.549> start<00:03:24.790> at<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.120> top<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
gonna do is start at the top and the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.690 
gonna do is start at the top and the
trick<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.230> taking<00:03:26.680> out<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.920> roamers<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.430> think

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
trick to taking out the roamers I think

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.539 
trick to taking out the roamers I think
is<00:03:27.910> pulling<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.530> way<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.950> was<00:03:30.220> rolled

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
is pulling it the way that it was rolled

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.460 
is pulling it the way that it was rolled
this<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.450> jumbo<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.260> I'm<00:03:32.320> going<00:03:32.440> to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this is a jumbo one so I'm going to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.979 
this is a jumbo one so I'm going to
stick<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.709> one<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.130> there<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.700> that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
stick that one on there so that

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.979 
stick that one on there so that
hopefully<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.350> heat<00:03:35.560> back<00:03:35.709> up<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.870> do

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
hopefully can heat back up and I can do

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.020 
hopefully can heat back up and I can do
the<00:03:38.140> banks<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.860> I'm<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.790> take

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the banks so I'm just going to take

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.490 
the banks so I'm just going to take
these<00:03:40.209> out

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:04:01.570 

[Music]

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
and so usually with hot rollers you just

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.110 
and so usually with hot rollers you just
get<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.130> body<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.760> you're<00:04:06.110> looking<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:08.120> so

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
one back on just for a minute and I'm

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.940 
one back on just for a minute and I'm
going<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:21.080> probably<00:04:22.080> just<00:04:22.440> put<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.920> my

bangs<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.730> little<00:04:24.240> bit<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.660> don't<00:04:25.350> want<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
bangs for a little bit I don't want the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.510 
bangs for a little bit I don't want the
sausage<00:04:25.890> roll<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:27.650> I'm<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.800> gonna<00:04:28.980> put<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.310> in

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
sausage roll so I'm just gonna put it in

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.560 
sausage roll so I'm just gonna put it in
there<00:04:29.730> for<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.060> minute

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
there for a minute

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.420 
there for a minute
I<00:04:30.600> don't<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.500> was<00:04:31.680> hotter<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:32.040> would<00:04:32.250> just

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
I don't if this was hotter I would just

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.600 
I don't if this was hotter I would just
hold<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.820> but<00:04:33.210> since<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:33.870> been<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.230> my<00:04:34.320> hair

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
hold it but since it's been in my hair

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.350 
hold it but since it's been in my hair
it's<00:04:35.610> probably<00:04:35.970> not<00:04:36.510> hot<00:04:36.810> enough<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:41.180> guess<00:04:42.180> you

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
it's probably not hot enough I guess you

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.270 
it's probably not hot enough I guess you
can<00:04:42.540> get<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> idea<00:04:45.290> again<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.590> like<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.040> tease

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
can get the idea again I like to tease

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.840 
can get the idea again I like to tease
at<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.790> top<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> little<00:04:48.420> bit<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:50.520> then<00:04:50.610> just

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
at the top a little bit and then just

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.010 
at the top a little bit and then just
bring<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.210> back<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.420> lot<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.690> layers

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
bring it back and I have a lot of layers

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.659 
bring it back and I have a lot of layers
right<00:04:55.440> now<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:55.920> that's<00:04:56.070> why<00:04:56.280> it's<00:04:56.460> kind<00:04:56.580> of

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
right now so that's why it's kind of

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.750 
right now so that's why it's kind of
flipping<00:04:57.030> out<00:04:57.180> everywhere

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
flipping out everywhere

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.090 
flipping out everywhere
and<00:04:59.870> then<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.140> just<00:05:01.350> kind<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.590> twist<00:05:01.830> them

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
and then you can just kind of twist them

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.490 
and then you can just kind of twist them
the<00:05:02.250> ones<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.610> are<00:05:02.730> hanging<00:05:02.940> right<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.660> then

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
the ones that are hanging right and then

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.520 
the ones that are hanging right and then
you<00:05:04.650> should<00:05:04.710> have<00:05:05.130> some<00:05:05.340> volume<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.270> back

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
you should have some volume in the back

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.380 
you should have some volume in the back
where<00:05:07.530> we<00:05:07.680> put<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.010> big<00:05:08.220> roller<00:05:08.520> again<00:05:09.240> I've

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
where we put that big roller again I've

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.180 
where we put that big roller again I've
got<00:05:09.540> lots<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.990> layers<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.560> that's<00:05:10.770> why<00:05:10.950> you're

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
got lots of layers so that's why you're

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.280 
got lots of layers so that's why you're
seeing<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.700> curl<00:05:12.150> I'm<00:05:12.720> not<00:05:12.900> sure<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.169> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
seeing it curl I'm not sure if the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.900 
seeing it curl I'm not sure if the
rollers<00:05:13.590> were<00:05:13.770> as<00:05:13.890> hot<00:05:14.130> as<00:05:14.370> they<00:05:14.520> need<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.790> be

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
rollers were as hot as they need to be

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.210 
rollers were as hot as they need to be
and<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:16.260> that's<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> first<00:05:16.800> one<00:05:16.950> with<00:05:17.100> those

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
and so that's the first one with those

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.890 
and so that's the first one with those
rollers<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:18.000> looks<00:05:18.270> okay

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
rollers it looks okay

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.840 
rollers it looks okay
I<00:05:18.930> can<00:05:19.530> probably<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:20.250> know<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.400> tried<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.700> put

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
I can probably you know I tried to put

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.570 
I can probably you know I tried to put
them<00:05:20.940> in<00:05:21.060> pretty<00:05:21.300> fast<00:05:21.510> but<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.919> like<00:05:23.400> those

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
them in pretty fast but I like those

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.430 
them in pretty fast but I like those
rollers<00:05:23.970> they're<00:05:24.270> big<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:25.320> next
