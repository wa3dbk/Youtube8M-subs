00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

there's<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.539> few<00:00:00.690> single<00:00:01.050> coil<00:00:01.290> flavors<00:00:01.800> on

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
there's a few single coil flavors on

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.350 
there's a few single coil flavors on
here<00:00:02.129> as<00:00:02.220> well<00:00:02.399> they<00:00:02.610> all<00:00:02.730> do<00:00:02.939> slightly

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
here as well they all do slightly

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.269 
here as well they all do slightly
different<00:00:03.780> things<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.290> hope<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.980> can<00:00:05.130> hear

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
different things I hope you can hear

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.530 
different things I hope you can hear
this<00:00:07.040> let<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.340> position<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:08.910> you've<00:00:09.389> got

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this let this position for you've got

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.490 
this let this position for you've got
that<00:00:09.719> coil<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:11.010> coil<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:12.019> me<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
that coil and this coil and me it's the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:49.500 
that coil and this coil and me it's the
Texan<00:00:14.009> setting

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.450 

so<00:00:50.510> there's<00:00:50.930> still<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.320> bit<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.649> snarl<00:00:52.070> there

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
so there's still a bit of a snarl there

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.430 
so there's still a bit of a snarl there
it's<00:00:52.670> kind<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.879> dirty<00:00:53.120> single-coil<00:00:53.989> sound

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.290 

you<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.590> pair<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:57.829> with<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:58.670> coil<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.149> this

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
you can pair it with this coil in this

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:22.950 
you can pair it with this coil in this
coil<00:00:59.540> it<00:01:00.469> should<00:01:00.710> be<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.860> little<00:01:01.160> prettier

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.800 

there's<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.080> little<00:01:24.259> more<00:01:24.440> dire<00:01:24.830> straits<00:01:25.280> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
there's a little more dire straits and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.990 
there's a little more dire straits and
you<00:01:26.810> can<00:01:26.960> hear<00:01:27.110> out<00:01:27.350> oh<00:01:29.410> that's<00:01:30.410> this<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:34.000> so

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
you can hear out oh that's this one so

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.779 
you can hear out oh that's this one so
completely<00:01:35.570> different<00:01:36.020> character<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.789> I

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
completely different character and I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.820 
completely different character and I
think<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.210> pretty<00:01:38.420> up<00:01:38.780> even<00:01:39.259> more<00:01:39.470> by

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
think I can pretty up even more by

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.139 
think I can pretty up even more by
selecting<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.340> middle<00:01:40.580> position<00:01:41.000> which

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
selecting the middle position which

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.499 
selecting the middle position which
gives<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.690> coil<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:42.590> coil<00:01:43.509> and

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
gives you this coil and this coil and

00:01:44.509 --> 00:02:06.180 
gives you this coil and this coil and
love<00:01:44.750> doing<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.550> now

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.430 

if<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.369> move<00:02:07.580> over<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.030> clean<00:02:08.630> channel<00:02:08.660> just

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
if I move over to the clean channel just

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.660 
if I move over to the clean channel just
for<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> moment<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.009> really<00:02:10.429> hear<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
for a moment you really hear the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:37.240 
for a moment you really hear the
difference<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.170> good<00:02:36.380> sound<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.950> even

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
difference it's a good sound right even

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.880 
difference it's a good sound right even
with<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:40.989> even<00:02:41.989> with<00:02:42.110> all<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.319> distortion

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
with it even with all the distortion

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.380 
with it even with all the distortion
that<00:02:43.069> something<00:02:43.400> called<00:02:43.640> about<00:02:43.880> those<00:02:44.150> two

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that something called about those two

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
that something called about those two
coils<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.080> lot<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.410> attack<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.220> get<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
coils you get a lot of attack you get a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.860 
coils you get a lot of attack you get a
lot<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.550> definition<00:02:47.269> at<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.450> start<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.780> each

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
lot of definition at the start of each

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.280 
lot of definition at the start of each
know<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.400> them<00:02:53.110> if<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.230> like

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
know so if you like them if you like

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
know so if you like them if you like
doing<00:02:54.709> all<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:54.860> stuff<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.880> can<00:02:56.060> hear<00:02:56.360> how

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
doing all that stuff you can hear how

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.789 
doing all that stuff you can hear how
much<00:02:56.840> bite<00:02:57.110> there<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:59.170> at<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.319> start<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.680> each

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
much bite there is at the start of each

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.510 
much bite there is at the start of each
no<00:03:01.070> useful<00:03:02.060> sound
