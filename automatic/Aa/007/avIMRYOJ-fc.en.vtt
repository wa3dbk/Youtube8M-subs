a limited height to show us how the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
a limited height to show us how the
system<00:00:27.119> works<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.660> Jeff<00:00:27.869> Halsey<00:00:28.260> from

you<00:00:30.570> could<00:00:30.720> give<00:00:31.019> us<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.230> quick<00:00:31.410> demonstration

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you could give us a quick demonstration

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
you could give us a quick demonstration
to<00:00:32.160> show<00:00:32.219> us<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> power<00:00:32.790> liftgate

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to show us out of power liftgate

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.049 
to show us out of power liftgate
functions<00:00:33.719> yeah<00:00:34.140> definitely<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.550> just

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
functions yeah definitely so i just

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.810 
functions yeah definitely so i just
opened<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.450> vehicle<00:00:37.079> rear<00:00:37.620> door<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> key

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
opened the vehicle rear door with a key

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.810 
opened the vehicle rear door with a key
fob<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.629> key<00:00:39.809> fob<00:00:40.020> control<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.559> well

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
fob so you get key fob control as well

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.750 
fob so you get key fob control as well
so<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> opened<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.550> maximum<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so that this is opened the maximum so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
so that this is opened the maximum so
this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> upper<00:00:45.539> limit<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> range<00:00:46.530> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this is the upper limit of the range so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
this is the upper limit of the range so
you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.149> step<00:00:48.360> under<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you can see I can step under it so to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.860 
you can see I can step under it so to
program<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> door<00:00:51.680> first<00:00:52.680> activate<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> door

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
program the door first activate the door

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
program the door first activate the door
so<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.989> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.530> only<00:00:55.920> open<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.520> high

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so we want to it's only open this high

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.750 
so we want to it's only open this high
you're<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> push<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> button<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.829> hold

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you're going to push the button and hold

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
you're going to push the button and hold
for<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.270> seconds<00:01:00.750> until<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.800> hear<00:01:01.949> four

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
for two seconds until you hear four

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.840 
for two seconds until you hear four
beeps<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.830> that's<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> program<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
beeps and that's going to program the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.020 
beeps and that's going to program the
door<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.299> open<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.780> far<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.880> we<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
door to only open this far so we can

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.899 
door to only open this far so we can
close<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.450> door<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
close the door now and then when we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.480 
close the door now and then when we
reopen<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> stop<00:01:14.010> at<00:01:14.280> this

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
reopen it it's going to stop at this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
reopen it it's going to stop at this
point<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.509> whether<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.110> open<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> key

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
point so whether we open it from the key

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
point so whether we open it from the key
fob<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> door<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> be

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
fob or the door now it's going to be

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.910 
fob or the door now it's going to be
programmed<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.189> open<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.640> height<00:01:21.920> now

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
programmed to open to that height now

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.039 
programmed to open to that height now
this<00:01:23.070> system<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> optional<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> limited

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
trim level on the 2013 rav4 you can see

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
trim level on the 2013 rav4 you can see
that's<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> goes<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.799> reset

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's how it goes and how do you reset

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
that's how it goes and how do you reset
the<00:01:32.189> system<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> full<00:01:33.600> height<00:01:33.810> out

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the system to go back to full height out

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.010 
the system to go back to full height out
operation<00:01:34.619> great<00:01:35.009> question<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> before<00:01:36.810> we

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
operation great question so before we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
operation great question so before we
hit<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> button<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> held<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.820> two

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
hit the button and held it for two

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
hit the button and held it for two
seconds<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.650> activate<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> system

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
seconds to actually activate the system

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.270 
seconds to actually activate the system
and<00:01:41.880> lock<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.829> we're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> do

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and lock it in what we're going to do

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
and lock it in what we're going to do
now<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.460> hold<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> past<00:01:45.240> those<00:01:45.540> four<00:01:45.840> beeps<00:01:46.140> for

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
now is hold it past those four beeps for

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
now is hold it past those four beeps for
an<00:01:46.829> additional<00:01:47.009> three<00:01:47.520> seconds<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> listen
