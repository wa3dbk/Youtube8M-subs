00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.239
 attached it to double sided tape 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.850
 which comes complete with 3 m so to speak 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.830
 forever this is the picture we have here 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.400
 such a viewing angle is quite large 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.729
 on the menu we are all here in bulk 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.130
 Kherson will show you talk constantly with 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.840
 You are a woman in Russian here 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.430
 front camera setting here 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.349
 rear camera setting here 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.419
 memory allocation 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.910
 touch screen is ok at all 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.530
 works without claims 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.479
 memory allocation because 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.400
 DVR can write as on 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.710
 parking lot 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.930
 in parking mode and in normal recording 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.190
 there is a distribution how much to write 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.110
 to memory card 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.630
 I hope you can see it because the sun is on 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.330
 street also from system settings 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.229
 speaker backlight menu button 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.300
 gdr sensitivity this changes then 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.610
 eat at night i don't test 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.560
 opportunities because you can stay 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.440
 without a car you know perfectly well 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.300
 what is the situation now with us 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.220
 no less I think it will be clear in the afternoon 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.740
 picture of such a DVR 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.919
 Iâ€™m not going to do much in principle 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.660
 get tired because a woman said 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.580
 what's coming video 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.470
 that's because no one really 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.900
 understands these settings home 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.000
 the picture that you already see she 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.130
 of course a little wait because 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.639
 we will mount the whole thing we have it 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.800
 I think 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.010
 the result will be decent drove 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.010
 ride 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.090
 I did not connect the antenna gps but because 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:40.500
 we do not have these radar cameras Russia 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.500
 we have frames there 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.340
 test sample test 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.620
 some kind of garbage can somewhere drove 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.449
 Sadly, you know, so I strongly 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:04.629
 I don't take it seriously because 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.870
 DVR was sent a review not from 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.870
 the store 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.980
 and we will certainly evaluate it not as 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.530
 in the shop 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.350
 just the truth that you see in principle me 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.520
 until everything pleases except the price of course the price 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.470
 he has a huge 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.400
 but I think I'll watch the video I have not seen 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:40.440
 video 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:40.440
