00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.989
 on clash of clouds not that things 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.940
 commercial that everyone post and who 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.039

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.159
 very advanced strategy so congratulations to 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.100
 you and suddenly to thank you already for 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.719
 to have supported it from the beginning and a good 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.069
 replay from you that you gave me and 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.549
 that I will have the pleasure of 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.219
 comment 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.569
 it's a beautiful replay pig golem 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.909
 so rice knows very well the strategy 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.369
 for which I made a guide and he 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.639
 apply there being a big modo a hdv 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.579
 nine at the very beginning of ES9 since it has 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:07.420
 that the queen against in hd vnf that also 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.039
 in early May with a queen level 2 the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.109
 bombs and we only have level pigs 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.329
 4 for ice so there is a real challenge 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.329
 there on the attack and again where 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.750
 you know that 90% of the success of a 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.670
 attack is based on his preparation 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.289
 so we're talking about golem pig yes but 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.509
 a golem pig a bit peculiar 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.700
 since we have 7 7 balloons why 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.350
 this balloon because we see that in 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.249
 the drawing of the village is whole there 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.439
 are not brought in October this is 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.390
 defense here in water are not brought 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.530
 the whole they are imported on 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.780
 clan castle that will be going out 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.469
 on the other hand if you drop roughly 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.479
 two balloons on each defense you 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.189
 will almost be able to kill them when 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.479
 we can invest as little space for 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.110
 you defend it you have to do it even if you 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.660
 make a pig golem 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.220
 balloons on buildings gratos he 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.990
 you have to sacrifice it you have to 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.790
 do it well worth it because 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.520
 that's it tomorrow for your golem 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.250
 destroyed 1 at the end so first part 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.660
 the attak go out castle this clan and so 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.360
 to have buildings destroyed 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.610
 for that we use bullets have 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.090
 Then we have 18 golem pig and 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.160
 witches of a clan leader 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.690
 a few distraction troops here for 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.530
 avoid witches being taken for 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.610
 target by defensive chÃ¢teaulin content 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.620
 wizards and you'll see 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.950
 intelligence is that we have both 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.150
 the queen who could be boring late 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.370
 you must always be a queen when 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.110
 we do a take piggy golem so he 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.940
 have to kill the queen for her break we're out 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.360
 of care to end up jumping up if we drop 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 a golem here with our queen and 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.620
 some witches and where reiss is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.970
 smart is that the second 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.910
 beleyme rather than sacrificing it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.530
 also on the arena he will use it 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.600
 on the other side since the village is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.549
 completely symmetrical to kill the king 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.430
 with some wizard and the advantage 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.360
 is because he will have a golem of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.340
 each side of the village 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.870
 we will occupy a lot of defense on 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.299
 the golems while the pigs at the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.970
 be able to clean the village from below 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.830
 going back up gradually and in 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.910
 managing the healing spells on the village 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.970
 I am a little space to explain 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.489
 that when we have our mouth mi6 and the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.950
 second tier mi6 you will have art 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.200
 kicks the two x arcs that will be attracted 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.450
 by the golems you will have his tricks 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.220
 of wizards who are really dangerous 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.140
 for pigs who will also be in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.250
 pulling on the shutter and not 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.600
 need to go further from this 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.220
 moment there when you drew so much 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.630
 defense on you no need to try 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.820
 to break walls or lay a center 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.860
 of sow the goal of the golems his tanks and there 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.480
 they will do it and that means that for 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.280
 the pigs that will be deposited here in 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.019
 down there will be only defenses 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.890
 individuals who will shoot at them and 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.170
 so even if you talk about it 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.360
 some of them will change 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.220
 not much on the issue so if 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.480
 you take a wizard's tower she 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.610
 can you smoke the pigs very 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.770
 quickly so 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.980
 very beautiful very beautiful preparation of 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:17.510
 attack and very nice execution also 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.570
 so go balloons that are dropped 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.840
 in water as planned to try a 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.310
 maximum to kill the defenses while 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.350
 leaving the clan castle because it is 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.120
 find that it's the top of the village that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.460
 is trapped 1 but hey we can not 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.250
 know the advanced and despite all that we 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.630
 invests 7 balloons we still killed 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.040
 two output defenses the castle to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.090
 to throw is one at all 3 defense 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.710
 now we attract the content 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.050
 both clans outward from the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.510
 village with a barbarian it is necessary especially 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.580
 started by asking your barbarian and not 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.870
 the witches still a barbarian for the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.300
 hold a little further now a 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.700
 market here we will be able to move to 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.740
 cleaning is obscure so years of 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.910
 markets that are asked ok excuse us 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.380
 we had a dragon in the castle of 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.630
 clans in the singer think that very 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.430
 well to clean a castle this plan that 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.650
 goes very well wizards have the advantage 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.210
 it is that she continues to serve you 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.470
 since once you go kill that 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.169
 document you can continue to move forward 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.090
 with the skeletons that it generates 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.550
 pose the golem his goal is to go 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.830
 look for the defenses and attract the 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.780
 fire of the queen on him the queen that is 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 level 1 will do the job is on the other 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.430
 side was seeing the golem was filed of 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.990
 symmetric way and leroy our king 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.600
 level 10 will take care of the defensive king 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.160
 and during that time we put down the 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.780
 pigs from the bottom all the defenses 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.820
 which are a little bit difficult to 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.940
 master are busy on the golems 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.919
 the two arcs x when many lives 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.630
 the towers of wizards that background that 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.010
 have them clean in parallel and see that 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.360
 pigs almost unaffected 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.310
 in hadj is cleaned half of 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.860
 defenses continued to rise in 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.130
 village laid without any care 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.510
 to put on a stormy evening we could have 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.950
 take care of yourself and I love 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.630
 well the pigs sense of care and 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.880
 not the rage but it's a 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.169
 question of personal choice and finally he 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.390
 remains more than the top of the village to 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.700
 to clean a bomb explodes two bombs 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.320
 explode but not at all this palace 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.560
 double bomb so no risk for them 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.820
 pigs and we finished with the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.290
 maintenance and cleaning defenses 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.470
 so very nice attack because we are 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.090
 on a cloud that never 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.400
 the nine with articles we have that 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.360
 pig 4 again when you 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.430
 prepare the tac 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.460
 if you run it right behind 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.280
 it's billiards in time we were a 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.290
 little limit but it's normal we only have 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.540
 pigs 4 we would like low level nke 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.860
 if we had had pigs 5 we would have 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.710
 already finished cleaning the village 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.390
 we still have a lot more but 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.370
 Ben Bravo it's a feat when we have 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.960
 bought saves me from m 3 stars supernate 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.270
 and nine cantons to the queen and the arches x 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.940
 in defense it's really very strong 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.320
 here are the friends it's over yet 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.730

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.560

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.210
 good info on the troubles boom and 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.800
 it's someone who has an approach and 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.570
