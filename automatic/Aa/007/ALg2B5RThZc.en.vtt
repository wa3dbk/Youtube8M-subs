00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.580
 well in today's strategy we are going to 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.579
 talk about the stochastic indicator as 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.190
 You see it is very simple to understand and 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.789
 use and it is also a very system 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.789
 profitable 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.980
 the stochastic indicator is facilitated 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.480
 by the graphics of evolution of values 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 that are displayed on the www money page 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.180
 river internet dot net which is the one 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.730
 are you now 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.730
 To do this, add the indicator 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.030
 plastic text 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.079
 to do this press this button here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.499
 here we have it expanded 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.250
 and we see a picture like this in 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:47.469
 this box you have to click on 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.479
 stochastic and this will add us the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.049
 indicated of plastic gesture to the graph 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.049
 of evolution 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.490
 here we have the evolution graph 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.930
 and as you can see in the part here 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.640
 below we have been added 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.640
 the stochastic indicator 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 now let's talk about the rules 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.550
 as you know or understand beds or see 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 although it 's all here is the indicator 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.180
 Stochastic 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.140
 here has marked a high zone and an area 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.700
 low the high zone and the low zone is 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 bounded by this dotted line 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 what is here in this color the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.870
 evolution of value and what we have to 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.400
 search that is in the high zone that has 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:41.060
 a crossing of the red and blue line or in the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.080
 low area when we see a crossing of the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 red lines in blue in the high zone 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.510
 we will invest to the downside in a term of 15 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.590
 20 minutes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.370
 on the contrary if you cross the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.990
 blue and red line in the low area 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.110
 we invest upwards in a term of 15 to 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.520
 20 minutes 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.730
 This is the simple and effective 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.640
 crossing in the high zone we invest to the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.150
 low 15 to 20 minutes crossing in the area 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.060
 low 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.640
 we invest to the upside of 15 to 20 minutes if 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.210
 there is no crossing in the high zone or in 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.150
 the low we do not invest 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.820
 and now I'm going to give you an example of how 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.430
 is used now that we already knew the theory 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.920
 let's make an example we are in the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.920
 Evolution section of web values 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.079
 here we click on this button not you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.760
 explained a few seconds ago and 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.760
 we select this casting 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.690
 and the perfect stochastic appears 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.690
 here we see google have just crossed 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.989
 a few moments ago the blue and red line 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.810
 so as he will go down and we go 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.340
 to do this operation 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.610
 we would see the block now I have six thousand 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.610
 583 euros 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.840
 and I'm going to invest in google down 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.480
 see and voting 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.700
 now it's 1613 here is google 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.640
 we have said to the downside and I will invest 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.840
 500 euros 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.840
 we press business 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.600
 and until the open operation 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.670
 as it is now 4 and 13 and ends at 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.620
 4:30 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.190
 I'm going to press the video until I miss a 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.910
 minute 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.910
 well it's already 4 and 28 here we have the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.130
 operation this is the marked price 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.040
 when we have done the operation and this 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.800
 is the current market is clearly 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:17.780
 to the downside and therefore in this operation 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:21.700
 we will have a benefit of 490 euros 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.280
 while we wait for it to end 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.830
 I remind you that it is very simple we have 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.650
 that go graph by graph and we're going 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.650
 adding the stochastic indicator 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.619
 or you can see for example in this graph 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.749
 what is the apple 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:42.389
 here there is no operation to be carried out since 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:45.020
 are not crossing in the high zone or 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.020
 the low 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:54.679
 the evolution section of added values to 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.329
 all graphs the stochastic and one 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:58.219
 Once we have it added, it is not necessary 

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.279
 that you come during the day the graphs 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.649
 they are evolving in real time and with 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.610
 just observe the ones for example every 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:10.159
 15 minutes or every 30 so you can 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.110
 discover when there are crosses here by 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.659
 exxon mobile example is not there either 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.419
 operation at the moment but you can 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.559
 leave this open until it occurs 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.849
 some crossing in this area or this area 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.849
 there are many indicators 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.850
 here are the best ones that are in the 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.600
 most trading platforms 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.800
 let's see how much is left 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.800
 and to the point of ending 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.650
 it's already four thirty and the anointing already 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.569
 has overcome this sometimes has a little 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.550
 of delay 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.550
 so we wait for it to end 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.170
 but this is an operation with a 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.170
 benefit of 490 euros 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.000
 and ends 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.490
 and we are also updates the balance 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.460
 ansaldo have subtracted the 500 euros from 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.280
 the operation therefore is now in 6 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.170
 thousand 83 when we have started work in 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.170
 6 thousand 583 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.860
 the operation appeared to them and we have to 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.950
 wait a few minutes until about 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:31.440
 seconds is already outdated as 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:34.009
 you can see we already have 6,973 a benefit 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.779
 of 490 euros 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.389
 and this is the strategy of the 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.059
 stochastics you can use it since it is 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.900
 a very powerful strategy we see ourselves in 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.900
 the next video
