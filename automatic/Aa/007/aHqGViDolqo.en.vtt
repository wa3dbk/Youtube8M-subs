hard<00:00:58.230> drive<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.829> simple<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.370> if<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
hard drive it's pretty simple so if you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
hard drive it's pretty simple so if you
don't<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
don't know how to do that then you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.049 
don't know how to do that then you
probably<00:01:02.070> shouldn't<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.640> watching<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
probably shouldn't be watching this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
probably shouldn't be watching this
video<00:01:03.270> yet<00:01:04.140> maybe<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.280> find<00:01:05.489> tutorial

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
video yet maybe you can go find tutorial

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.410 
video yet maybe you can go find tutorial
elsewhere<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.909> basically<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> want<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

you can edit it anything you want up to
a<00:01:26.700> certain<00:01:26.939> point<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.360> believe<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> would

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
a certain point I believe I would

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.359 
a certain point I believe I would
recommend<00:01:28.920> doing<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.340> nine<00:01:30.000> 9's<00:01:30.390> meaning

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
recommend doing all nine 9's meaning

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.490 
recommend doing all nine 9's meaning
like<00:01:32.659> 999<00:01:33.659> million<00:01:35.479> yeah<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> maximum

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
like 999 million yeah that's the maximum

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
like 999 million yeah that's the maximum
I<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.759> think<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> game<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I don't think the game will go over that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
I don't think the game will go over that
before<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.350> game<00:01:40.530> itself<00:01:40.770> corrupts<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.400> yeah

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
before your game itself corrupts so yeah

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.050 
before your game itself corrupts so yeah
make<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.810> maximum<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.820> after<00:01:44.820> doing

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
make that your maximum and after doing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.770 
make that your maximum and after doing
that<00:01:45.740> well<00:01:46.740> actually<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.360> add<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that well actually you can you can add a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
that well actually you can you can add a
lot<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.259> statistics<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> don't

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
lot of your statistics here if you don't

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990 
lot of your statistics here if you don't
want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.280> don't<00:01:53.280> recommend<00:01:53.759> doing

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
want to do that I don't recommend doing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.660 
want to do that I don't recommend doing
too<00:01:54.600> much<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.829> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> throw<00:01:56.549> off

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
too much that would kind of throw off

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.410 
too much that would kind of throw off
the<00:01:56.820> game<00:01:57.030> interface<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.649> uh<00:01:59.420> basically

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the game interface but uh basically

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.200 
the game interface but uh basically
you're<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.049> save<00:02:01.759> sound<00:02:02.759> should<00:02:02.969> pop<00:02:03.180> up

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you're gonna save sound should pop up

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.469 
you're gonna save sound should pop up
sounding<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> xbox360<00:02:04.950> nxe<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:06.299> sound

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
