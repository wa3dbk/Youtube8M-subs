00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 great to surprise who you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 you want let's start with some cases 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.690
 phone and these in particular I've 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 others more normal what you're going to 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 need are a cover of your phone 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.190
 that or the phone that you are going to give away 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.410
 tail this is from outside that is 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.270
 heavier I'm going to use some tips 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 pastry bag in this case in the form of 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.749
 star of different types of ornament 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.819
 that I'll be hitting is worth what we have to 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.399
 to go doing is to put this sleeve 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:41.539
 star shaped pastry in your 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.909
 in all the fontaine the whole base and chupi 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.289
 pots but like little points is worth more or 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.239
 less so then when you have it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.339
 before it dries begins to put 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.199

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.160
 triangle up and down with what you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.690
 you want and then on top you will add a 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.550
 touch of glitter 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.870
 ready to give've done 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.600
 different types of covers I have made 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.850
 others that have a little more than 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 Christmas touch with some Christmas magnets 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 and a little bit of glitter and they're super 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.690
 well you can give it to your best 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 friend your sister who you want are 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.010
 great and then decorate as you want 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.390
 the next thing to know let's go to be 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.970
 cups I'm going to make them from two types of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 forms using two types of products on 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.290
 first thing I'm going to use is going to be good 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.120
 I will use a blank cup I will use 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490
 in this case products to the clinic 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.980
 acrylic acrylic colors a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.690
 brushes that can be pulled and a 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.260
 little bit of alcohol first thing we're going to 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.610
 do it to clean the entire cup of 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.670
 possible grease you have of our 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.470
 hands with alcohol I'll catch on this 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.660
 design some ribbon paper 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 whole carton that is paper is tape 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.260
 of paper and we're going to give it on the handle for 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.620
 create a ribbon effect around the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.899
 I will paint the house and add the 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.400
 drawing in this case to put happy day 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.660
 but you can add the one you want what 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.070
 What else do you feel like? 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 that motivate you of pretty drawings in 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 this case I have drawn of the two in the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.190
 two zones in the two parts of the cup 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.570
 but you can draw wherever you want 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.530
 even inside because as we go 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.270
 to cook the color will remain stuck 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 these are the first two that I have done 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.630
 with acrylic and now I'm going to use 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 show you the flowers I have made with the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.470
 markers we are going to do 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.600
 exactly the same clean it with 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.100
 all cotton cup and let's start 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.260
 create the design that you want in this 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.330
 case I used some golden markers and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 silver so you have a little more 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.730
 festive touch since I love the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 Christmas and this is what I finish 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 the end and back will give you a few 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.780
 little touches with little hearts 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.880
 silver and what we have to do 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.160
 now we have to take these cups 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.890
 and put them in your oven for 30 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.120
 minutes cook them and you will be in the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.340
 paint fixed to the cup the last one is is 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 a goblet of pencils or brushes 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.510
 as you want you need a glass without 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 I draw a little tail the drawings that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 want to translate I'm going to make some 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.110
 snowflakes 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.209
 and a little tape to stick it for 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 inside now you see how and the paint that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.140
 you want me to want I have drawn 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.000
 some snowflakes and what I'm going to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.680
 make is inside the glass stick them 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.930
 with this ribbon to be my guides 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.060
 ok you can make hearts letters what 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.540
 you want what I most want 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.430
 I'm going to make three snowflakes in this 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.959
 case I have caught a tail that is 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.209
 too liquid if you had one that 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.920
 out more consistent would be better what 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.450
 let's do is start to trace the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.450
 I draw on top of our glass 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.650
 there came a point where it was too much 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.810
 liquid then what I did was with the 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.700
 stick of these of skewer moruno 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.500
 draw the rest of the stars and 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.810
 is a little better now what 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.700
 we're going to do is paint the whole glass already 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.120
 you will see how beautiful is an effect 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.190
 of precious relief I see how it is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.050
 super festive in silver but you can 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.670
 use the color you want white red 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.070
 the one you like the most and look at what 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.720
 nice is how easy it is and that 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.310
 striking is this goblet you can 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.010
 use then for what you want as I say 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.930
 pencils pencils and that's a gift or 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.290
 a super nice decoration I think it's 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.290
 cool 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.370

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.760
