00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 and it's just okay that you guys think 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 job on again 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 and this time the dragon actually really 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 important to you take're released 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.510
 but beauty I had to do this 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 video today I can not very important 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.580
 on the channel sony play something that will me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.420
 100% help with my work here at 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.279
 youtube 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 How do you know you blame him after all? 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.730
 as much as my blog I already 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 I stay weeks and record videos week if 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 posting video is already for example the message 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 correctly to defoe far cry from 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 and the reason is the computer. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.539
 I was with a computer that was not 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 Very good I was having serious problems. 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.550
 It's been a long time recording the video. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 not editing a video is something that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 It took me three weeks to edit one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 video for example of factoid is the fec tá 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.910
 delaying because of it then the fec 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.010
 mobile already owns when it was this video 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 okay but these things made me 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.270
 housing edit computer locking no 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 I could record games on a computer 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 Because you're not good I recorded 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.330
 a precision three with red after 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.979
 to edit and it's something that gives me 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 much because the kind of editing I 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.430
 I do I just did adobe heavyweights do not give 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.570
 The answer that I needed then is me. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 I'm here to announce my 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 partnership with the North League games with 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 company that opened my arms nor 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 a real machine 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990
 I will show you that it professes configuration and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.970
 it is with great happiness that I do not know just 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 partnership because staff on the internet 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
 both the student was guilherme's wife 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 who is the owner of via net they sent me 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.600
 super cool me it 's open opportunity to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.659
 We shot the multiplayer space them 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.909
 and this partnership came on time 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.990
 spectacular and it will not be just that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.970
 people will show many events that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.430
 they always make so much of it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.649
 possibly the webjet we are already seeing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.619
 this is then a sharing that came 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.509
 even great in fafe tool that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.710
 They gave me this computer here. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.580
 main hand machine 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.470
 going very well mounted they are seeing there 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.929
 It's really pretty even and I'm here with 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.270
 the boxes that is to show you the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.430
 What is it about him? 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.140
 let the hearts of computers not 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.550
 was that the cooler is monster with several 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.220
 heatsinks 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.410
 talked nice to be able to cool because the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.130
 A bull has a bull and in there I am 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.580
 talking about a bulldozer fx 66 thousand and 100 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.950
 is a very good amd processor it has 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.769
 six - core fx 6,000 essence can 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.350
 look for there is a very good processor is 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.660
 he and the flex family is the ricardo has it 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.190
 a little more powerful than mine but is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.690
 the processor is great for anyone 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.489
 edit videos for those who work with 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.630
 games that require a lot of 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.330
 computer, right? 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.860
 and pushing will suffice here 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.459
 It is a top processor in processor 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 bulldozer six core fx 6,100 amd 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.810
 very good we have here also what 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.680
 comanda is a motherboard of gigabyte one 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.070
 another of the vulture forum is the classic line 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.670
 78 mts2 né for the lovers is a 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.049
 board a good motherboard is not so in 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.090
 any of the best 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.650
 gigabyte a motherboard that has a cost 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.110
 very good because it is a benefit right 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 light plate a good plate and if it says that 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.220
 it is a durable board it has a system 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.590
 that as she speaks has protection problems 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.730
 against moisture protection against static 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.440
 It's very important for you not to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 ends here but for your computer 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.579
 is a protection against power failure 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.810
 which also burns much right computer and 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.459
 protection against high temperature 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
 because like my computer 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.750
 it has a fx processor if you do not 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.250
 have a very good experiment and finish 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 overheating your computer and also 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.420
 burning of components and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.250
 This is what we want to avoid. 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.350
 so there's a lot of expensive board 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.810
 and it is sufficient because I 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.829
 I need the excellent door then let's go 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.220
 here is used since hds a visage 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:03.519
 which are 500 gigs and I have an HD 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.410
 on this computer are two hds of 351 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.400
 500gb I want to buy another day 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.049
 all because I do not want 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.940
 problems with space because one of the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.889
 Big problems even talked to Ricardo 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.230
 is that the ps did not have more space in the 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.659
 local disk if I could not 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.859
 lineu adobe so this one gives me a lot 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.060
 problem does not want to have more problem with 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.829
 hd 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.150
 this one here guys my video card 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.130
 it's a law of a hd 6670 walking thinking 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.030
 it was something else but this charge 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.660
 is that the model heidi hd 6670 of 1 gb 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.970
 amd ddr3 also i got this board 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.010
 of amd precisely because of my 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.650
 processor whatever my processor 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.600
 it already emulates a video card so 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.520
 with this sapphire video card is a 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
 where he's going to make a classic is 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.300
 make it much faster because they will 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.680
 work together 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.630
 see also question so they are 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.120
 because I choose I'll get a sign 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.650
 video and gave me some geforce 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.720
 I always talk about your defended area. 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.789
 processor on your motherboard do you want 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.470
 a computer running from then on 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.300
 you bought parts brands 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.490
 similar things that will be done to 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.229
 working together then it's like everything very much 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.330
 well thought out league staff this afternoon 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.100
 Congratulations, the computer thought it was 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.590
 work together that could put the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.410
 focus and strengthens the amd processor that 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.720
 run fine but it would not spin at its maximum 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.610
 could run better then this 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.630
 set here do not do much work 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.580
 well and here along my HD also and 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.550
 we here is what will give strength to 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.650
 This, I do not have a game source. 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.020
 max which is a very good source of 500 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.310
 watts that will already help the hell is 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.400
 a source of revenue for the computer 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.380
 she is a strong 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.840
 Puel, it 's just to be able to give an insured 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.849
 she is 500 watts but she will suffer 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.320
 very well because I do not need 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.950
 I have another video card has a card 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.919
 video only that my 6670 hd already 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.479
 It'll be great and that's how it goes. 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.310
 be more like a plant than the 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.130
 my memory that the 8gb memory of 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.870
 kingston too and will help a lot 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.300
 because now how do I have a video card? 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.590
 memory and not depending on the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.800
 processor that is to be able to push 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.330
 All right folks this is it is only 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.830
 I configured it on my computer. 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.419

 Can I take a look at him leaving 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.910
 better components buying more 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.950
