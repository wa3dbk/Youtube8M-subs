00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 how much I like to prepare breakfast with 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.140
 alternative sweets and today I got it 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.420
 cue from the american breakfast 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.490
 offering you the pancakes it is about 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.250
 small delicious pancakes that of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 usually get ready with a lot of man 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 a lot of burano a lot of sugar 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
 today, however, none of this because 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.850
 we will make them a lighter face without 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 gluten without boom is pure without sugar 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.369
 in the dough what will be the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.830
 alternative ingredients 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.969
 discover it with me ingredients for 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.059
 6 7 pancakes 100 g of rice flour 100 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.399
 g of banana pulp an egg a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.760
 teaspoon of baking powder in 90 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 grams of Greek yogurt 50 mm of milk a 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 pinch of salt for cooking 2 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.789
 tablespoons of oil to serve as desired 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.410
 serious syrup and more this recipe 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 I like it a lot because it can be prepared 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 even at the last minute maybe at 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 morning we wake up we do not know that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 what to prepare for breakfast and there 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.979
 let's just take three minutes an hour or 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.990
 peeled it works but weighed 100 g of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.780
 pulp and with the prongs of the fork 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:17.479
 I reduce everything to a puree in a bowl 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.479
 let's now get together with rice flour 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 let's add a he Greek hogwarts that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.990
 will be our butter substitute 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.750
 then we can add some milk to taste 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 be pure milk cow's milk 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.850
 vegetable if you prefer an egg we mix 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.440
 and add the banana 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.440
 the advice to choose bananas 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.479
 ripe that are rather sugary 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.810
 because as you noticed in the dough 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.170
 I didn't add sugar as well 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 I add a pinch of salt not 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.100
 too much mix as the last ingredient 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.509
 we also add a teaspoon of 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 baking powder 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 naturally gluten-free if you do the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.040
 I recommend the recipe for coeliacs 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.250
 always check in the packaging that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.739
 let there be the mark of the crossed ear ho 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 put to heat a pan 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.560
 I add a trickle of used oil 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.420
 I distribute peanut oil a little 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.110
 you see I have put half 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.239
 very little teaspoon this is the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.830
 consistency of batter topics which 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.400
 you see they are the banana lumps 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.000
 let's take a spoonful of the mixture in 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.709
 lower it directly on the pan 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.100
 let's get some warmth let's make gods 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.100
 risks 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.900
 let's do it a little at a time 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.460
 we keep a moderate flame and when 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.050
 we feel that the crust has formed 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.390
 below we can turn it over with the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.730
 heat now you can see that the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.500
 pancakes swells plan their own plan 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.500
 due to the presence of yeast inside 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.470
 now let's see if it was formed from 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.570
 crust is still rather delicate 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.430
 let's see if we can turn it over 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.840
 quickly so 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.140
 we wait a little longer because you see 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.200
 that the fund is still quite clear 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.180
 I waited about another 30 seconds, see 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.760
 i also turn out much better i 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.110
 pancakes and made a crust 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.390
 light golden light 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 wait about another minute 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.380
 and a half and then we renew it we proceed 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.550
 in this way until all of them are exhausted 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.210
 pa stars I managed to get a 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.040
 10 pancakes very well we see mine 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.790
 idea of presentation or I am flat 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.610
 my stacked as tradition requires 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.040
 then we can put some syrup 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.530
 from agave or maple though you can though 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.330
 safely also do without it 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.430
 however, bananas are already sugary 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:24.040
 we put ourselves on top of them for a while 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.780
 dwellings that I put with lemon 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.120
 they have all fallen but it doesn't matter 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.590
 good breakfast for everyone to start the 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.460
 day on the right foot and with the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.460
 grit of a lion 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.640
 they have all fallen but it doesn't matter 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.640
 here
