consists of one yo-yo and it has a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.050 
consists of one yo-yo and it has a
butterfly<00:02:34.500> wing<00:02:34.740> shape<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> bearing<00:02:35.730> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
butterfly wing shape with the bearing so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
butterfly wing shape with the bearing so
yeah<00:02:36.210> if<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.420> could<00:02:36.540> spin<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.010> sorry<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.070> it's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
yeah if you could spin it sorry if it's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.620 
yeah if you could spin it sorry if it's
bad<00:02:38.520> when<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.300> string

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
bad when you can do like that string

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.340 
bad when you can do like that string
tricks<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.370> when<00:02:42.120> two<00:02:42.600> yarders<00:02:42.960> are<00:02:43.140> once

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
tricks to a is when two yarders are once

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.620 
tricks to a is when two yarders are once
and<00:02:43.710> they're<00:02:43.890> round<00:02:44.130> shapes<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.610> plastic<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
and they're round shapes in plastic so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.480 
and they're round shapes in plastic so
that<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:46.140> they<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:46.680> something<00:02:46.950> called<00:02:47.100> auto

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
that if they have something called auto

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.580 
that if they have something called auto
return<00:02:47.910> when<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.750> comes<00:02:48.930> straight<00:02:49.200> back<00:02:49.260> up

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
return when it comes straight back up

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.190 
return when it comes straight back up
after<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.980> throw<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> throw<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.790> right

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
after you throw it if you throw it right

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.570 
after you throw it if you throw it right
with<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.320> advantage<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.070> throw<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
with this advantage you can throw it and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.980 
with this advantage you can throw it and
then<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.000> could<00:02:54.150> come<00:02:54.330> back<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:54.870> you

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
then you could come back and then you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.230 
then you could come back and then you
could<00:02:55.140> do<00:02:55.260> something<00:02:55.290> called<00:02:55.800> looping<00:02:56.240> and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
could do something called looping and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.240 
could do something called looping and
then<00:02:57.360> three<00:02:57.660> eight<00:02:57.870> consists<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.620> two<00:02:59.070> yo-yos

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
then three eight consists of two yo-yos

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.830 
then three eight consists of two yo-yos
also<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.180> two<00:03:00.300> string<00:03:00.630> trick

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
also but these are two string trick

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.990 
also but these are two string trick
yo-yos<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:02.010> can<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> dance<00:03:02.730> string

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
yo-yos so you can do a dance string

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.180 
yo-yos so you can do a dance string
tricks<00:03:03.300> but<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:04.020> two<00:03:04.290> guys<00:03:04.440> at<00:03:04.709> once

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
tricks but with two guys at once

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.500 
tricks but with two guys at once
four<00:03:06.180> eight<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:07.310> also<00:03:08.310> another<00:03:08.850> spin<00:03:09.300> trick

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
four eight is also another spin trick

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.540 
four eight is also another spin trick
you<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.260> comes<00:03:10.440> off<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.980> string<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
you like it comes off the string and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.400 
you like it comes off the string and
it's<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> bit<00:03:12.180> larger<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.930> can<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.170> advanced

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
it's a bit larger so you can do advanced

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.350 
it's a bit larger so you can do advanced
string<00:03:13.709> tricks<00:03:13.980> while<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:14.790> coming<00:03:15.060> off<00:03:15.209> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
string tricks while it's coming off the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.510 
string tricks while it's coming off the
string<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.410> last<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:17.070> called<00:03:17.220> five

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
string and the last one it's called five

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.760 
string and the last one it's called five
a<00:03:17.700> supply<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.440> one<00:03:19.650> day<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
a supply the a is just like one day a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.220 
a supply the a is just like one day a
looming<00:03:20.250> except<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.120> counterweight<00:03:21.540> at

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
looming except it has a counterweight at

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.170 
looming except it has a counterweight at
the<00:03:22.410> side<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.520> can<00:03:23.760> swing<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.060> around

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
the side so now you can swing it around

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.199 
the side so now you can swing it around
where<00:03:24.480> you're<00:03:24.570> doing<00:03:24.750> advanced<00:03:25.050> string<00:03:25.380> six

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
where you're doing advanced string six

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.570 
where you're doing advanced string six
the<00:03:27.209> most<00:03:27.450> common<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.410> yoyo<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.280> people

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the most common of yoyo like that people

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.690 
the most common of yoyo like that people
use<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.480> actually<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:31.530> point<00:03:31.830> now<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> way

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
use is actually one point now the way

use is actually one point now the way
the<00:03:32.850> 1a<00:03:33.060> yo-yo<00:03:33.330> works<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.050> has<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> couple<00:03:34.470> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
the 1a yo-yo works is it has a couple of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.550 
the 1a yo-yo works is it has a couple of
parts<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.040> has<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.459> string<00:03:36.200> as<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.320> can<00:03:37.440> see

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
parts it has the string as you can see

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.100 
parts it has the string as you can see
here<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> has<00:03:38.239> two<00:03:39.239> yo-yos<00:03:39.480> shells<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.049> they

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
here it has two yo-yos shells and they

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.320 
here it has two yo-yos shells and they
both<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.530> things<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.489> them<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.060> they<00:03:42.180> have

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
both have things in them so they have

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.560 
both have things in them so they have
the<00:03:42.510> ball<00:03:42.720> bearing<00:03:43.140> which<00:03:43.470> spins<00:03:43.860> where<00:03:44.850> the

game<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.760> moment<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.420> front<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
game this is the moment in front of the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.509 
game this is the moment in front of the
yo-yo<00:03:55.140> if<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.440> don't<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.830> response<00:03:56.250> pass

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
yo-yo if you don't have a response pass

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.270 
yo-yo if you don't have a response pass
and<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> yo-yo<00:03:57.000> can't<00:03:57.390> come<00:03:57.660> back<00:03:57.810> up<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:59.130> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and the yo-yo can't come back up so the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
and the yo-yo can't come back up so the
way<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.459> put<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> yo-yo<00:04:00.090> together<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:01.530> you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
way you put the yo-yo together is you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.800 
way you put the yo-yo together is you
put<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.100> string<00:04:02.310> on<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.330> take<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.660> two

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
put the string on you take the two

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.180 
put the string on you take the two
halves<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:05.430> screw<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.850> together<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.780> so

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
halves and you screw it together like so

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.180 
halves and you screw it together like so
and<00:04:08.190> then<00:04:08.760> that's<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.150> yo-yo

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and then that's the yo-yo

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.440 
and then that's the yo-yo
