let's<00:02:01.500> talk<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.189> performance<00:02:02.579> Louise

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
let's talk about that performance Louise

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.510 
let's talk about that performance Louise
what<00:02:03.719> does<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
what does this have so this is going to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.960 
what does this have so this is going to
have<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.170> intel<00:02:07.170> core<00:02:07.409> i7<00:02:07.590> processor<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.759> right

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
there dedicated nvidia graphics card

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.570 
there dedicated nvidia graphics card
hello<00:02:18.840> okay<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.170> we've<00:02:19.380> got<00:02:19.530> an<00:02:19.680> intel<00:02:20.070> core<00:02:20.280> i7

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
hello okay so we've got an intel core i7

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
hello okay so we've got an intel core i7
correct<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.390> an<00:02:21.690> nvidia<00:02:22.050> graphics<00:02:22.620> card

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
correct and an nvidia graphics card

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.530 
correct and an nvidia graphics card
correct<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.550> not<00:02:23.670> intel<00:02:24.060> accelerated

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
correct so it's not intel accelerated

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.080 
correct so it's not intel accelerated
graphics<00:02:24.660> which<00:02:24.990> are<00:02:25.080> also<00:02:25.170> very<00:02:25.470> good<00:02:25.620> to

samsung with hi-def screen we already

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.680 
samsung with hi-def screen we already
know<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.860> their<00:02:32.130> TVs<00:02:32.520> are<00:02:32.820> rock<00:02:33.390> star

into<00:02:37.020> laptops<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
into laptops and you you really make a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
into laptops and you you really make a
great<00:02:39.000> point<00:02:39.240> because<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> fact<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.320> have

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
great point because of the fact we have

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
great point because of the fact we have
those<00:02:40.710> TV<00:02:40.980> divisions<00:02:41.370> because<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.210> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
those TV divisions because we have so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.630 
those TV divisions because we have so
many<00:02:42.630> divisions<00:02:43.500> where<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.830> are<00:02:44.100> we're

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
many divisions where we are we're

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 
many divisions where we are we're
borrowing<00:02:45.120> from<00:02:45.330> those<00:02:45.510> now<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.020> being<00:02:46.410> able

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
borrowing from those now and being able

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.650 
borrowing from those now and being able
to<00:02:46.710> take<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.040> great<00:02:47.280> TV<00:02:47.520> technology<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.330> put

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
to take that great TV technology and put

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.330 
to take that great TV technology and put
it<00:02:48.750> into<00:02:48.900> something<00:02:49.170> that's<00:02:49.380> mobile<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it into something that's mobile so this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.750 
it into something that's mobile so this
screen<00:02:50.700> has<00:02:51.120> 16<00:02:51.990> million<00:02:52.530> colors<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
screen has 16 million colors in it and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.970 
screen has 16 million colors in it and
for<00:02:54.150> depth<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.080> basically<00:02:55.620> what<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.800> means

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
for depth so basically what that means

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.540 
for depth so basically what that means
is<00:02:56.430> instead<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:57.090> standard<00:02:57.630> 256k<00:02:58.620> i<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:59.400> it's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
is instead of standard 256k i know it's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.460 
is instead of standard 256k i know it's
a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.880> numbers<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.270> more<00:03:00.840> colors<00:03:01.170> means

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
a lot of numbers but more colors means

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.740 
a lot of numbers but more colors means
better<00:03:02.010> color<00:03:02.310> representations<00:03:03.270> means<00:03:03.600> your

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
better color representations means your

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.360 
better color representations means your
photos<00:03:04.110> look<00:03:04.290> more<00:03:04.500> real<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.860> videos<00:03:05.250> look

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
photos look more real your videos look

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
photos look more real your videos look
more<00:03:05.760> real<00:03:06.000> maybe<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.540> gaming<00:03:06.780> looks<00:03:07.170> more

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
more real maybe your gaming looks more

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.410 
more real maybe your gaming looks more
real<00:03:07.560> whatever<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.250> may<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.430> you're<00:03:09.090> going<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
real whatever it may be you're going to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.970 
real whatever it may be you're going to
get<00:03:09.510> better<00:03:09.720> color<00:03:10.020> saturation<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.740> there<00:03:10.860> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
get better color saturation on there and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.890 
get better color saturation on there and
then<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.340> brightness<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> screen<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.570> it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
then the brightness on the screen to it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.120 
then the brightness on the screen to it
just<00:03:13.110> makes<00:03:13.260> everything<00:03:13.380> pop<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.980> makes

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
just makes everything pop it makes

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.100 
just makes everything pop it makes
everything<00:03:14.460> come<00:03:14.730> alive<00:03:15.000> yeah<00:03:15.660> which<00:03:15.870> would

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
everything come alive yeah which would

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.540 
form factor that's that's very bad it
just<00:04:41.259> makes<00:04:41.380> it<00:04:41.590> work<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.979> have<00:04:42.250> something

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
just makes it work I have something

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.770 
just makes it work I have something
that's<00:04:42.669> mobile<00:04:42.970> now<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.389> still<00:04:43.599> powerful

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
that's mobile now and still powerful

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.659 
that's mobile now and still powerful
still<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.139> dedicated<00:04:44.530> graphics<00:04:44.919> card<00:04:45.130> okay

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
still a dedicated graphics card okay

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.059 
still a dedicated graphics card okay
still<00:04:46.539> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.080> similar<00:04:47.500> technology

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
still going to have similar technology

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.409 
still going to have similar technology
to<00:04:48.099> this<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.910> fact<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.120> it's<00:04:49.330> a

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
to this in the fact that it's a

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.480 
to this in the fact that it's a
combination<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:50.110> a<00:04:50.199> regular<00:04:50.650> hard<00:04:50.860> drive<00:04:51.039> plus

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
combination of a regular hard drive plus

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.150 
combination of a regular hard drive plus
a<00:04:51.520> solid<00:04:51.970> state<00:04:52.180> hard<00:04:52.330> drive<00:04:52.599> so<00:04:53.410> solid<00:04:54.009> state

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
a solid state hard drive so solid state

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.610 
a solid state hard drive so solid state
is<00:04:54.310> really<00:04:54.759> fantastic<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.620> traditionally

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
is really fantastic but traditionally

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.589 
is really fantastic but traditionally
you<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.039> have<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> limitation<00:04:57.759> on<00:04:57.849> space<00:04:58.210> right

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
you you have a limitation on space right

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.969 
you you have a limitation on space right
so<00:04:58.780> what<00:04:58.930> we<00:04:59.020> were<00:04:59.110> able<00:04:59.199> to<00:04:59.319> do<00:04:59.500> is<00:04:59.740> put<00:04:59.949> a

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
so what we were able to do is put a

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.499 
so what we were able to do is put a
little<00:05:00.159> solid-state<00:05:00.610> memory<00:05:00.759> in<00:05:01.060> there<00:05:01.270> it

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
little solid-state memory in there it

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.059 
little solid-state memory in there it
helps<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.870> boot<00:05:02.080> up<00:05:02.229> times<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.800> helps

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
helps with the boot up times it helps

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.339 
helps with the boot up times it helps
with<00:05:03.370> some<00:05:03.669> of<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.270> applications<00:05:04.419> loading

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
with some of the applications loading

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.379 
with some of the applications loading
and<00:05:05.530> then<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:05.949> a<00:05:05.979> full<00:05:06.310> size<00:05:06.550> big<00:05:07.240> boy

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
and then you have a full size big boy

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.969 
and then you have a full size big boy
hard<00:05:07.659> drive<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.050> there<00:05:08.199> as<00:05:08.349> well<00:05:08.380> giving<00:05:08.889> you

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
hard drive in there as well giving you

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.860 
hard drive in there as well giving you
plenty<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.550> space<00:05:09.909> to<00:05:09.940> work<00:05:10.210> with<00:05:10.270> best<00:05:10.750> of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
plenty of space to work with best of

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.120 
plenty of space to work with best of
both<00:05:10.990> worlds<00:05:11.319> awesome<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.949> what<00:05:12.039> I'm

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
both worlds awesome and what I'm

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.740 
both worlds awesome and what I'm
thinking<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.550> for<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.789> SSD<00:05:13.150> Drive<00:05:13.360> i<00:05:13.479> would<00:05:13.630> i

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
thinking is for the SSD Drive i would i

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.510 
thinking is for the SSD Drive i would i
would<00:05:13.810> probably<00:05:14.349> put<00:05:14.380> some<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.800> my<00:05:14.830> more

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
would probably put some of my more

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.790 
would probably put some of my more
active<00:05:16.360> programming<00:05:17.139> and<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.409> things<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.710> i

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
active programming and the things that i

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.409 
active programming and the things that i
would<00:05:18.009> do<00:05:18.159> on<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.340> regular<00:05:18.520> disk<00:05:19.030> drive<00:05:19.270> is

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
would do on a regular disk drive is

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.420 
would do on a regular disk drive is
where<00:05:19.930> i<00:05:19.960> would<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.530> store<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.830> well<00:05:21.280> it's

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
where i would just store it well it's

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.129 
where i would just store it well it's
actually<00:05:21.789> better<00:05:21.940> than<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.270> because<00:05:22.539> the

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
actually better than that because the

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.499 
actually better than that because the
solid<00:05:23.800> state<00:05:23.949> drive<00:05:24.190> does<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:24.759> for<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.150> you

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
solid state drive does that for you you

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.120 
solid state drive does that for you you
don't<00:05:25.690> have<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.020> do<00:05:26.139> it<00:05:26.259> automatically<00:05:26.830> it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
don't have to do it automatically it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.550 
don't have to do it automatically it
actually<00:05:27.550> learns<00:05:28.060> what<00:05:28.360> programs<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:29.080> use<00:05:29.110> on

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
actually learns what programs you use on

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.560 
actually learns what programs you use on
a<00:05:29.590> regular<00:05:29.650> basis<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.550> then<00:05:31.000> puts<00:05:31.240> those<00:05:31.389> on

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
a regular basis and then puts those on

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.689 
a regular basis and then puts those on
the<00:05:31.659> solid<00:05:31.960> state<00:05:32.169> drive<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.830> as<00:05:33.009> you<00:05:33.280> use<00:05:33.520> your

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
the solid state drive so as you use your

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.149 
the solid state drive so as you use your
computer<00:05:33.849> it<00:05:34.210> actually<00:05:34.419> gets<00:05:34.810> faster<00:05:35.590> very

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
computer it actually gets faster very

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.909 
computer it actually gets faster very
nice<00:05:36.430> well<00:05:36.820> that<00:05:37.419> is<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.599> series<00:05:38.020> 7<00:05:38.409> family

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
nice well that is the series 7 family

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.249 
nice well that is the series 7 family
