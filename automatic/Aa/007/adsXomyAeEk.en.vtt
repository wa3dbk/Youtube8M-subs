 present to your attention the model 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 electrovenik 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.679
 rg rapids two in one that is possible 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.950
 vacuuming them in that condition 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.320
 assembled, you can remove one part and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.670
 collect there crumbs sand or in the corners 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 in general, first demonstrate how he 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.590
 assembled will work below 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.590
 backlight will include 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.090
 you can see that the bottom 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.699
 rotates 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.670
 highlighting beautiful gives opportunity 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.450
 especially in dark corners find 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:17.009
 terrible debris or dust 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:24.320
 can turn on turn on 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.320
 button on the handle and now disconnect 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.789
 part also press 2 buttons 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.909
 simultaneously pulled out freely and 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:40.939
 this vacuum cleaner a little well, for example on 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.939
 drawing we will remove 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.990
 the lower part is disconnected separately so 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.890
 drag see what collected for 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.890
 these two minutes 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.400
 We take out on turn this 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.020
 the inside is collected considering that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.050
 vacuum them the last three days every day 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.080
 same several times a day inside 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 dust and sand of a cat gather too 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.000
 filler are you even collecting for this 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.850
 and was taken for small garbage but i think 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.450
 what with daily use of minutes 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.280
 20 missing battery 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 charging he has not yet spotted 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.590
 how much time generally needed stood 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 all night for cleaning the whole apartment such 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.040
 superficially probably bitter 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 enough apartment us on our own 80 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.010
 squares 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.450
 we have enough to run through the corners and 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.010
 so of course a big vacuum cleaner for 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.040
 general cleaning most likely too 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.700
 will need light enough 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.520
 In general, quite what they wanted 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.739
 and for the money we think it is very very 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.739
 all the benefits of all the tips
