00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.689
 Century the name 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.029
 Winter games 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.369
 Wagoner was I hope that stays that way 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.619
 first you have to go back 2003 years 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.589
 Consciously paid off here last year 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.809
 and that way 2006 Claudia will have made clear the Icelandic 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.180
 Coach still out on this tour we have the real goal before three 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.450
 Years Lake Baikal 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.420
 he did not reach the wind made a dash through the bill minus 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.420
 12 degrees 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.770
 in Siberia 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.590
 In the beginning of September was not exactly pleasant at that time he took it in Krasnaya 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 put the motorcycles in the Trans-Siberian Railway and even a ticket 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.090
 Bought 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.600
 eastbound 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 So this trip was not over and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.850
 2009 are once again broken the real goal of 2006 the biker 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 to reach them and Mongolia 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 ca 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.970
 2009 had here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.980
 a bit of bad luck 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.170
 after all, the f6 50 already has 100 roses on the clock 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.320
 they have been stressing on the last trip already in Germany again 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.170
 the engine fails like broken wheel bearing broken 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.409
 and in Kyrgyzstan to the control unit 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.609
 There is a lot at halftime that we lost to spare parts 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:33.770
 to advise 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.910
 but on the whole because the trip was just as we had imagined 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.310
 the biker see 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.149
 As you can see, especially Mongolia is unlikely 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.660
 impressive the further a land without fences 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.380
 the largest camping place in the world built a tent in the market and percent 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.050
 Finally, we were again in the pamir mountains again some people 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 visited in 2006 we have ever met 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.419
 i deal with the people i am in i photographed them and 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.389
 Picked up some pictures that already takes its time percents and me 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.929
 would like to give the feeling against the dust 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.239
 Percent not easy to be photographed on many occasions 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.799
 you get positive response if you are interested in these people 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.899
 what they are doing what they are doing 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.399
 and I always have a polaroid camera here or a small mini 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.879
 Printer to use what of me 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.599
 and that these are sometimes very moving moments 2006 is more a granny crying 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 fallen around the neck because here is a photo 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 SID with her together with her granddaughter 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.669
 on 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.669
 because 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 n 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 if few rooms 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.239
 you just have to see the pictures of the last trip but you want to 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.530
 Immediately start again in two three years Magadan Lot of Bones 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.479
 time to drive 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.479
 what's right they just give class a detour 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.409
 to Mongolia because it is also a beautiful country 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.849
 also 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.789
 sometimes challenging for slopes 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.649
 and Proust I like to see it again for me that's what percent 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.519
 more haunting in the head 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.819
 I always try a little bit of the satisfaction you are on the way 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.809
 he goes to the only case no one still bothers to conserve and for 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.109
 the everyday life at home also a bit of the deduction 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:49.179
 a good time and the memory to conserve more relaxed can be the end 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.669
 hardly be a journey 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.309
 the whole parish 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.559
 the many discoveries to book all this 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.559
 Now it is over 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.969
 I'm not sad about that at the moment for the family 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.969
 the familiar environment mother's guidance 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.739
 my wanderlust has been used up 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.949
 a condition 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.249
 which will certainly not last long 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:16.099
 there is still this place because sometimes it can not be so dangerous 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.639
 Monschau
