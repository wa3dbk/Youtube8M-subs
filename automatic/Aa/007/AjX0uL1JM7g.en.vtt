the<00:01:22.680> width<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> bake<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.150> whole<00:01:24.390> idea<00:01:25.369> was

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the width of the bake the whole idea was

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
the width of the bake the whole idea was
to<00:01:26.430> take<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> snapper<00:01:27.390> wrap

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
to take this snapper wrap

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
give it more lift and give it more glide

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.569 
give it more lift and give it more glide
that<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> design<00:01:33.630> concept<00:01:34.590> behind<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that was the design concept behind it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.600 
that was the design concept behind it
now<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> Europeans<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.619> design<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> bait

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
now the Europeans they design this bait

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.050 
now the Europeans they design this bait
for<00:01:39.150> open<00:01:39.540> water<00:01:39.780> fishing<00:01:40.430> they're<00:01:41.430> available

catches<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.660> many<00:02:24.870> very<00:02:25.320> species<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.310> fish<00:02:26.550> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
catches so many very species of fish you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.230 
catches so many very species of fish you
know<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.060> caught<00:02:27.330> wildlife<00:02:27.870> big<00:02:28.200> Pike<00:02:29.240> pan

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
know we caught wildlife big Pike pan

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
experimenting down in salt water and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.970 
experimenting down in salt water and
he's<00:02:35.340> catching<00:02:35.790> tarpon<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.740> redfish<00:02:37.740> in

he's catching tarpon and redfish in

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.360 
he's catching tarpon and redfish in

holes in River situation one of the real

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.310 
holes in River situation one of the real
keys<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:42.000> successful<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.230> know

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
keys to be successful is it you know

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020 
keys to be successful is it you know
experimenting<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.190> different<00:02:44.370> baits<00:02:44.820> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
experimenting with different baits and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.990 
experimenting with different baits and
it<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.240> tell<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.930> thing<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:47.220> snap<00:02:47.640> wrap

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it can tell you one thing this snap wrap

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
it can tell you one thing this snap wrap
technique<00:02:48.330> deepwater<00:02:49.140> fishing<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:50.160> really

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
technique deepwater fishing it's really

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.930 
technique deepwater fishing it's really
an<00:02:50.850> amazingly<00:02:51.450> simple<00:02:52.080> technique<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:53.640> just

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
an amazingly simple technique it's just

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.090 
an amazingly simple technique it's just
unbelievably<00:02:54.600> effective<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.770> so

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
unbelievably effective it really is so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.770 
unbelievably effective it really is so
what<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.520> do<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:56.970> simply<00:02:57.360> flip

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
what I'm going to do is just simply flip

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.510 
what I'm going to do is just simply flip
the<00:02:57.900> bait<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.110> away<00:02:58.530> from<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.770> boat<00:02:58.980> let<00:02:59.400> it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
the bait out away from the boat let it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.610 
the bait out away from the boat let it
sink<00:02:59.730> down<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> bottom<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:01.260> start

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
sink down to the bottom and just start

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.560 
sink down to the bottom and just start
moving<00:03:01.950> along<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.270> little

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
moving along but you have a little

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.940 
moving along but you have a little
distance<00:03:03.750> you're<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.560> fishing

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
distance you're not actually fishing

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
distance you're not actually fishing
debate<00:03:05.340> vertically<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.270> actually

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
debate vertically you're actually

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.350 
debate vertically you're actually
dragging<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.350> bait<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.800> an<00:03:08.370> angle<00:03:08.790> away<00:03:08.940> from

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
dragging the bait on an angle away from

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.110 
dragging the bait on an angle away from
the<00:03:09.450> boat<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.350> at<00:03:10.590> about<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.520> 62

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the boat in it's a at about like a 62

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
the boat in it's a at about like a 62
degree<00:03:12.750> angle<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.560> I'm<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:13.950> ripping<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
degree angle and I'm just ripping the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.220 
degree angle and I'm just ripping the
bait<00:03:14.700> off<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> bottom<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> biggest

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
bait off the bottom one of the biggest

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.650 
bait off the bottom one of the biggest
things<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.459> following<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.239> bait<00:03:18.420> as

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
things is I'm not following the bait as

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.360 
things is I'm not following the bait as
it<00:03:18.870> falls<00:03:19.140> back<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> bottom<00:03:20.100> you're

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it falls back to the bottom you're

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.990 
it falls back to the bottom you're
actually<00:03:20.790> letting<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.510> fall<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.989> slack<00:03:22.410> line

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
actually letting it fall on a slack line

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.370 
actually letting it fall on a slack line
seems<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.630> little<00:03:24.930> bit<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
seems like that is a little bit of a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
seems like that is a little bit of a
better<00:03:25.590> triggering<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.430> don't<00:03:26.610> want<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.880> slow

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
better triggering you don't want to slow

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.770 
better triggering you don't want to slow
the<00:03:27.420> plug<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.049> drop<00:03:28.320> speed<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> bait<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the plug the drop speed of the bait it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.350 
the plug the drop speed of the bait it
is<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> reaction<00:03:31.320> fight<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.070> yeah<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.090> know<00:03:33.239> a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
is a reaction fight and yeah you know a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.259 
is a reaction fight and yeah you know a
lot<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.810> times<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.140> hear<00:03:34.290> people<00:03:34.320> talk<00:03:34.860> about

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
lot of times you hear people talk about

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.610 
lot of times you hear people talk about
fishing<00:03:36.269> for<00:03:36.510> bass<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.110> bass<00:03:37.350> with<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
fishing for bass and bass with a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.380 
fishing for bass and bass with a
reaction<00:03:37.980> bait<00:03:38.459> something<00:03:38.940> that's<00:03:39.090> moving

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
reaction bait something that's moving

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.190 
reaction bait something that's moving
real<00:03:39.660> fast

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
real fast

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.479 
real fast
getting<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.830> know<00:03:40.950> through<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> water

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
getting you know through the water

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.580 
getting you know through the water
column<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.090> going<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.930> horizontal

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
column and going in a horizontal

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.710 
column and going in a horizontal
movement<00:03:44.040> well<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> reaction<00:03:45.269> bike

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
movement well this is a reaction bike

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960 
movement well this is a reaction bike
but<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.530> vertical<00:03:46.890> movement<00:03:47.310> that

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
but it's in a vertical movement that

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.720 
but it's in a vertical movement that
bait<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> heavy<00:03:48.930> bait<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:50.010> jumps<00:03:50.580> off

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
bait is a heavy bait and it jumps off

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
bait is a heavy bait and it jumps off
the<00:03:50.910> bottom<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.570> flops<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:52.080> back<00:03:52.290> down

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the bottom and it flops right back down

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.320 
the bottom and it flops right back down
in<00:03:52.739> their<00:03:52.890> face<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.850> Internet<00:03:54.150> if

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
in their face and the Internet if

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.050 
in their face and the Internet if
they're<00:03:54.690> reacting<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.709> bait<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.160> just

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
they're reacting to that bait just just

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.339 
they're reacting to that bait just just
they<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.239> go<00:03:57.570> full<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.080> hit

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
they just go full and hit

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.339 
they just go full and hit
so<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.280> key<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.879> presentation<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.989> a

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
so the key to the presentation is a

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.459 
so the key to the presentation is a
rhythm<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:04.219> get<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.760> rhythm<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.749> the<00:04:05.959> depth<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
rhythm you get a rhythm to the depth to

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.569 
rhythm you get a rhythm to the depth to
the<00:04:06.680> speed<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.370> wind<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:10.099> just<00:04:10.340> catch

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
the speed to the wind and you just catch

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.920 
the speed to the wind and you just catch
a<00:04:10.819> load<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.569> fish<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.439> below<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.829> fish<00:04:13.930> there
