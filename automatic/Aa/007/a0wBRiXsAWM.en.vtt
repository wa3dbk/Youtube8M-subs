00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 eye yes she was not as attractive with 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.220
 the time was changing and from 2001 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 became the most beautiful of the family 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 But the story does not stop there today. 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.289
 is another version of the pallium won another 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.869
 platform grew by the name of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.060
 and continues to attract many 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 looks without speaking from 14 centimeters to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 distance between the axles 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 place in the class of compact sedans with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.210
 the average size 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.370
 the chevrolet cobalt and santa ersa and see it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.399
 well the space for those going back here 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 Rose but I gave everything is perfect yet 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.620
 a little progress should be made 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.570
 Legs go limp 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.739
 but in width the Japanese car takes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.469
 advantage 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.079
 the change came in the trunk 20 liters 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.449
 more compared to the old cinema and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 compensates for the space of the cover arms 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.520
 occupy when closed 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.899
 the finish deserves consideration 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.750
 quality materials with bolts 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 and a differentiated design give a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 air of modernity to the interior of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.250
 kinship with the new pallium only panel 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.610
 steering wheel and the lack of a three 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.619
 points in the middle of the rear seat 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.890
 not to fight with the cousin linea hogan 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.369
 siena only available with 1.4 ego engine 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.220
 the attractive version or 1.6 and torque in the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.140
 six like this one even testing 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 weighing 18 kilos more than the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.259
 predecessor 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 performance is good in accelerations of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 speed you have to be aware when 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 the engine is less than two thousand 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 rotations per minute 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.390
 at this moment the torque is low 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.329
 The result should be to accelerate 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 more than normal to boot 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.600
 especially in climbs 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 the situation is repeated in the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 engine speed is 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.380
 you need to quickly reduce 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 if you have a more positive answer 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 at least this work is facilitated 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.960
 by the soft and precise 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.969
 manual gearbox five-speed consumption 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.879
 in our testing circuit that half 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.630
 city â€‹â€‹half road we get average 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.910
 of 6.5 kilometers per liter of ethanol 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.560
 comma or gasoline brands 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.400
 taking into account the category 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.850
 the car a cool surprise is the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260
 stability 1 trillion - in curves 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.210
 than the previous model 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460
 grand siena gives more security to the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.500
 address the merits of the new suspension 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.680
 and the greater distance between 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.840
 axes that left more balance 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.550
 It is best not to forget the port and the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.710
 silence or other correct position 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.960
 steering wheel with good footprint and steering 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.940
 hydraulics in the right measure has made 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.220
 nice to run the grand 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.210
 that already comes with front airbags 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.350
 and serial abs 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.140
 although it is not the cheapest 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.180
 segment is also not the most expensive as well 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.430
 equipped also has the advantage of 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.430
 reliability created by the predecessors
