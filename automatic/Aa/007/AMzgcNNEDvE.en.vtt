there<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.689> come<00:01:31.869> over<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.259> the

there I'm going to come over to the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.929 
there I'm going to come over to the
opposite<00:01:32.710> edge<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.070> anvil<00:01:33.399> I'm<00:01:33.610> going<00:01:33.850> to

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
opposite edge of the anvil I'm going to

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.639 
opposite edge of the anvil I'm going to
lay<00:01:34.090> off<00:01:34.270> about<00:01:34.420> three<00:01:34.750> quarters<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.229> into<00:01:35.470> the

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
lay off about three quarters of into the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.260 
lay off about three quarters of into the
outside<00:01:36.009> edge<00:01:36.250> at<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.820> top<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:38.079> I'm<00:01:38.259> going<00:01:38.500> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
outside edge at the top and I'm going to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
outside edge at the top and I'm going to
drive<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.570> now<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.479> was<00:01:43.600> my<00:01:43.750> first<00:01:43.990> move

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
drive that now that was my first move

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.730 
drive that now that was my first move
left<00:01:45.610> some<00:01:45.850> maps<00:01:46.090> here<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:47.289> I've<00:01:47.409> since

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
left some maps here that I've since

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.660 
left some maps here that I've since
driven<00:01:48.280> back<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.119> foot<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> back<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.319> bar

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
driven back and foot on the back the bar

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.580 
driven back and foot on the back the bar
so<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.700> would<00:01:51.970> be<00:01:52.000> job<00:01:52.689> technical<00:01:53.649> term<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
so that would be job technical term so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.679 
so that would be job technical term so
I've<00:01:56.979> done<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:57.549> is<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.090> no<00:01:58.299> matter<00:01:58.330> what

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
you do come back to where your first

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.089 
you do come back to where your first

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
staff to the top away from your hammer

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.669 
staff to the top away from your hammer
and<00:02:03.429> move<00:02:04.119> out<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.569> off<00:02:04.810> side<00:02:04.840> edge<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
and move out to the off side edge of the

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.969 
and move out to the off side edge of the
anvil<00:02:06.130> slide<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.090> about<00:02:07.360> 45<00:02:08.110> degrees<00:02:08.289> from<00:02:08.920> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
anvil slide it about 45 degrees from the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.960 
anvil slide it about 45 degrees from the
hammer<00:02:09.310> pull<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.000> back<00:02:10.179> about<00:02:10.479> an<00:02:10.660> eight<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
hammer pull it back about an eight and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:30.660 
hammer pull it back about an eight and
rain<00:02:12.970> upon<00:02:13.299> it<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.350> make<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.739> slope<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.250> want

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
rain upon it so I make the slope I want

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.630 
rain upon it so I make the slope I want
it<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:32.019> dropping<00:02:32.620> my<00:02:32.650> Tom<00:02:33.100> hangers-on

so<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.079> he'll<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:51.010> step<00:02:51.400> gets<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.850> little

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so that he'll that step gets a little

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.030 
so that he'll that step gets a little
bit<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.799> heat

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
