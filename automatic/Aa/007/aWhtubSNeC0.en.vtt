00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.530 

guess<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.519> use<00:02:14.700> some<00:02:14.940> drain<00:02:15.209> hose<00:02:15.450> oh<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
guess I can use some drain hose oh you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.360 
guess I can use some drain hose oh you
want<00:02:18.750> me<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.989> take<00:02:19.200> off<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> chute<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.220> what

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
want me to take off the chute see what

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.860 
want me to take off the chute see what
it<00:02:20.430> looks<00:02:20.549> like<00:02:20.640> after<00:02:21.269> running<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> water

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it looks like after running in the water

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.360 
it looks like after running in the water
okay<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:26.000> here's<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.060> shoe<00:02:28.160> here's<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
okay so here's the shoe here's the

okay so here's the shoe here's the
inside<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.610> water<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:36.209> fair<00:02:36.480> enough<00:02:36.510> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
inside the water so it's fair enough to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.289 
inside the water so it's fair enough to
say<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.459> still<00:02:38.610> run<00:02:38.910> through<00:02:39.120> mud

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
say that you can still run through mud

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.130 
say that you can still run through mud
and<00:02:39.330> water<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.820> not<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.360> know<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:43.110> that

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
low I'm usually used to something maybe

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.760 
low I'm usually used to something maybe
four<00:04:14.310> five<00:04:15.060> or<00:04:15.300> six<00:04:15.480> millimeter<00:04:15.930> these<00:04:16.470> are

four five or six millimeter these are
about<00:04:17.010> maybe<00:04:17.310> three<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:19.440> only<00:04:19.590> thing<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.340> think

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
about maybe three the only thing I think

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.440 
about maybe three the only thing I think
I<00:04:22.160> would<00:04:23.160> probably<00:04:23.340> change<00:04:23.730> instrument<00:04:24.300> maybe

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
I wouldn't change it but the rubber is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.610 
I wouldn't change it but the rubber is
so<00:04:26.520> soft<00:04:26.880> underneath<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.290> do<00:04:28.470> actually

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
