a crown brush from crown brushes it's

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.999 
a crown brush from crown brushes it's
pretty<00:01:31.030> affordable<00:01:31.930> I'll<00:01:32.440> try<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.710> find<00:01:32.920> the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
pretty affordable I'll try to find the

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.430 
pretty affordable I'll try to find the
link<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.460> add<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.659> bottom<00:01:34.960> bar<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
link and add this to the bottom bar the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.010 
link and add this to the bottom bar the
reason<00:01:35.830> why<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:35.979> use<00:01:36.429> this<00:01:36.789> rather<00:01:37.300> than<00:01:37.720> my

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
reason why I use this rather than my

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.760 
reason why I use this rather than my
stippling<00:01:38.619> brush<00:01:38.770> because<00:01:39.550> when<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.729> um<00:01:40.149> if<00:01:41.080> I'm

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
stippling brush because when I um if I'm

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.450 
stippling brush because when I um if I'm
to<00:01:42.190> blend<00:01:43.179> this<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:44.440> little<00:01:44.679> tricky<00:01:45.220> and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
to blend this it's a little tricky and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.150 
to blend this it's a little tricky and
it's<00:01:45.789> not<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.630> doesn't<00:01:47.350> look<00:01:47.380> smooth<00:01:47.830> so

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
it's not it just doesn't look smooth so

00:01:48.160 --> 00:02:04.230 
it's not it just doesn't look smooth so
I'd<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.399> something<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:48.880> well<00:01:49.750> packed

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.899 

here's<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.140> outcome<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.950> nice<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.520> smooth

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
here's the outcome it's nice and smooth

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.540 
here's the outcome it's nice and smooth
and<00:02:07.240> actually<00:02:08.200> write<00:02:08.470> when<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.740> buff<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.190> into

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
and actually write when you buff it into

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550 
and actually write when you buff it into
your<00:02:09.700> face<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.330> liquid<00:02:10.720> kind<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.080> turns<00:02:11.380> into

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
your face the liquid kind of turns into

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.260 
your face the liquid kind of turns into
a<00:02:11.680> different<00:02:11.830> consistency<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.910> almost<00:02:13.090> like

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
a different consistency it's almost like

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.320 
a different consistency it's almost like
a<00:02:13.300> silky<00:02:13.810> powder<00:02:14.280> soft<00:02:15.280> finish<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.030> mean<00:02:16.180> it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
a silky powder soft finish I mean it's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.050 
a silky powder soft finish I mean it's
