00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.199

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm Mike Hanley with cars dot com if you're looking for a pickup truck that can

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.770
perform both

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.869
working people hauling duties a
full-size

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.230
crew cab truck is a long way to go

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.880
I'm here with the GMC Sierra kar
cabinets one such model

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.950
let's take a look at some other things
that has to offer the Sierras actually

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.450
related to the Chevy Silverado but it
hasn't its own unique front appearance

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.720
you can see it as this distinctive
chrome girl pretty vertical designed to

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.360
the girl

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.199
and also little bald in the summer heard
that gives us some distinctiveness

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.940
now be a crew cab model has for full
size doors

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.830
which extend the length of the truck
overall but it has a short

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.220
cargo box in the and so the truck while
large is an excessively big overall

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.610
the Sears a bill with the number
different engines and this one here is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.920
the 5.3 liter

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.979
all aluminum v-8 makes 315 horsepower

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.180
their third a popular park and it feels
pretty strong in this application

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.200
this engine works with a four-speed
automatic transmission

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
that may seem like a transmission with
not letting here's a but it works well

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.150
and that's what matters on the road as
mention this is a light-duty

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.860
Sierra it comes with a short cargo box
payload for this truck is about sixteen

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.960
hundred pounds

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.439
and you can see here though that has a
plastic bed liner

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.170
on more and more trucks were starting to
see molded

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.299
cargo bed liners which are more durable
than plastic but GMC is still using the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.270
plastic setup

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.429
the Sears available with the new
all-terrain packet for 2008 like this

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.149
model here

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.000
it's based on the z71 off-road group and
includes

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.229
this my permit like a heavy-duty
trailering package special 18-inch alloy

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.109
wheels

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.450
badges and Rancho shock absorber

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.109
the sierra has won a nicer and shares on
the truck world but the competition's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.619
making strides with recent redesign for
the Dodge Ram and Ford F 150

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.759
you can see here it has an almost car
like bash court appearance

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.899
and when you choose the all terrain
model you get this

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.960
brushed aluminum like surface on the
dash and when you choose FLT trim level

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.840
and get the authoring group to get these
two tone leather seats with the crew cab

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.290
truck

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.040
you expect space in the back seat for
passengers to ride comfortably

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.849
and that's mostly the case with the
sierra leg room is good headroom is good

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.080
the one real downfall is that the
backrest

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.280
above this rear bench seat just barely
afraid and that could become one country

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.640
while a longer drive

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.819
when the other advantages our crew cab
is that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.180
you can have lotsa room for secure
storage have luggage

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.220
you don't throw it in the car a bad and
with the sierra

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.280
it has a really handy way that flip of
the rear seats to give you that storage

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.189
area he just left up on the question

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.790
push it up and I stays in place free
sample

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.689
same way going down so if you have
something like a suitcase

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.239
is put it down on a flat for

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.000
the series won our favorite tracks
because its refined driving experience

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.970
and overall utility but things can get
pretty expensive when you check out the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.840
action boxes this truck here

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.280
goes for about forty five thousand
dollars and I don't have to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.569
get all those things but if you want all
the features Picasa quite a bit

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.099
for additional information on this car
or any other

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.930
