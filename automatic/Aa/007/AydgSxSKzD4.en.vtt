from<00:00:47.950> around<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.460> cover<00:00:48.670> watch<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.360> don't<00:00:49.540> go

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
from around the cover watch you don't go

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.810 
from around the cover watch you don't go
in<00:00:49.870> too<00:00:50.110> deep<00:00:50.380> because<00:00:51.040> then<00:00:51.310> you<00:00:51.430> might<00:00:51.610> hit

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
in too deep because then you might hit

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.050 
in too deep because then you might hit
the<00:00:52.200> printed<00:00:53.200> circuit<00:00:53.410> board<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:53.980> here<00:00:54.370> so

what<00:00:55.180> we're<00:00:55.300> going<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.480> do<00:00:55.630> is<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:55.930> already<00:00:56.170> cut

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
what we're going to do is we already cut

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.650 
what we're going to do is we already cut
it<00:00:56.530> we're<00:00:56.650> going<00:00:56.740> to<00:00:56.830> pry<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.100> off<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:58.360> go<00:00:58.510> in

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
it we're going to pry it off don't go in

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.230 
it we're going to pry it off don't go in
too<00:00:58.810> deep<00:00:59.020> just<00:00:59.290> lift<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.590> out<00:00:59.740> and<00:01:00.100> pick<00:01:00.970> it<00:01:01.090> up

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
too deep just lift it out and pick it up

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.630 
too deep just lift it out and pick it up
then<00:01:01.570> we<00:01:01.690> expose<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.320> interior<00:01:02.920> we're<00:01:03.520> going

checked in a coal mode too because if

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.550 
checked in a coal mode too because if

you went to lean the engine might not

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.680 
you went to lean the engine might not
start<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.550> it's<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.729> trial<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.240> error

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690

on<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> lean<00:02:54.500> side<00:02:54.830> right<00:02:55.070> there<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.910> we're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
on a lean side right there so we're

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.460 
on a lean side right there so we're
going<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> try<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.420> put<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.810> position

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
going to try to put it in that position

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.280 
going to try to put it in that position

lean side potentiometer comes down

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.580 
lean side potentiometer comes down
engine<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.830> leaning<00:03:10.190> out

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
engine is leaning out

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.190 
engine is leaning out
you<00:03:12.130> go<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.310> lien<00:03:12.670> like<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.030> said<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.930> engines

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
you go to lien like I said the engines

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.170 
you go to lien like I said the engines
going<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.380> try<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.560> kill<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.130> got<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.000> get<00:03:16.090> in

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
going to try to kill you got to get in

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.330 
going to try to kill you got to get in
an<00:03:16.270> ideal<00:03:16.810> position<00:03:17.050> we're<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.099> try<00:03:18.280> it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
an ideal position we're going to try it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.210 
an ideal position we're going to try it
like<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.380> can<00:03:20.530> move<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.709> finger<00:03:21.069> up

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
like that so we can move the finger up

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.610 
like that so we can move the finger up
that's<00:03:21.489> rich<00:03:21.900> back<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.110> where<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> normal

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that's rich back to where a normal

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.140 
that's rich back to where a normal
position<00:03:23.770> is<00:03:24.160> with<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> spring<00:03:24.640> load<00:03:24.849> on<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
position is with the spring load on it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.690 
position is with the spring load on it
was<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.530> come<00:03:26.530> back<00:03:26.650> down<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.220> lean<00:03:27.430> right

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
was that come back down is to lean right

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.699 
was that come back down is to lean right
there<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.690> could<00:03:28.930> be<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.080> good<00:03:29.290> setting

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
there so that could be a good setting

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.860 
there so that could be a good setting
right<00:03:29.860> there<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.760> drive<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.750> how

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
right there we have to drive it see how

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410 
right there we have to drive it see how
it<00:03:32.019> performs<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.800> performs<00:03:33.310> fine<00:03:33.550> good<00:03:33.910> let

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
it performs the performs fine good let

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300 
it performs the performs fine good let
it<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.660> cold<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.140> start<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.920> car<00:03:36.130> has

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it get cold and start the car has

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.920 
it get cold and start the car has
trouble<00:03:36.640> starting<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.120> got<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.420> go<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.569> back<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
trouble starting it got to go to back to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.199 
trouble starting it got to go to back to
the<00:03:38.019> rich<00:03:38.800> in<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.160> little<00:03:39.310> bit<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.060> hit

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
the rich in it a little bit so you hit

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.089 
the rich in it a little bit so you hit
the<00:03:40.239> ideal<00:03:40.750> position<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.620> all<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.890> going<00:03:42.040> to

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
the ideal position and all you going to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.820 
the ideal position and all you going to
do<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.280> snap<00:03:42.519> this<00:03:42.760> right<00:03:43.030> back<00:03:43.239> into<00:03:43.510> position

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.390 

and<00:03:47.830> then<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.100> have<00:03:48.340> air<00:03:49.000> flow<00:03:49.690> meter<00:03:50.440> lean<00:03:51.190> up

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and then you have air flow meter lean up

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.509 
and then you have air flow meter lean up
not<00:03:52.239> an<00:03:52.420> air<00:03:52.569> mass<00:03:52.840> sensor<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:53.530> lot<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.310> times

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
not an air mass sensor a lot of times

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.979 
not an air mass sensor a lot of times
you<00:03:54.700> use<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.120> map<00:03:55.680> map<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.980> handoff<00:03:57.989> enhancer

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
you use the map map and handoff enhancer

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.960 
you use the map map and handoff enhancer
to<00:03:59.170> set<00:03:59.380> those<00:03:59.590> this<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.549> here<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:00.910> to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
to set those this right here is going to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.140 
to set those this right here is going to
be<00:04:01.090> manually<00:04:01.510> adjusted
