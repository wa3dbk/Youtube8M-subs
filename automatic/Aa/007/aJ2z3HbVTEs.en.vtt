00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
because all the other hardware was bead

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
because all the other hardware was bead
blasted<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.620> these<00:00:37.620> old<00:00:37.800> domes<00:00:38.010> were<00:00:38.160> also

blasted and these old domes were also
bead<00:00:38.640> blasted<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.480> reason<00:00:39.840> they

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bead blasted but for some reason they

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.280 
bead blasted but for some reason they
would<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.680> heed<00:00:40.980> anodized<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> had<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
would not heed anodized so what I had to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
would not heed anodized so what I had to
end<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> sanding<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

end up doing is sanding them down and
polishing<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:47.100> came<00:00:47.309> out

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
