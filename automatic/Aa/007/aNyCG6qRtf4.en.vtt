00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
though you didn't go minding ore mining

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.770 
though you didn't go minding ore mining
so<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.930> find<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.500> always<00:03:32.710> really<00:03:33.100> helpful<00:03:33.780> so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
so I find that always really helpful so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.170 
so I find that always really helpful so
I<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.170> didn't<00:03:35.620> tamper<00:03:36.040> with<00:03:36.280> any<00:03:36.460> supplies<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
I I didn't tamper with any supplies I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.260 
I I didn't tamper with any supplies I
just<00:03:37.390> looked<00:03:37.840> at<00:03:37.960> them<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:39.160> especially<00:03:39.880> the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
just looked at them so especially the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.510 
just looked at them so especially the
sticky<00:03:40.630> pistons<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.380> noticed<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:42.370> could

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
sticky pistons if you noticed you could

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.070 
sticky pistons if you noticed you could
actually<00:03:42.670> get<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:42.970> sticky<00:03:43.360> pistons<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.990> way

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
actually get the sticky pistons that way

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.750 
actually get the sticky pistons that way
that<00:03:44.380> saves<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.830> time<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.250> getting<00:03:45.490> assigned

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
that saves the time of getting assigned

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.880 
that saves the time of getting assigned
balls<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.360> at<00:03:46.480> least<00:03:46.510> just<00:03:46.780> only<00:03:47.380> want<00:03:47.680> two

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
balls if you at least just only want two

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.790 
balls if you at least just only want two
sticky<00:03:48.400> pistons<00:03:49.060> or<00:03:49.510> more<00:03:50.080> depending<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.590> how

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
sticky pistons or more depending on how

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.090 
sticky pistons or more depending on how
many<00:03:51.540> jungle<00:03:52.540> temples<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.930> find<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.950> end

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
dimension location is right in the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.310 
dimension location is right in the
middle<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.970> some<00:03:57.970> cool<00:03:58.270> guy<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.810> joined<00:04:00.210> so

middle and some cool guy just joined so
yeah<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.470> n<00:04:02.560> dimension<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.160> somewhere<00:04:03.490> around

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
yeah the n dimension is somewhere around

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.630 
yeah the n dimension is somewhere around

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
I don't really want to spoil that well

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.750 
I don't really want to spoil that well
yeah<00:04:09.040> it's<00:04:09.250> basically<00:04:09.610> what<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.330> seat<00:04:10.600> has<00:04:10.630> i

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
yeah it's basically what this seat has i

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680 
yeah it's basically what this seat has i
actually<00:04:12.760> prefer<00:04:12.850> has<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.270> really<00:04:13.510> good

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
actually prefer has a really good

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.320 
actually prefer has a really good
survival<00:04:14.170> seed<00:04:14.380> i<00:04:14.650> would<00:04:15.370> play<00:04:15.550> on<00:04:15.760> survival

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
survival seed i would play on survival

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.530 
survival seed i would play on survival
on<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.890> other<00:04:18.010> one<00:04:18.220> was<00:04:18.520> cool<00:04:18.910> also<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.480> i

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
on this the other one was cool also so i

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.030 
on this the other one was cool also so i
guess<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.870> depends<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.530> what<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.859> actually

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
guess it depends on what you actually

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.850 
guess it depends on what you actually
want<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.510> if<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.780> look<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.169> left<00:04:23.200> middle

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
want so if you look on the left middle

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.290 
want so if you look on the left middle
part<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.430> map<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.610> could<00:04:24.820> also<00:04:24.970> find

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
part of the map you could also find

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.870

everyone

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
everyone

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.630 
everyone
there<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.390> on<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:27.070> where<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.190> spawn<00:04:28.460> you

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
could even mind emeralds right there so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.340 
could even mind emeralds right there so
you<00:04:30.800> could<00:04:31.040> my<00:04:31.850> net<00:04:32.090> emeralds<00:04:32.750> naturally
