China<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.760> believe<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
China is and I believe this is the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
China is and I believe this is the
technical<00:00:43.079> term<00:00:43.489> screwing<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> polar

technical term screwing with the polar

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
technical term screwing with the polar
jet<00:00:45.390> stream<00:00:45.920> basically<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.070> means<00:00:47.280> storms

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
jet stream basically that means storms

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
jet stream basically that means storms
are<00:00:48.180> getting<00:00:48.600> worse<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> winter<00:00:50.280> storm

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
are getting worse so that winter storm

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.569 
are getting worse so that winter storm
Juno<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.539> wreak<00:00:51.899> havoc<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> US<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Juno that just wreak havoc in the US we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850

may<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.090> China<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.660> part<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> thank<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
may have China in part to thank for that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
may have China in part to thank for that
now<00:00:56.520> some<00:00:56.940> believe<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> by<00:00:57.420> releasing<00:00:57.690> more

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
now some believe that by releasing more

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.560 
now some believe that by releasing more
aerosols<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.340> atmosphere<00:00:59.520> we<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
aerosols into the atmosphere we can

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.139 
aerosols into the atmosphere we can
better<00:01:00.899> block<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> Sun<00:01:02.280> dropping

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
better block out the Sun dropping

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
better block out the Sun dropping
