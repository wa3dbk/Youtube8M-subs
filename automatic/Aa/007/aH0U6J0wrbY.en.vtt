when you start to game up this song is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
the background music that actually plays

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.480 
the background music that actually plays
and<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:20.110> version<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.680> same<00:01:20.979> background

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
and this version is the same background

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.940 
and this version is the same background
music<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.850> place<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.240> legal<00:01:22.690> version<00:01:22.869> but<00:01:23.830> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
music to place a legal version but the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.590 
music to place a legal version but the
Kalika<00:01:24.280> version<00:01:24.700> hits<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.210> Smurfs<00:01:25.570> theme

song

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
song

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.300 
song
which<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.140> curious<00:01:28.650> omission

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
which is I think a very curious omission

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.310 
which is I think a very curious omission
because<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> colecovision<00:01:30.840> system<00:01:31.170> was

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
because the colecovision system was

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
because the colecovision system was
actually<00:01:31.620> more<00:01:31.770> powerful<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:33.000> could

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
actually more powerful it could

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
actually more powerful it could
definitely<00:01:33.330> handle<00:01:33.660> something<00:01:34.080> like<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
definitely handle something like this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.450 
definitely handle something like this
her<00:01:35.040> theme<00:01:35.310> song<00:01:35.580> music<00:01:37.190> now<00:01:38.190> you'll<00:01:38.370> notice

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
her theme song music now you'll notice

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.210 
her theme song music now you'll notice
also<00:01:38.910> on<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.330> final<00:01:39.630> stage<00:01:40.080> when<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.770> rescue

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
also on this final stage when you rescue

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
also on this final stage when you rescue
Smurfette<00:01:42.230> instead<00:01:43.230> of<00:01:43.350> jumping<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.830> top<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Smurfette instead of jumping on top of a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.120 
Smurfette instead of jumping on top of a
skull<00:01:44.750> which<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.900> then<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.230> turn<00:01:46.260> jump<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:46.950> top

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
skull which you then in turn jump on top

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
skull which you then in turn jump on top
of<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.400> table<00:01:47.550> from<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.940> skull<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:49.140> jump<00:01:49.980> on

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of the table from the skull you jump on

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.120 
of the table from the skull you jump on
a<00:01:50.130> couple<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> stools<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.440> back<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.860> chair

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
a couple of stools and the back of chair

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.580 
a couple of stools and the back of chair
before<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> spur<00:01:53.910> fat<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:55.350> think

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
before you get to spur fat and I think

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
before you get to spur fat and I think
that's<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:56.010> because<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.730> the<00:01:56.820> graphical

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that's probably because of the graphical

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.500 
that's probably because of the graphical
limitations<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.170> Atari<00:01:59.120> in<00:02:00.120> this<00:02:00.300> version

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
limitations of the Atari in this version

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.090 
limitations of the Atari in this version
there's<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.900> nice<00:02:01.050> heart<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.500> appears<00:02:01.830> when

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
there's a nice heart that appears when

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
there's a nice heart that appears when
you<00:02:02.820> rescue<00:02:03.120> Smurfette<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.690> don't<00:02:03.900> believe

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you rescue Smurfette I don't believe

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.570 
you rescue Smurfette I don't believe
that<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.500> appears<00:02:04.830> in<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> collegial

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
that part appears in the collegial

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.300 
that part appears in the collegial
version<00:02:05.910> but<00:02:06.870> yeah<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.310> beautifully

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
version but yeah the beautifully

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.180 
version but yeah the beautifully
rendered<00:02:08.520> skull<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.270> absent<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.800> probably

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
rendered skull is absent and probably

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.340 
rendered skull is absent and probably
because<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.790> didn't<00:02:12.690> look<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
because it just didn't look much like a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.160 
because it just didn't look much like a
skull<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.710> actually<00:02:14.220> try<00:02:14.310> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.300 
these parts of the stage our new for the
Atari<00:02:45.819> version<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.319> floating<00:02:47.769> cloud<00:02:48.129> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
Atari version and the floating cloud the

Atari version and the floating cloud the
background<00:02:48.639> of<00:02:48.669> that<00:02:48.790> last<00:02:48.970> stage<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.599> also

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
background of that last stage is also

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.550 
background of that last stage is also
not<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.769> colecovision<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:53.319> right<00:02:53.530> now

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
not in the colecovision so right now

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.399 
not in the colecovision so right now
there<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.669> lot<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.030> things<00:02:55.389> that<00:02:55.629> are<00:02:55.750> in

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
there are a lot of things that are in

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.110 
there are a lot of things that are in
the<00:02:56.560> Atari<00:02:56.859> versions<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.430> not<00:02:57.579> new<00:02:57.700> Kaliko

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the Atari versions are not new Kaliko

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.259 
the Atari versions are not new Kaliko
and<00:02:58.329> that's<00:02:58.480> surprising<00:02:59.169> green<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.819> overall

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
and that's surprising green the overall

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.449 
and that's surprising green the overall
graphics<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:02.439> Atari<00:03:02.889> version<00:03:03.280> are

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
graphics of the Atari version are

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.770 
graphics of the Atari version are
obviously<00:03:03.969> worse<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:06.000> they<00:03:07.000> did<00:03:07.269> work<00:03:07.510> well

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
obviously worse but they did work well

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.879 
obviously worse but they did work well
with<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.639> Atari<00:03:09.639> limitations<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.689> was<00:03:11.379> very

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
with the Atari limitations I was very

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.569 
with the Atari limitations I was very
impressed<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:14.379> sound<00:03:14.739> effects<00:03:15.010> bother<00:03:15.310> me<00:03:15.549> a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
impressed the sound effects bother me a

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.429 
impressed the sound effects bother me a
bit<00:03:15.609> though<00:03:15.939> with<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.150> steak<00:03:16.629> sound<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.349> a

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
bit though with that steak sound like a

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.500 
bit though with that steak sound like a
train

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.610 

now<00:03:24.510> let's<00:03:24.689> talk<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:24.870> gameplay<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:26.790> Smurf

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
now let's talk about gameplay in Smurf

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.009 
now let's talk about gameplay in Smurf
like<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> colecovision<00:03:29.340> version<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.450> button

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
like the colecovision version the button

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.679 
like the colecovision version the button
does<00:03:31.200> nothing<00:03:31.849> but<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.239> use<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> joystick

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
does nothing but you just use a joystick

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.069 
does nothing but you just use a joystick
I<00:03:34.290> felt<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.540> gameplay<00:03:36.540> control<00:03:36.900> was

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
I felt that the gameplay control was

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.440 
I felt that the gameplay control was
actually<00:03:37.409> smoother<00:03:38.219> and<00:03:38.579> more<00:03:38.609> responsive<00:03:38.849> on

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
actually smoother and more responsive on

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.080 
actually smoother and more responsive on
the<00:03:39.750> Atari<00:03:40.079> version<00:03:40.609> another<00:03:41.609> surprise<00:03:42.060> for

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
the Atari version another surprise for

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.949 
the Atari version another surprise for
me<00:03:42.620> because<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.920> all<00:03:44.040> know<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.219> the

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
me because we all know that the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.119 
me because we all know that the
colecovision<00:03:45.959> version<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.500> pretty<00:03:46.769> much<00:03:46.920> pure

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
colecovision version is pretty much pure

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.490 
colecovision version is pretty much pure
and<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:48.569> pretty<00:03:48.750> much<00:03:48.840> thought<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.260> Atari

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
and I pretty much thought the Atari

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.929 
and I pretty much thought the Atari
version<00:03:49.859> was<00:03:49.980> even<00:03:50.250> bigger<00:03:50.760> pilot<00:03:52.939> but

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
version was even bigger pilot but

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.479 
version was even bigger pilot but
honestly<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.659> was<00:03:54.989> wrong<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.530> mean<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.189> Atari

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
honestly I was wrong I mean the Atari

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.849 
honestly I was wrong I mean the Atari
version<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:57.060> felt<00:03:57.510> was<00:03:57.750> superior<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
version I felt was superior to the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.759 
version I felt was superior to the
colecovision<00:03:59.489> version<00:04:00.079> that's<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.379> pretty

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
colecovision version that's a pretty

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.970 
colecovision version that's a pretty
rare<00:04:02.099> feat<00:04:03.500> typically<00:04:04.500> when<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> game<00:04:04.950> is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
rare feat typically when a game is

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.280 
rare feat typically when a game is
released<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.579> both<00:04:05.760> platforms<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:06.719> for

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
released on both platforms like that for

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.780 
released on both platforms like that for
all<00:04:07.409> three<00:04:07.620> platforms<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> time<00:04:08.579> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
all three platforms of the time the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.199 
all three platforms of the time the
intellivision<00:04:09.209> Atari<00:04:10.109> colecovision<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
intellivision Atari colecovision the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.819 
intellivision Atari colecovision the
Atari<00:04:12.569> was<00:04:12.689> usually<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.319> inferior<00:04:14.129> version

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
Atari was usually the inferior version

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.339 
Atari was usually the inferior version
and<00:04:16.829> while<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.459> said<00:04:17.729> for<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.349> case

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
and while that can be said for the case

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.480 
and while that can be said for the case
here<00:04:19.590> graphically<00:04:21.229> everything<00:04:22.229> else<00:04:22.490> being

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
here graphically everything else being

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.490 
here graphically everything else being
equal<00:04:23.729> it's<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.660> think<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.080> better<00:04:25.169> playing

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
equal it's I think it's a better playing

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.969 
equal it's I think it's a better playing
game<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.949> Atari<00:04:26.510> go<00:04:27.510> figure<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.770> yeah
