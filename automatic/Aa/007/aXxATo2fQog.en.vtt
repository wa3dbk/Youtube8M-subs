 http://www.dbsply.com-Comparison review site for indoor radio control helicopters and toy helicopters- 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 It is infrared 3ch toy helicopter which carries aerial photography camera which is usable as WEB camera 

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:17.167
 The SWAT HELI is also named. 

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:27.401
 English only on the package exterior 

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:33.401
 Type of packaging is embedded in Styrofoam 

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:40.734
 Instruction manual, accessories taped to the back 

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:48.667
 The instruction manual is only English version, there is no Japanese version 

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.667
 Controller is standard as infrared 3ch helicopter 

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:07.401
 Of the four color variations, this is a camouflage color 

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:14.467
 Camera goes to the cockpit of the nose ... 

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:20.467
 The appearance is quite elaborate design 

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.234
 Spare parts are only one tail propeller 

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:33.134
 USB charging cable is also included standard 

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:39.834
 This is a USB cable for media transfer 

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:45.134
 Stand when used as a web camera 

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:55.801
 Controller is AA batteries x 6 

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:08.234
 The charging connector is on the left side of the machine 

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:22.267
 Of course you can charge from USB 

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:33.767
 Fixation of the helicopter feels like putting on the skid ... 

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.567
 Unexpectedly, I'm getting sorry ... 

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:49.367
 As recording media is built-in, transfer to PC is this USB cable ... 

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:03.434
 There is an impression that takeoff is slightly swaying ... 

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:09.301
 The hovering is so so and stable? 

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:16.434
 It seems that the rotation movement is crooked, but forward / backward is a good impression of a non-billionaire. 

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:23.601
 It is not as stable as Kyosho's Spymaster 3 + 1, but it seems to be able to fly like a standard low-priced toy helicopter 

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:30.834
 Detailed flight performance checks, etc. will be another review ...
