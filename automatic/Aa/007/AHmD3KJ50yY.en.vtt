00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.910
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.320
 I am poker and today I bring you the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.460
 next episode of the weapon guide 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.260
 today we are going to talk about a weapon that 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.580
 I was in the call of duty black ops 1 and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.619
 I completely missed it 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.980
 have gone up before is the fncl as you see 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.390
 bid 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.939
 20 bullets of main charger sorry 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.730
 180 of secondary and good is a weapon that 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.020
 has shot of a single bullet ie 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.000
 to spend the 20 bullets in the charger 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.730
 we will have to press the button 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.379
 cited to shoot 20 times things that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.600
 we have but yes things that we have in 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.309
 against we are in round 34 as you see 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.680
 the zombies die but logically 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.440
 they need a few bullets 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.670
 so as I say the guide says there's 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.530
 what to do in high rounds I do not expect 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.780
 do it in such high rounds but good 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.690
 and get it a 34 because it goes up 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.400
 the 34 kill kill as you see they are going 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.830
 dropping zombies what happens that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.110
 logically in round 34 only a few 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.580
 few weapons manage to kill enough 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.710
 well no and do these retracted from the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.390
 lightning the lightning and all these the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.150
 we include also because it could be 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.549
 among them with m27 included also 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.970
 but the submachineas like that of cadence 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.120
 slow 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.010
 and more little things because the truth is that they are not 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.170
 very good to climb rounds points the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.730
 let's recover is to make a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 sub-machine mobility is quite fast 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.720
 also double type of prestidigitation 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 especially double shot and essential 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.020
 commented bazaar more prestige not so 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 important because the charger is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.350
 pretty fast and have the surprise that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 we take it when we improve it there goes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 he returns the same weapon to us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.900
 color but it's called wn if I'm not wrong 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.740
 there we have it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 wn 30 bullets of main charger 370 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.550
 of the secondary a total of almost 400 and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.970
 comes by bursts of 3 as you see 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.680
 bursts of three as if it were to the m16 and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 to get better 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 and well it gives us a kind of look two 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.640
 Sometimes I really do not know if the accessory is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 random or it always touches us 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.050
 I think always the same but good 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 kill kills pretty so improve like this 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.560
 it's worth not being the best 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.930
 but well I think it can be given 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 a pass and if it touches us in the box is worth 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.050
 we improve you see that we are both in 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.000
 the 35 the cendis are still dying 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.880
 logically, with a greater number of 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 bullets get two wings in the head and 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.540
 little more to say improving also 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 mandatory the double shot does not stop 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.380
 increase the cadence although it is true 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.450
 that increases the lack of gusts and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.830
 the prestidigitaciÃ³n is not necessary vale 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.540
 I hope you showed the video 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.190
 you know that life is hesitated and manufactured 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.420
 it helps a lot if you are not subscribed and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.530
 you like the content of it what 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.360
 you have to do just below this 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.370
 video clicks me but here to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.930
 subscribe or something or subscribe 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.550
 clicking here and nothing else st for everything 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.670
 to be happy we'll see you in the next 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.930
 videos and until next time 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.930
