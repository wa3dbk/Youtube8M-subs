having to give it about five more
minutes<00:06:03.180> and<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:04.170> reason<00:06:04.590> is<00:06:04.980> is<00:06:05.250> normally<00:06:05.790> I

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
minutes and the reason is is normally I

minutes and the reason is is normally I
make<00:06:05.910> it<00:06:06.240> in<00:06:06.390> our<00:06:06.540> ten<00:06:07.170> inch<00:06:08.150> pan<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:09.600> comes

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
make it in our ten inch pan that comes

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.900 
make it in our ten inch pan that comes
with<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.110> extender<00:06:10.500> ring<00:06:10.530> kit<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:11.310> the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
with the extender ring kit and the

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.670 
with the extender ring kit and the
infrared<00:06:12.420> is<00:06:12.570> able<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:12.960> really<00:06:13.290> go<00:06:13.440> through

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
infrared is able to really go through

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.330 
infrared is able to really go through
here<00:06:13.920> very<00:06:14.280> fast<00:06:14.880> and<00:06:15.240> well<00:06:15.750> but<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.890> the<00:06:17.070> the

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
here very fast and well but in the the

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.970 
here very fast and well but in the the
glass<00:06:17.610> dish<00:06:17.970> it<00:06:18.330> takes<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.750> little<00:06:18.900> bit<00:06:19.080> more<00:06:19.380> to

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
glass dish it takes a little bit more to

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.500 
glass dish it takes a little bit more to
go<00:06:20.100> through<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:20.640> that's<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:21.180> was<00:06:21.420> the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
go through so that's that was the

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.540 
go through so that's that was the
problem<00:06:21.930> there<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:22.350> if<00:06:22.590> you're<00:06:22.950> using<00:06:23.160> glass

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
problem there so if you're using glass

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.730 
problem there so if you're using glass
let's<00:06:24.210> just<00:06:24.390> add<00:06:24.630> five<00:06:24.960> minutes<00:06:25.380> and<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:25.560> would

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
let's just add five minutes and I would

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.340 
let's just add five minutes and I would
say<00:06:25.920> basically<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:27.330> all<00:06:27.510> your<00:06:27.780> casseroles

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
say basically to all your casseroles

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.950 
say basically to all your casseroles
