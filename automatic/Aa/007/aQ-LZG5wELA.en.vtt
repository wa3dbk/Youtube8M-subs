00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
sure they don't get too crazy you can

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
sure they don't get too crazy you can
use<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.200> rubber<00:01:07.409> band<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.790> put

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
use little rubber band like this and put

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
use little rubber band like this and put
it<00:01:09.659> around<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> root<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> try<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> as

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it around the root and try to get it as

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.789 
it around the root and try to get it as
close<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.299> scalp<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.900> possible<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> can

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
close to your scalp as possible you can

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.580 
close to your scalp as possible you can
also<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.460> beads<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.110> shove<00:01:16.409> them

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
also use beads and you just shove them

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
also use beads and you just shove them
right<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> root<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.140> that's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
right up to the root like this that's

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
right up to the root like this that's
not<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.470> effective<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> rubberband<00:01:20.549> way

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
not as effective as the rubberband way

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
not as effective as the rubberband way
but<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.680> rubber

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
but if you don't want to put rubber

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.929 
but if you don't want to put rubber
bands<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.340> hair<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
bands in your hair you can do that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
bands in your hair you can do that
another<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.140> helped<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
another thing that really helped me is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
another thing that really helped me is
root<00:01:26.159> rubbing<00:01:26.610> okay<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
root rubbing okay so that's just you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
root rubbing okay so that's just you
take<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.799> grid<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.939> rub<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
take your grid like this and you rub the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
take your grid like this and you rub the
route<00:01:30.720> basically<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.130> helps<00:01:32.460> keep<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
route basically that it helps keep the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.020 
route basically that it helps keep the
dreadlock<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.900> itself<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.460> collects<00:01:35.820> all

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
dreadlock to itself and it collects all

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.140 
dreadlock to itself and it collects all
the<00:01:36.060> loose<00:01:36.360> hairs<00:01:36.689> around<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> root<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the loose hairs around the root that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.340 
the loose hairs around the root that
would<00:01:39.570> normally<00:01:39.960> try<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:41.869> enter<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> whole

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
would normally try to enter in a whole

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.670 
would normally try to enter in a whole
bunch<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> different<00:01:43.680> gridlock<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.680> this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
bunch of different gridlock so this

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
bunch of different gridlock so this
route<00:01:46.860> rubbing<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.479> hair<00:01:48.689> would

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
route rubbing is what your hair would

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
route rubbing is what your hair would
normally<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> by<00:01:49.979> itself<00:01:50.009> except<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:50.909> sort

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
normally do by itself except you're sort

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
normally do by itself except you're sort
