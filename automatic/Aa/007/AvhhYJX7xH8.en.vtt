step is to verify all the connections

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.729 
step is to verify all the connections
this<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.179> going<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.359> tell<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.719> if<00:00:49.870> monitor<00:00:50.440> IDs

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
this is going to tell you if monitor IDs

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.369 
this is going to tell you if monitor IDs
are<00:00:50.949> set<00:00:51.129> correctly<00:00:51.280> or<00:00:51.910> if<00:00:52.480> all<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.109> IP

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
are set correctly or if all the IP

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.349 
are set correctly or if all the IP
addresses<00:00:53.890> are<00:00:54.039> set<00:00:54.219> correctly<00:00:54.370> or<00:00:55.000> if<00:00:55.210> there

addresses are set correctly or if there

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.270 
addresses are set correctly or if there
are<00:00:55.480> any<00:00:55.629> errors<00:00:55.809> in<00:00:55.989> there<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.710> next<00:00:56.890> step<00:00:57.010> is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
are any errors in there the next step is

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.009 
are any errors in there the next step is
to<00:00:57.399> initialize<00:00:57.879> all<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.149> displays<00:00:58.480> but

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
to initialize all the displays but

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.119 
to initialize all the displays but
that's<00:00:59.199> going<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.410> do<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.649> that's<00:00:59.769> going<00:01:00.010> to

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
that's going to do is that's going to

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.560 
that's going to do is that's going to
increase<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.609> brightness<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.359> unit

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
increase the brightness that the unit

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.360 
increase the brightness that the unit
can<00:01:01.749> be<00:01:01.780> actually<00:01:02.170> do<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.620> then<00:01:03.070> it's<00:01:03.190> going

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
can be actually do and then it's going

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.790 
can be actually do and then it's going
to<00:01:03.519> reset<00:01:04.120> all<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.390> other<00:01:04.720> settings<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.740> are

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
to reset all the other settings that are

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.500 
to reset all the other settings that are
within<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.220> monitor<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.580> would<00:01:06.790> affect<00:01:07.120> the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
within the monitor that would affect the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.080 
within the monitor that would affect the
actual<00:01:07.810> picture<00:01:08.110> itself<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.490> is<00:01:09.550> important

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
actual picture itself this is important

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.450 
actual picture itself this is important
because<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.650> brightness<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.190> unit

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
because when the brightness of the unit

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.100 
because when the brightness of the unit
goes<00:01:12.610> all<00:01:12.760> the<00:01:12.790> way<00:01:12.880> up<00:01:13.150> that's<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.020> be

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
goes all the way up that's going to be

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.080 
goes all the way up that's going to be
it's<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.500> allow<00:01:14.620> us<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.800> determine<00:01:15.730> what

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
it's going to allow us to determine what

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's going to allow us to determine what
brain<00:01:16.270> is<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:16.510> can<00:01:16.630> measure<00:01:16.780> there<00:01:17.080> we<00:01:17.200> can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
brain is we can measure there we can

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.710 
brain is we can measure there we can
calibrate<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.830> entire<00:01:18.100> wall<00:01:18.400> -<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:19.480> next

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
calibrate the entire wall - the next

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.360 
calibrate the entire wall - the next
step<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.200> measure<00:01:20.410> all<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.710> all<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
step is to measure all of all the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.790 
step is to measure all of all the
displays<00:01:21.730> so<00:01:22.510> when<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.080> step<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.440> when<00:01:23.680> this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
displays so when this step is when this

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.950 
displays so when this step is when this
step<00:01:23.980> is<00:01:24.100> being<00:01:24.310> done<00:01:24.550> each<00:01:25.180> screen<00:01:25.600> is<00:01:25.750> going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
step is being done each screen is going

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.080 
step is being done each screen is going
to<00:01:26.050> be<00:01:26.140> given<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.830> set<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.070> test<00:01:27.340> patterns<00:01:27.700> that

external<00:01:32.460> sources<00:01:33.460> are<00:01:33.700> necessary<00:01:34.210> when<00:01:34.450> do

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
external sources are necessary when do

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780 
external sources are necessary when do
utilizing<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.500> then<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.160> final<00:01:36.490> step<00:01:36.670> is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
utilizing this then the final step is

utilizing this then the final step is
going<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:37.030> be<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.450> calibrate<00:01:37.870> all<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.170> units

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
going to be to calibrate all the units

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.810 
going to be to calibrate all the units
this<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.070> step<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.280> I'm<00:01:39.490> going<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.670> show

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
this is the step that I'm going to show

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.880 
this is the step that I'm going to show
you<00:01:39.850> right<00:01:40.120> now<00:01:40.320> again<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> bunch<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.680> test

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you right now again a bunch of test

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.260 
you right now again a bunch of test
patterns<00:01:42.250> are<00:01:42.370> going<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.640> appear<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.060> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
patterns are going to appear on the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.420 
patterns are going to appear on the
screens<00:01:43.540> themselves<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.230> then<00:01:44.650> we're<00:01:45.310> going

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
screens themselves and then we're going

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.280 
screens themselves and then we're going
to<00:01:45.460> utilize<00:01:45.730> our<00:01:46.000> color<00:01:46.270> sensor<00:01:46.690> to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
to utilize our color sensor to

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.080 
to utilize our color sensor to
communicate<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.130> software<00:01:48.550> itself<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
communicate with the software itself and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.620 
communicate with the software itself and
actually<00:01:49.360> calibrate<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.260> displays

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
actually calibrate the displays

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.240 

so<00:01:53.229> now<00:01:53.320> we're<00:01:53.470> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> color<00:01:53.830> calibrate

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
so now we're going to color calibrate

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.530 
so now we're going to color calibrate
our<00:01:54.280> second<00:01:54.729> screen<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.030> match<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.299> first

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
our second screen to match the first

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
our second screen to match the first
screen

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.999 

so<00:02:08.880> again<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> point<00:02:09.600> now<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.009> software

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so again at this point now the software

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.380 
so again at this point now the software
itself<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.370> communicating<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> look-up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
itself is communicating with the look-up

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.000 
itself is communicating with the look-up
tables<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> second<00:02:13.319> screen<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.920> it's

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
tables in the second screen now and it's

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.140 
tables in the second screen now and it's
going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> adjust<00:02:14.819> those

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to it's going to adjust those

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.980 
going to it's going to adjust those
look-up<00:02:15.480> tables<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.930> match<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.530> first<00:02:16.709> screen

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.500 

so<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.820> we've<00:02:24.060> cut

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so there you go so now that we've cut

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.550 
so there you go so now that we've cut
now<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.840> we've<00:02:24.930> calibrated<00:02:25.140> both

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
now that we've calibrated both

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.080 
now that we've calibrated both
brightness<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.220> intensity<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.730> our<00:02:26.910> two

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
brightness and intensity of our two

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.310 
brightness and intensity of our two
units<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.540> creates<00:02:27.780> creates<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.200> better

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
units it creates creates a better

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.680 
units it creates creates a better
illusion<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.120> single<00:02:30.450> image

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
illusion of a one of a single image

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.960 
illusion of a one of a single image
across<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.350> entirety<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.890> wall<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.820> more
