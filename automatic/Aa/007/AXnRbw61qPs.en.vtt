element

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
element

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.850 
element
look<00:01:55.630> at<00:01:55.750> where<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:55.990> started<00:01:56.380> there<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:56.800> very

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
look at where it started there it's very

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.270 
look at where it started there it's very
squared<00:01:57.340> off<00:01:57.520> there<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.280> where

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
squared off there really is that where
