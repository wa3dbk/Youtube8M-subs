after<00:01:07.399> you<00:01:07.460> peel<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.729> out<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> go<00:01:09.140> ahead<00:01:09.319> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
after you peel it out is to go ahead and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.620 
after you peel it out is to go ahead and
rinse<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.490> way<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.729> make<00:01:11.149> sure<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.360> you

rinse it that way you make sure that you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.100 
rinse it that way you make sure that you
don't<00:01:11.780> get<00:01:11.959> any<00:01:12.349> of<00:01:12.709> the<00:01:13.310> seeds<00:01:13.520> in
