 rain on the north and the west 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 However, its progress is slowed by 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.500
 a beautiful anticyclone stretching the Azores 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300

 anticyclonic time is taking place 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 with a lot of sun very little 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 clouds and a mass of air that is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 transition with certainly clouds 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 but less moisture the north no

 the paca region will also benefit from 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 a lot of sun and only a few 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 harmless clouds over the rest of the country

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.560
 could reduce the visibility in the
