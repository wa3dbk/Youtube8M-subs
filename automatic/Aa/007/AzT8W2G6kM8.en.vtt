00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.220
 let's make some fruit skewers if 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.759
 you do not want to lose any of my 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.759
 videos subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.650
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.860
 are 4 apricots cut into segments 2 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.830
 bananas a natural yogurt 2 tablespoons 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.560
 of lemon orange juice 2 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.320
 tablespoons condensed milk one 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.629
 teaspoon of cinnamon 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.550
 sugar and a little butter for 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.790
 the pan and the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.989
 is the yogurt sauce that will accompany 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.260
 the brochettes we will throw the yogurt in this 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.690
 bowl we throw the orange juice already 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.450
 then the condensed milk and 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.970
 we move so that everything is integrated 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.000
 because we have everything well integrated and 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.780
 is the perfect salsita we're going to 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.369
 cover and we will keep it in the fridge 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.800
 until we have the skewers ready 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.860
 then let's start the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.530
 bananas and assemble the kabobs 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 let's cut in taquitos like this or more 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 less 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.600
 we are going to take a little juice of 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.020
 lemon so it does not turn black and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.490
 now let's ride kabobs 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.490
 first a piece of banana 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.979

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.510
 and another one of apricot now on the contrary 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.580
 the banana 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.410
 and banana and we're going to make them all 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.200
 we will light the fire 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.110
 we will put it to strong fire at the beginning 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.739

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.739
 side 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.890
 once the time has passed we turn off the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.400
 fire and it's ready we'll take it out 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.710
