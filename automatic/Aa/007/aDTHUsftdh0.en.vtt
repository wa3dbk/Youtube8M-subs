00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.190
 today we all live on the wall 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.659
 but once again the original is different from the others 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.270
 i'll stand for horses 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.909
 is a profiled aluminum support 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.469
 with a particular shape 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.800
 which allows you to keep tableau both in a position for scale and therefore perfect 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.589
 earth looking for movies 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.369
 they are photographic contents 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.919
 that horizontal for navigation or otherwise for greater interaction 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.419
 with the tach screen 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.470
 in the box we also find plastic teething 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.950
 in these they serve to make greater stability to the structure then we will see 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.600
 how do they fit 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.120
 we limit the fake ipad in cardboard 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 and let's go instead add the cap 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.420
 we find the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990
 right direction 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.480
 elinca amazing simple because you insert before the lower part exists 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.589
 this kind of pocket where they find ipad cement 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.979
 ah obviously the openings in correspondence in all tiger titans 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.190
 the access doors 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.680
 and the mountain this also allows not to hold the ipad and directly in contact 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.580
 with aluminum then to avoid edition obviously scratch the device 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 already so the effect is very beautiful because it looks like a small television 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.630
 that hole you see in the front must be covered with here 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.140
 small pieces of plastic that I get pin up and that have the purpose of kijiji 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.810
 direct low that otherwise being discounted would have little stability 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.790
 theoretically, the very simple speech because they are two pieces of music 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.380
 they insert one another and that year they get smaller little holes where 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.439
 currently you can also enter 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 these two ground screws fix it even better 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.410
 these two elements must be positioned one on the outside or inside 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.080
 so that dancing with the stars 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.750
 r the aluminum structure totally succeeds 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.070
 the front part should be inserted from above into this slot and then pushed 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.510
 down until it fits 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.869
 there is only one. where waiting for plastic and thinner and that then 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.840
 comments use for 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.240
 he stuck in the crack away from there too 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.560
 the operation is not at all easy 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.490
 I don't know if maybe the model in which two thicknesses are not 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.869
 perfectly aligned 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.780
 and in any case, once the operation is completed, the problem can also occur 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.300
 it becomes aligned with aluminum because it remains somewhat alain instead 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.159
 in short, after long and exhausting attempts, I failed to resolve 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.529
 therefore I entrusted myself with bonvecchio 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 and even so it is not that it was pure. 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.769
 part the master life the villa 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.769
 it took some absolute time 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.299
 But in the end 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.529
 they succeeded but this is only the first piece now it's up to insert also 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.409
 the secondary part which 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.339
 go to the back and it must be slid until it snaps into place 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.679
 perfectly with the front part 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.679
 obviously here too a lot of what it costs 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.219
 but luckily I had not done 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.219
 then another couple of taps 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.909
 and we succeeded 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.530
 at this point we should go and put the two screws, however, with mind 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:28.129
 all the effort you serve grabs them, you will not go 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.129
 it's so funny to be alone 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.819
 let's finally put the ipad back in its portion 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.059
 I have seen that the joint is quite simple, fortunately 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.269
 it also looks like 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.659
 rather resistant 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.829
 on the back it is almost entirely open so you see apple and fifth block is 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.829
 very practical also to easily remove from ipad 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.619
 and just turn it over to have it in a perfect position for the structure 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.509
 or in any case to better interact with a tach screen 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.310
 in the world its primary vocation is surely that of video in one 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.239
 vertical stand position 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.419
 because as I said at the beginning so framed it looks like a small one 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.419
 TV 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.470
 writing ventilation is just the right one for typing 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 in maximum comfort even with the use of the two hands in short except 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.720
 those inconvenience I had seen regarding the assembly then to the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.330
 end the product is rather practical to use and also beautiful 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.530
 esthetically 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.460
 however it remains a rather static stand her that 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.500
 give the best if used within the home or sign up 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.740
 the final grade, however, above sufficiencies 7 star star melzo 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.520
 See you soon 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.050
 season
