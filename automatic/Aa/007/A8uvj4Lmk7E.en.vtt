actually<00:01:35.560> free<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.399> we<00:01:36.579> should<00:01:36.790> just<00:01:37.000> check

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
actually free and we should just check

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.260 
actually free and we should just check
that<00:01:37.479> as<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:37.960> preview<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.790> lift<00:01:39.790> up<00:01:39.939> and<00:01:40.090> make
