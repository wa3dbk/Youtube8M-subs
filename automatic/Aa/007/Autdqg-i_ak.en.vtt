12<00:01:49.970> players<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.659> think<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.020> only<00:01:51.200> one

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
12 players and I think this is only one

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.770 
12 players and I think this is only one
rare<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.430> don't<00:01:53.270> even<00:01:53.299> think<00:01:53.479> we're<00:01:53.689> gonna

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
rare so I don't even think we're gonna

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.649 
rare so I don't even think we're gonna

I sometimes think they're even better
than<00:03:26.420> 100k<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:27.049> 100<00:03:27.380> k<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.620> lot<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.950> blow

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
than 100k because 100 k is a lot to blow

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.819 
than 100k because 100 k is a lot to blow
on<00:03:28.280> one<00:03:28.459> pack<00:03:28.670> but<00:03:29.209> 35<00:03:29.660> k<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:30.109> obviously<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:30.739> as

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
on one pack but 35 k is obviously not as

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.280 
on one pack but 35 k is obviously not as
much<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.389> hopefully<00:03:32.389> we<00:03:32.630> can<00:03:32.900> grab<00:03:33.260> something

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290
