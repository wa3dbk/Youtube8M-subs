00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830 
similar to how Andy grew up with Woody
Jesse<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.640> Emily<00:01:38.880> were<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.270> close<00:01:39.600> but

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
Jesse and Emily were very close but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
Jesse and Emily were very close but
eventually<00:01:40.140> Emily<00:01:40.710> grew<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> gave<00:01:41.579> Jesse

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
eventually Emily grew up and gave Jesse

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
eventually Emily grew up and gave Jesse
away<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.780> let's<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.770> montage

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
away but let's look back at that montage

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.940 
away but let's look back at that montage
from<00:01:44.399> Toy<00:01:44.579> Story<00:01:44.610> 2<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> hat<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.560> Emily's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
from Toy Story 2 we see a hat on Emily's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
from Toy Story 2 we see a hat on Emily's
bed<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.549> very<00:01:48.119> similar<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> Andy's<00:01:49.500> hat

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
bed that's very similar to Andy's hat

the beginning of Toy Story also clues in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020 
the beginning of Toy Story also clues in
that<00:01:52.049> montage<00:01:52.799> show<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.490> Jesse<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.880> is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
but as time goes on we can

let's<00:02:13.340> recap<00:02:13.700> what<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.360> far<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.840> don't

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
let's recap what we have so far we don't

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.740 
let's recap what we have so far we don't
know<00:02:15.739> Andy's<00:02:16.250> mom's<00:02:16.489> first<00:02:16.849> name<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.720> also

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
know Andy's mom's first name and we also

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.990 
know Andy's mom's first name and we also
don't<00:02:18.319> know<00:02:18.470> Emily's<00:02:18.890> last<00:02:19.160> name<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.790> hats

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
don't know Emily's last name the hats

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.930 
don't know Emily's last name the hats
are<00:02:20.270> very<00:02:21.050> similar<00:02:21.470> based<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.430> clues<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.849> a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
are very similar based on clues of a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.570 
are very similar based on clues of a
time<00:02:23.150> period<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.660> montage<00:02:24.020> Emily<00:02:24.860> would

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
time period in the montage Emily would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
time period in the montage Emily would
be<00:02:25.910> old<00:02:26.030> enough<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.390> be<00:02:26.660> Andy's<00:02:27.080> mom

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
be old enough to be Andy's mom

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.830 
be old enough to be Andy's mom
so<00:02:27.830> could<00:02:28.190> Andy's<00:02:28.730> mom<00:02:28.940> really<00:02:29.510> be<00:02:29.660> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so could Andy's mom really be the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
so could Andy's mom really be the
original<00:02:30.200> owner<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.650> Jessi<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:33.650> hard<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
original owner of Jessi it's hard to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.790 
original owner of Jessi it's hard to
believe<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.420> mother<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.810> Andy<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.470> boy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
believe that the mother of Andy a boy

believe that the mother of Andy a boy
who<00:02:37.010> loves<00:02:37.250> his<00:02:37.459> toys<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.209> much<00:02:38.600> would<00:02:39.170> so
