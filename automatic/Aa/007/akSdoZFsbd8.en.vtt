00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.690
 you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.490
 Y 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.900
 Very good at all here is robot 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.520
 android in a new video and we're going to 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.970
 learn to make a compartment 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.320
 secret in a book is this book what 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.380
 first is that explain so then 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 you will tell me nothing this book is from a 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 melody of renfe 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.150
 it does not break for those who do not know it is 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.910
 a train company and gives a gift until 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.220
 helmets things when when you travel in 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.079
 they do not know how good the first thing 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.400
 let's do it's going to be mark a point 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.500
 for example 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.170
 this part will be the real one and this will be the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.480
 from our compartment then first 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 we will have to make a mixture in the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 which with a cup of water 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 but we'll do a little bit much 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.650
 and then with white glue 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 good the school glue mixed it 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.210
 extra as we will have to throw enough 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.890
 more than water 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.450
 something like that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.450
 and this we will mix it well 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 soft 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.270
 and then we remove the excesses of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.420
 brush and what we will have to go 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 making yourself look this part then everything 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 this now that is touring the and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.510
 comply 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 A) Yes 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.930
 well I'm going to cover it and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.820
 when it is finished we will be good 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.530
 when we have already covered all the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 you have seen times work so that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 surplus fell and did not stain the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.950
 blue part would be advisable that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.940
 I took a piece of paper and everything that was left 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.940
 outside and is doing 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.729
 this part 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.290
 As you can see, you have to press and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.290
 little by little it is doing well 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 A) Yes 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.160
 t 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.530
 when we have this dry what we will do 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.910
 I will give it another layer, then I will leave 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
 let it dry I'll give it another layer of 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 we will return well once it has dried 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.770
 our book here I made some 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 marks that is the box that I'm going to 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.110
 leave for my secret compartment and what 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.460
 we will be with a boxcutter go 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.920
 cutting leaves like this 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.920
 the measure I retire to despair 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.209
 This measure is optional, each one has 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.390
 left the space you want and left 2 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.670
 centimeters 2 cm and 2 centimeters since 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.819
 I have gone as far as I could 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.160
 and it will simply be the short and leaves and 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.800
 good is going to cut and when you have 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.260
 already quite cut I'll be fine and a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.209
 Once we have this, you see that I've already 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.890
 made a hole you do not have to get to 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.180
 the good ending that already depends tastes 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.420
 As you can see, I was raised 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.340
 it would simply be good what 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 we will see in the end what we would have to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.239
 do now would be again with cola and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.760
 water I have it here you see simply 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.730
 you would have to go through here as you have 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 done as we have done outside this 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.690
 Once inside what we have done 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.110
 now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.430
 and just like this all the time good I 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.920
 I will do it and then 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 well and once the result is finished 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.019
 would be something like this you see this would stay 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.439
 hidden and simply this would stay 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.120
 to follow without seeing a ticket would it be I who know 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.310
 something hidden in a hiding place 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.129
 simply here to hide is what 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.480
 you do not want it to be known where 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.370
 it is or that you have it 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 well you know here is what I have done 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.629
 has been to give it a double layer and outside 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.940
 as I had separated myself I have also 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.150
 done in this part up here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.489
 I also did this part is not left 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.739
 very good but good is together and how 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.810
 supposedly store will be tight no 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.380
 noticeable 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.690
 it would simply be that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.030
 that is, well, you know if it has 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.350
 liked to give like favorites to comment and 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.350
 well come on then
