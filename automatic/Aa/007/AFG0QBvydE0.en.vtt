00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 O 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.180
 Ok guys let's talk the line on 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.700
 first such is recommended 6 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 Chicken is of good quality here 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.990
 quality 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 color is ok and also the door or cool this 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.820
 here is a blue is not giving 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 camera agreement problem is cool for you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.330
 see line okay because this line is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.129
 here she will stay in touch with the 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.989
 The flight will be with fish because there 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.339
 any contact with boy text 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.460
 whip agent 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.570
 this is a more transparent line okay 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.190
 one more of the color of the water because there to this 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.750
 will end up getting more hidden in the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 world nobody appeared here you can 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 was not even flourishing that will not have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 No problem, only better for you. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 to see 33 right thigh has yellow 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 green and blue I do not know if you can see this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.380
 first of all good quality of line 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.050
 second of the galley 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 the coil always full is on the limit 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.850
 The one that is missing a little bit 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 are still always on the limit the more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 full farther you can make 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.149
 even though 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.180
 and how much thinner line farther 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.969
 will also goes the pitch is for example 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.729
 will be very much in the beach 0 22 statham 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.700
 is also continuing on the line is okay 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.490
 As for China but today the pitch is okay. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 I started to use the line 0 22 such 10 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.189
 2002 until the 26th at the most, but I 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 I highly recommend it to 0 22 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 is more than 150 grams 1 to 0 22 will not 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 reinvent is going but why are you going? 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.390
 start up and start 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.789
 goes from 10 22 in my case to some 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.380
 of them for example 40 22 he will give 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.710
 detail at 0 and 2 ending with 10 50 50 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.580
 can handle any rainfall 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.930
 Then we talked about a 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.800
 little niece also then okay 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.129
 good quality how much machina farther 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.160
 Ok I looked I looked at the reel always more 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.110
 full possible ok 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.990
 A few years, then, a little on the line. 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.370
 Let's talk about work, shall we? 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'm going to talk about several things here, I'm here. 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.120
 I have a model 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:59.420
 this one is a model to four meters and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:03.570
 20 is a shiita surpesa use on the beach 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.370
 da daniela goes three parts ok that reason 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.860
 the three parts two are more 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.080
 It's interesting to be longer. 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.390
 it may also be compatible 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.540
 with height is for example has a 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.020
 meters and seventy -nine women and 23 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:25.080
 lens ok also a part is of a 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.870
 another stick this one is three meters and 60 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.930
 It's what I recommend to you that way. 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.820
 I'm leaving for the beach or I 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.120
 I recommend that you go over 3 meters and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.820
 60 same you will never get 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.220
 the remedy tone ok then part at least 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.220
 of three meters and 60 that would be a vacancy 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.260
 of two parts is three meters and 60 is 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 then part to 360 and can even to 524 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.709
 meters 50 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.480
 I really like four feet and 20 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.900
 For me I would take the power but gave 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.080
 me 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.040
 Okay, but for starters then you have to 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.959
 from three meters and sit forward 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.580
 is less than 3 60 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.930
 so kaka that he will not you 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.750
 able to take that long pitch back 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.720
 and you have to do a set that is 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:21.870
 Here is're a stick is long as it 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.540
 removed the kers what is done is this 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.419
 this combination that makes this goes well 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.950
 so far it was about speaking on behalf of 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.930
 band talk but want to add more 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:36.630
 a detail is all for so much to sit 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.740
 that is the minimum weight it can withstand 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.140
 to throw the call the maximum weight 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.890
 it is for example here 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.169
 it goes from 80 grams up to 150 grams is 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.479
 this one okay 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.599
 dry the weight not always called 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.240
 let's at it's 80 grams and the maximum we 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:02.099
 She is going to try to throw it is 150 thousand only. 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.830
 because if you use a weight less than 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.199
 80 grams what happens the pitch him 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.740
 will not leave but there goes he is because 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:16.979
 she will not have enough balance 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.409
 to give the start is and play there is the 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.669
 call then it means if you play 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:26.339
 weighing less than 80 grams of 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.889
 The Argentinean will be cool, and she will. 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:34.770
 even because I said up to 150 grams is ok 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.539
 up to 159 beauty only with her up to 150 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.210
 and recommends that if in this case 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.339
 here is for example she will have 50 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.110
 great recognized huh up to 130 grams 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:45.089
 is whoever kills himself within her limits 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.379
 is not forcing her so she goes 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:51.870
 is fully within the scope of 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:54.000
 Security is there for you to use and it 's a 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.699
 the heaviest call ever is to see the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.879
 which can happen yet but also not 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:03.000
 It's okay, you could break it ok. 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.310
 and that's it is something this 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.870
 it happens that people do not 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.899
 turn on the casting of the stick then you 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.149
 when you go to buy stick near the 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:15.529
 model town will have there casting her ok 

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:18.990
 So always follow the casting. 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:22.949
 Start here with this other one here. 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.060
 here it goes up to 250 grams that goes up 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.770
 250 grams 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.589
 whoever was here could handle the 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.120
 second big pitch, ie the 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:34.229
 The most I can put in this one. 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.020
 250 grams of lead is a call from 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.300
 240 us then recommend that you place 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.580
 so we have 230 grams form if you are 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.860
 having that safety margin 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.620
 ok so I had to talk about 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.620
 It 's good to buy our sea 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.070
 So let's start with a 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.780
 item that I consider the most 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:05.020
 important since the beach area 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:05.020
 What is the environment?
