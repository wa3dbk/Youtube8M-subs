00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.360 

I<00:03:37.750> thought<00:03:38.410> one<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.590> my<00:03:38.680> favorite<00:03:38.950> aspects<00:03:39.340> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
I thought one of my favorite aspects of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.610 
I thought one of my favorite aspects of
18<00:03:39.700> 2009<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.690> still<00:03:40.930> maintains<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
18 2009 so it still maintains the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.260 
18 2009 so it still maintains the
fast-paced<00:03:41.920> arcade<00:03:42.430> gameplay<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:43.000> with<00:03:43.120> all

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270
