like anytime you're dealing with

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.600 
like anytime you're dealing with
prisoners<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.740> death<00:02:37.770> row<00:02:38.070> those<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.520> all

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
prisoners on death row those are all

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.370 
prisoners on death row those are all
going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.180> comparisons<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.050> are<00:02:40.140> made

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
going to be comparisons that are made

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.750 
going to be comparisons that are made
but<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.740> is<00:02:40.860> definitely<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.190> story<00:02:41.520> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
but this is definitely a story that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.520 
but this is definitely a story that
stands<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.120> its<00:02:42.300> own<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.900> definitely<00:02:43.260> has<00:02:43.470> a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
stands on its own this definitely has a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.520 
stands on its own this definitely has a
bit<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.040> magical<00:02:44.430> realism<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:46.050> that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit of magical realism to it so if that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
bit of magical realism to it so if that
isn't<00:02:47.100> something<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.670> enjoy<00:02:47.820> then<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990 
isn't something that you enjoy then you
might<00:02:49.200> need<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.860> prepare<00:02:50.460> yourself<00:02:50.820> for<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
might need to prepare yourself for that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.910

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
every character in this book is pretty

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.050 
every character in this book is pretty
complex<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.320> see<00:03:13.620> both<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.370> good<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.610> bad

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
complex you see both the good and bad

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
complex you see both the good and bad
sides<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.960> them<00:03:16.170> which<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.620> pretty<00:03:16.950> impressive

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
sides to them which is pretty impressive

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040 
sides to them which is pretty impressive
especially<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:18.330> again<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
especially because again this is a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.990 
especially because again this is a
relatively<00:03:19.620> short<00:03:19.920> novel<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.610> there's<00:03:20.820> so

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
relatively short novel but there's so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.150 
relatively short novel but there's so
much<00:03:21.120> information<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.960> so<00:03:22.140> much<00:03:22.170> development

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
much information and so much development

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.760 
much information and so much development
that<00:03:23.400> happens<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.120> story<00:03:24.300> or<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
that happens in this story or you get to

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.380 
that happens in this story or you get to
see<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.190> much<00:03:26.340> about<00:03:26.610> these<00:03:26.820> characters

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
see so much about these characters

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.660 
see so much about these characters
within<00:03:27.750> such<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.200> short<00:03:28.230> period<00:03:28.710> of<00:03:28.920> time<00:03:29.130> which

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
within such a short period of time which

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.890 
within such a short period of time which
is<00:03:29.760> probably<00:03:30.030> another<00:03:30.210> reason<00:03:30.300> why<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.630> loved

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
is probably another reason why I loved

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.630 
is probably another reason why I loved
it<00:03:31.020> so<00:03:31.170> much<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.650> author<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:31.980> able<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.310> provide

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
it so much the author is able to provide

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.510 
it so much the author is able to provide
so<00:03:33.060> much<00:03:33.270> information<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.200> depth<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.280> few

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
so much information and depth and so few

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.370 
so much information and depth and so few
pages<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.210> kind<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.540> almost<00:03:36.720> makes<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.140> wonder

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
pages it kind of almost makes you wonder

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.920 
pages it kind of almost makes you wonder
why<00:03:37.770> they're<00:03:38.070> books<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.760> are<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:38.910> 800<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.900> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
why they're books that are like 800 to a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.540 
why they're books that are like 800 to a
thousand<00:03:40.350> pages<00:03:40.500> long<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:41.010> feel<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.340> there's

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
thousand pages long I feel like there's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.100 
thousand pages long I feel like there's
so<00:03:41.670> much<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> could<00:03:42.210> potentially<00:03:42.510> talk<00:03:42.900> about

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
so much I could potentially talk about

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.660 
so much I could potentially talk about
with<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.380> book<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:43.980> there<00:03:44.310> are<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> lot

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
with this book I think there are a lot

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.580 
with this book I think there are a lot
of<00:03:44.700> really<00:03:45.120> interesting<00:03:45.150> layers<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.320> she

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
of really interesting layers that she

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.500 
of really interesting layers that she
slowly<00:03:46.890> reveals<00:03:47.430> throughout<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.000> course<00:03:48.330> of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
slowly reveals throughout the course of

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.910 
slowly reveals throughout the course of
the<00:03:48.630> book<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.050> were<00:03:49.140> really<00:03:49.440> interesting

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the book that were really interesting

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.670 
the book that were really interesting
just<00:03:50.430> as<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:51.030> slight<00:03:51.360> warning<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.020> obviously

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
just as a slight warning and obviously

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
just as a slight warning and obviously
because<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.040> takes<00:03:53.220> place<00:03:53.340> at<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.640> prison

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
because this takes place at the prison

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.460 
because this takes place at the prison
and<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.630> death<00:03:54.840> row<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.140> things<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.410> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and on death row and things like that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.290 
and on death row and things like that
there<00:03:55.770> are<00:03:55.920> topics<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.520> scenes<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.940> here<00:03:57.090> that

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
there are topics and scenes in here that

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.050 
there are topics and scenes in here that
are<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.630> really<00:03:58.050> really<00:03:58.290> tragic<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.520> there

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
are just really really tragic like there

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.850 
are just really really tragic like there
were<00:04:00.240> times<00:04:00.510> where<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.810> could<00:04:01.110> feel<00:04:01.290> my<00:04:01.650> chest

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
were times where I could feel my chest

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.970 
were times where I could feel my chest
like<00:04:02.460> constricting<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:04.770> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
like constricting because of just the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.250 
like constricting because of just the
horrors<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.460> are<00:04:05.700> described<00:04:06.240> in<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:07.020> book

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
horrors that are described in this book

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
horrors that are described in this book
I<00:04:07.470> would<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.830> like<00:04:08.010> stop<00:04:08.280> put<00:04:08.610> my<00:04:08.700> book

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
I would have to like stop put my book

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.420 
I would have to like stop put my book
down<00:04:08.910> go<00:04:09.510> walk<00:04:09.960> around<00:04:09.990> for<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> little<00:04:10.740> bit<00:04:11.040> and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
down go walk around for a little bit and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.610 
down go walk around for a little bit and
then<00:04:11.610> come<00:04:12.150> back<00:04:12.210> to<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.630> book<00:04:12.810> because<00:04:13.170> it's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
then come back to the book because it's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.640 
then come back to the book because it's
just<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.100> sad<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.510> just<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:15.990> heartbreaking

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
just so sad and just so heartbreaking

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.159 
just so sad and just so heartbreaking
and<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.790> makes<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.480> think<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.960> lot

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
and it just really makes you think a lot

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.050 
and it just really makes you think a lot
which<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.410> probably<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.370> best<00:04:20.609> thank<00:04:20.850> you

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
which is probably the best thank you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.760 
which is probably the best thank you
never<00:04:21.239> asked<00:04:21.480> for<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.989> book<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.410> book<00:04:22.620> that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
never asked for in a book a book that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.129 
never asked for in a book a book that
really<00:04:22.980> makes<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.460> think<00:04:23.730> about<00:04:24.360> your<00:04:24.990> own

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
really makes you think about your own

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.170 
really makes you think about your own
life<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> world<00:04:26.100> around<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.150> feel

life and the world around you and I feel
like<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.720> even<00:04:27.960> such<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.200> topical<00:04:28.620> read

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
like this is even such a topical read

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.129 
like this is even such a topical read
right<00:04:29.040> now<00:04:29.250> if<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.760> live<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.270> America<00:04:30.360> there

right now if you live in America there

right now if you live in America there

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
was a really controversial situation

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.210 
was a really controversial situation
