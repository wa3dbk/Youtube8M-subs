00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 this is the part 2 my instructions one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.730
 diagonally knitted shawls in this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 Part you see we the last triangle 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.360
 stuck the scarf is now long 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 enough in the middle part about two meters 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.920
 strictly or how long you like it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 the last triangle is relative 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 easy 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 you still have a little wool left 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289
 just as much for the first one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 Part more harms nothing less 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 is not heard after the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.930
 second row on where the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 Envelope crossed from knitted 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 is the first pattern series of part three 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.120
 the last three exists sends the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.180
 first two stitches right together 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.180
 strictly to the last two stitches 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 and the last two stitches were strict 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.730
 together again 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.250
 in the 20th 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 Just do it all 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 mesh only right 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.490
 yes that would already be the two 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 I had to show it again 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.240
 you strictly the first two stitches 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.800
 right along strictly to the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.800
 last two stitches right 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.150
 and the last number to the right 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.520
 together 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.120
 In the second row I had to knit you 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.330
 All mesh only right off the power 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.570
 here until only a few stitches available 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570
 are 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.550
 when driving four machine 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.820
 you are stretching the first two stitches 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.180
 right together and the second right 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.180
 together 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.340
 you would have a return journey now 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.100
 now the scarf is finished with it completely 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.730
 Great things are brought into shape 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.580
 short and pull it into shape when drying 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.160
 So it's really even 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.740
 if you liked the video 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.640
 but only this channel or like that 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.400
