and helicopter the toy helicopter has a

and helicopter the toy helicopter has a
shaft<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.360> two<00:00:12.570> blades<00:00:12.930> each<00:00:13.530> tilted<00:00:14.220> to

shaft and two blades each tilted to

shaft and two blades each tilted to
catch<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.940> air<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.480> move<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.929> helicopter

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
catch the air and move the helicopter

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410 
catch the air and move the helicopter
forward<00:00:17.099> or<00:00:17.220> backward<00:00:17.700> depending<00:00:17.849> on<00:00:18.300> the

direction of spin first Sergei spins the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
direction of spin first Sergei spins the
shaft<00:00:21.450> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.930> toy<00:00:22.170> helicopter<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.980> releases

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
shaft of the toy helicopter and releases

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060 
shaft of the toy helicopter and releases
it<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.510> blades<00:00:24.779> turn<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.439> copter<00:00:25.830> moves

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
it as the blades turn the copter moves

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
it as the blades turn the copter moves
through<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> air<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.810> second<00:00:28.199> release

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
through the air in the second release

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
through the air in the second release
the<00:00:28.949> blades<00:00:29.220> aren't<00:00:29.460> turning<00:00:29.850> as<00:00:29.970> fast<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the blades aren't turning as fast and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.869 
the blades aren't turning as fast and
the<00:00:30.600> helicopter<00:00:31.199> begins<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.800> tumble<00:00:32.220> as<00:00:32.400> the

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
the helicopter begins to tumble as the

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.509 
the helicopter begins to tumble as the
spinning<00:00:33.180> slows<00:00:33.680> now<00:00:34.680> we've<00:00:34.890> added<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.309> blade

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
spinning slows now we've added a blade

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.270 
spinning slows now we've added a blade
to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> back<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.629> helicopter<00:00:37.280> double

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to the back end of the helicopter double

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130 
to the back end of the helicopter double
blades<00:00:38.550> definitely<00:00:39.329> stabilize<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
blades definitely stabilize the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
blades definitely stabilize the
helicopter<00:00:40.800> due<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> increased<00:00:41.940> angular

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
helicopter due to the increased angular

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
helicopter due to the increased angular
momentum<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.579> they

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
momentum but do you think that they

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.500 
momentum but do you think that they
increase<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> helicopter<00:00:45.960> speed<00:00:47.329> we<00:00:48.329> also

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
increase the helicopter speed we also

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.470 
increase the helicopter speed we also
brought<00:00:48.899> along<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.290> small<00:00:49.680> helicopter<00:00:50.480> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
brought along a small helicopter the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
brought along a small helicopter the
smaller<00:00:51.809> helicopter<00:00:52.770> has<00:00:53.039> smaller<00:00:53.399> blades

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
smaller helicopter has smaller blades

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.660 
smaller helicopter has smaller blades
which<00:00:54.090> produce<00:00:54.480> less<00:00:54.780> upward<00:00:55.350> force<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.640> also

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
which produce less upward force but also

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.529 
which produce less upward force but also
less<00:00:57.329> mass<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.260> makes<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> easier<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> move

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
less mass which makes it easier to move

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
less mass which makes it easier to move
the<00:01:00.539> two<00:01:00.780> effects<00:01:01.289> tend<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> cancel<00:01:01.949> each

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the two effects tend to cancel each

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
the two effects tend to cancel each
other<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.570> double<00:01:03.989> small<00:01:04.320> helicopter<00:01:05.039> has<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
other the double small helicopter has a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
other the double small helicopter has a
large<00:01:05.700> helicopter<00:01:06.390> shaft<00:01:06.660> between<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.200> two

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
large helicopter shaft between the two

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
large helicopter shaft between the two
small<00:01:07.619> copters<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.479> works<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:10.549> on<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
small copters it also works well on the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
small copters it also works well on the
second<00:01:12.240> spin<00:01:12.540> Sergey<00:01:13.260> turns<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> copter<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
second spin Sergey turns the copter the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
second spin Sergey turns the copter the
other<00:01:14.430> direction<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> moves<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
other direction and it moves through the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.210 
other direction and it moves through the
air<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> opposite<00:01:16.770> direction

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.560 

finally<00:01:20.220> notice<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:21.000> happen<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
finally notice what will happen when we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
finally notice what will happen when we
combine<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> large<00:01:22.560> blade<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> small<00:01:23.490> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
combine a large blade with a small one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
combine a large blade with a small one
we<00:01:24.479> discovered<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.710> stable<00:01:26.250> if

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
we discovered that it's more stable if

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.920 
we discovered that it's more stable if
the<00:01:26.640> large<00:01:26.970> blade<00:01:27.330> leads<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.020> helicopter

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.550 

what<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:35.650> we<00:01:35.770> add<00:01:35.950> tape<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.550> one<00:01:36.730> blade

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
what if we add tape to one blade

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.380 
what if we add tape to one blade
although<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.710> helicopter<00:01:39.340> still<00:01:39.640> flies<00:01:40.000> it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
although the helicopter still flies it's

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.470 
although the helicopter still flies it's
definitely<00:01:40.690> wobblier<00:01:41.880> except<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.090> crashing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
definitely wobblier except for crashing

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720 
definitely wobblier except for crashing
into<00:01:43.750> walls<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.380> helicopter<00:01:45.010> works<00:01:45.250> as<00:01:45.520> well

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
into walls the helicopter works as well

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.150 
into walls the helicopter works as well
in<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> air<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.660> space<00:01:47.020> station<00:01:47.530> as<00:01:47.680> it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
in the air of the space station as it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.950 
in the air of the space station as it
does<00:01:48.370> back<00:01:48.640> on<00:01:48.880> earth

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
does back on earth
