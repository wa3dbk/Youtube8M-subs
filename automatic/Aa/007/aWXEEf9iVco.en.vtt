00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 Hi, we're here to make a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.279
 Wonderful recipe for you today. 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.580
 As you know, I love cooking and I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.859
 I put a picture on instagram for more 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 or less a month ago with rent 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.380
 functional 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 well I'll get it here it has 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 approximately 400 500 grams of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 Ground beef 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 I died a little duckling but more 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.910
 so you ask to take the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.200
 fat and then you lose to the currency 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 here there are more or less good ones 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.640
 average small note that he got a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:50.090
 great is not for the love of god 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 now the egg the dag the famous garlic parsley 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.129
 and now we're going to part of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.930
 differential is the flaxseed I'm going to throw 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.850
 approximately two tablespoons of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 Soup more or less, I'm going to put one 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 spoon of garlic tea so one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.229
 little water because I love the area 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 now I'll put a little salt 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.350
 and pepper 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.710
 but rather left one sold in the hair 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's time the mixture is smooth the hair 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.860
