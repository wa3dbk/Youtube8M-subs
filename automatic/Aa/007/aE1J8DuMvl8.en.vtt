00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.410
 wb people over to another video 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.330
 the changes on the pda it always goes 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.860
 still about revised champions and 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.660
 this time over tremmel you can see 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.490
 probably already in the splash art here 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.710
 the whole thing is essential from the team 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.810
 icy before he was such a troll troll 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.980
 he is faithful to whatever and now it is 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.119
 just be faithful to an ice 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.589
 accordingly were the skills 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.910
 still adjusted and how exactly 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.800
 looks like we always look now 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.029
 more exactly 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.199
 First and foremost I have to say that to me 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.999
 the new model really very good 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.650
 I like this topic looks like 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.900
 much more appealing than he 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.550
 faithful before also the model has one 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.890
 get more polygons donated 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.809
 and a red beard and gives it something 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.180
 to object to red beards 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.559
 I do not think so or well 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.030
 as far as the look was concerned 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.500
 Let us come to the skills and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 Of course we start here passively 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 by the way, by the way 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.449
 still identical to the old one 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.129
 passive is always when an opponent in 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.230
 our environment dies with the 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.059
 percentage of our maximum 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.530
 health as life again 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.480
 However, it is new here that we 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.280
 always two percent of our maximum 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.949
 get health before when the old 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.770
 passively what level 1 2 percent and up 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.759
 level 18 6 the passive one in level 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 ascended 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.960
 theoretically one can say that happens 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.369
 was just annoyed as a small consolation 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.869
 maybe the passive has a new one 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.280
 get names and is now king 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.640
 tribute to the new story 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.170
 von wandel wand scu always works 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.670
 really just like before here 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.380
 There are absolutely no changes now 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.700
 apart from the name and the icon 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.020
 here after we have the ability 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 activate our next 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.950
 Automatic attack additional 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 physical damage and gives us ne 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.520
 na.de bonus the opponent loses to the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.119
 half of the bonus we receive 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.439
 to have 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.210
 the whole thing is still a lot 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.000
 strong ability especially in early 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.969
 level with ex-beatle extremely efficient 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.469
 makes our how frozen domain is 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.390
 our old one as always 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.350
 similar but first and foremost 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.320
 the whole difference is natural 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.299
 much icy and less dirty 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 we will deal with the ability 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.030
 out and then ourselves in this 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.520
 are received 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.830
 recent attack tempo bach and one 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.450
 regeneration day means regeneration 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.340
 Of course, that springs like live style 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.200
 or our passive percentage increases 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.060
 are new in the ability here 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.740
 the lines was screwed and stop 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 this regeneration spa was before that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.580
 namely cc reduction but as I said 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.100
 here now through this new aspect 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.300
 can even replace skill in general 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.860
 I first say that brought 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.180
 was keeping up with this pay change 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 right now on the p which i of course 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.660
 can change is the more effective and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.610
 cheaper to apply 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.959
 also because we count regeneration 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.760
 in terms of colors, that's my opinion 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.140
 also more versatile we can do this here 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.489
 for example, on the floor when 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.230
 we just kind of kill monster or 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.030
 are traveling in the jungle and yourself 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 Regenerating more is natural 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.300
 pity that this cc aspect is gone 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.769
 because if we went for example 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.670
 and then drive and mcc if we do so 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.709
 of course, more heavily disabled the ice pillar 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.050
 is almost identical to our old the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.850
 Looked like the name of course here too 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.650
 again says the whole thing is icy it 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.080
 no more dirty pillar but one out 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.090
 ice here the slowdown is perfect 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.569
 also at all levels currently 35 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.760
 percent and not like the old one 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.040
 25 percent on 0 1 and 45 percent on 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.450
 Level 5 leads the way in the jungle 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.769
 This change mainly means that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.090
 we no longer here in this capacity 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.380
 so many points have to invest and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
 to succeed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.100
 one point is enough then we have 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.110
 the maximum slower effect and can 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.940
 a very effective pillar in length 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.060
 if we go against it and then 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200
 certainly grab the cup here 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.380
 Wandels ultimate also works 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.340
 like his old ultimate, it comes to me 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 as if I had that in the video 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.370
 The whole thing should be said more often 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.859
 not just being remake and not only 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.120
 fine tuning of the skills I appreciate 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.799
 he looks a bit different and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.989
 have to get up in icy but back to 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.760
 theme the ability itself is one 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.109
 single day pelli after we open it 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.180
 have applied one to this opponent 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.250
 a percentage of its maximum 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.200
 health and a percentage 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.060
 his armor and magirus teams cloud 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.250
 cloud means the enemy loses the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.329
 and they receive the same in 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.850
 the period of five seconds 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.650
 this effect doubles after 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.970
 we stole everything so after these 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.709
 five seconds where this effect 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.570
 doubles we lose ourselves 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.400
 this again over five seconds and the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.920
 opponent gets his original steps 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.810
 long and over these five seconds 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.520
 Overall, the ability is back 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.810
 We have been guarded very seriously 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.310
 Namely now steal a percentage 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.780
 share of maximum health of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.060
 goal and not just my solid 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.349
 worth moreover this doubling effect 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.540
 takes place faster , namely over 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.730
 five instead of six seconds and is on 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.200
 not simply evaporated away 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.780
 slowly over five seconds 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.270
 After that, that means that the total holds 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.169
 ability to last longer 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.490
 Generally, the ability is for everyone 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.410
 fall still very well suited to 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.240
 make liquid day even more stuffy 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.460
 or applied to the tank and yourself 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.510
 to make an absolute tank and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.850
 the tanks themselves a bit 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.020
 denied 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.280
 I can only conclude as a closing word 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.139
 say again that all really 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.389
 is much prettier to look at 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.610
 Of course, be sure and the model 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.500
 nice is also the skills 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.810
 Almost all were consistently 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.040
 thought and thus is walking bigger 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.600
 danger than before 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.430
 I personally would have been very much 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.169
 Have fun on the top line around 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.450
 that certainly more dangerous in the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.950
 Jungle as before so much of me too 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.210
 the topic I say then you can for 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.200
 watch and hope we see each other in the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.200
 next video thanks
