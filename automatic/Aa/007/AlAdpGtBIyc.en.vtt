00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.869 
bit greasy
now<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.680> wanted<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
now I actually I wanted to make this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
now I actually I wanted to make this
video<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.930> my<00:01:04.470> hair<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:05.040> wasn't<00:01:05.159> greasy

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
video but my hair actually wasn't greasy

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640 
video but my hair actually wasn't greasy
enough<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.720> coconut<00:01:07.049> oil<00:01:07.500> in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
enough so I actually put coconut oil in

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.789 
enough so I actually put coconut oil in
my<00:01:07.680> hair<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.310> make<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.490> look<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:09.229> it's<00:01:10.229> pretty

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
my hair to make it look like it's pretty

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.450 
my hair to make it look like it's pretty
gross<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.920> anyway<00:01:15.049> dry<00:01:16.049> shampoo<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.040> also

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
gross so anyway dry shampoo is also

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.620 
gross so anyway dry shampoo is also
something<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.119> use<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.479> you're

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
something that you can use if you're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
something that you can use if you're
doing<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.140> no<00:01:19.409> shampoo<00:01:19.950> thing<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.820> when

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
doing the no shampoo thing which is when

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
doing the no shampoo thing which is when
you<00:01:21.119> cut<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.710> mount<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
shampoo and switch to natural shampoos

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
shampoo and switch to natural shampoos
in<00:01:26.670> order<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.720> basically<00:01:28.290> retrain<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.310> head

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
in order to basically retrain your head

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
in order to basically retrain your head
to<00:01:30.119> stop<00:01:30.650> overproducing<00:01:31.650> oil<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
to stop overproducing oil now the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.770 
to stop overproducing oil now the
problem<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> first

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
problem with that is that in the first

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
problem with that is that in the first
few<00:01:37.049> months<00:01:37.320> while<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.130> cutting<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:38.579> on

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
few months while you're cutting back on

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.830 
few months while you're cutting back on
the<00:01:38.880> washing<00:01:40.490> your<00:01:41.490> head<00:01:41.790> hasn't<00:01:42.060> learned<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the washing your head hasn't learned to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
the washing your head hasn't learned to
under<00:01:43.380> compensate<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.090> lead<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> your

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
under compensate so it can lead to your

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
under compensate so it can lead to your
hair<00:01:46.079> looking<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.799> gross<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> while<00:01:47.670> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
hair looking really gross for a while so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
hair looking really gross for a while so
dry<00:01:48.960> shampoo<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dry shampoo is a way in that you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.719 
dry shampoo is a way in that you can
probably<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.360> through<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.110> initial<00:01:52.770> stage

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
probably get through that initial stage

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.149 
probably get through that initial stage
in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> no<00:01:54.360> shampoo<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.439> having<00:01:55.829> you
