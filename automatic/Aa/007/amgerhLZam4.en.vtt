capabilities it hits things very hard it
has<00:00:50.520> fewer<00:00:50.820> units<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.510> tougher<00:00:51.989> units<00:00:52.350> and

has fewer units but tougher units and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
has fewer units but tougher units and
that's<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.489> throughout<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> time

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that's the same throughout all of time

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's the same throughout all of time
for<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:56.370> Far<00:00:56.610> East<00:00:56.850> tends<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.420> very

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
for it the Far East tends to be very

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
for it the Far East tends to be very
good<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.930> swarming<00:00:58.500> many<00:00:58.739> units<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.699> units

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
good at swarming many units the units

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
good at swarming many units the units
are<00:01:00.149> cheap<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> disposable<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.789> Middle<00:01:02.789> East

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
are cheap and disposable the Middle East

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
are cheap and disposable the Middle East
has<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.110> mobile<00:01:04.439> buildings<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.280> means

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
has the mobile buildings which means

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
has the mobile buildings which means
that<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> send<00:01:06.900> an<00:01:07.110> army<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.920> new

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that when you send an army into a new

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.920 
that when you send an army into a new
province<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.880> example<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
province for example you're going to be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
province for example you're going to be
sending<00:01:10.110> mobile<00:01:10.619> buildings<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sending mobile buildings with it too and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
sending mobile buildings with it too and
so<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> Middle<00:01:13.049> East<00:01:13.200> actual<00:01:13.530> becomes

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so what the Middle East actual becomes

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.999 
so what the Middle East actual becomes
is<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.700> mobile<00:01:14.909> civilization<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:16.170> enter

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
is as a mobile civilization they enter

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
is as a mobile civilization they enter
every<00:01:17.369> new<00:01:17.520> province<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> base<00:01:18.689> ready<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
every new province with a base ready to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
every new province with a base ready to
go<00:01:19.590> making<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.549> extremely<00:01:20.850> formidable<00:01:21.689> foes

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
go making them extremely formidable foes

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.310 
go making them extremely formidable foes
in<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> world<00:01:23.430> domination

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.630 

there<00:01:32.320> are<00:01:32.500> hundreds<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.190> hundreds<00:01:33.580> of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
there are hundreds and hundreds of

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.160 
there are hundreds and hundreds of
upgrades<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.570> research<00:01:34.870> within

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
upgrades that you can research within

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.899 
upgrades that you can research within
those<00:01:35.380> races<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.250> allow<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.550> to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.600 
really needs to manage those provinces
correctly<00:03:53.350> that's<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.709> kind<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.920> optimization

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
correctly that's a kind of optimization

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.430 
correctly that's a kind of optimization
game<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.030> humans<00:03:55.360> are<00:03:55.450> very<00:03:55.630> good<00:03:55.870> at<00:03:56.050> edit

game that humans are very good at edit
glance<00:03:56.680> they<00:03:56.950> can<00:03:57.100> say<00:03:57.220> oh<00:03:57.250> well<00:03:57.519> that's<00:03:57.730> a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
glance they can say oh well that's a

so<00:03:59.830> I'll<00:03:59.950> use<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.370> one<00:04:00.550> optimizing<00:04:01.450> that
