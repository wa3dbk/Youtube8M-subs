00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.870
 hello everyone welcome to another video 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.250
 with new information of gta 5 finish 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.290
 to present the special edition in the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.939
 collector edition of the game and good 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.439
 Well, the first thing I'm going to say is what 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.050
 that comes to cost more or less each 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.000
 in the USA will be $ 80 the edition 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.770
 special and $ 150 the edition 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.600
 collector and well then I'll start 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.160
 already to tell more or less that they come what 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.809
 first of all is that if you book up 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.340
 the gta 5 or if you are going to book it already 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.170
 any edition is normal 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.960
 special or the collector you will be able to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.550
 have access to fly the zeppelin up 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.260
 now it was not known if it could be piloted or 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.030
 if it was directly just adornment there 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.620
 flying through the air and now they have said 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.120
 that for the people who book it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.890
 can manage the people who buy the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.390
 I play directly even though it's the same 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.219
 departure day if you have not booked it 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.600
 he will be able to control it and well 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.309
 we started with the special edition what 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.450
 first they say it's coming with a 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.070
 Special cover is not typical 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.629
 plastic cover that comes in all 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.670
 but games and a metal of 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.020
 better quality as we have already seen in 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.759
 several special editions of others 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.070
 games another thing that also comes with 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.930
 a map we have finally seen part of the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.970
 map in a photo or teaching the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.440
 these editions that are has been seen by 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.149
 end more or less a portion of the map of 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.830
 the saints as it is and well then 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.900
 we can do a little bit the idea of how 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.880
 the saints will be distributed 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.560
 a little of the saints the area of ​​the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.900
 mountains and the desert almost can not be seen 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.430
 but well something is something and well then 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.810
 this map in printed version is going to come 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.850

 25% more can be regenerated 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.130
 quickly the special edition also 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.150

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.370
 challenges so to see the stunts that 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.280
 you can do and pass for example between 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.840
 two buildings or things like that and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.670
 finally also things that have said 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 that will bring the special edition will be by 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.119

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.590
 They said they are a gun 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.240

 hammer to be able to attack as in the 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.620
 bay city that there were hardware stores for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060
 buy hammer or screwdriver 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 now a hammer is also coming in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510
 this special edition of gta 5 and good 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.070
 Well now talking about editing 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.680
 collector is going to bring everything I 've 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.840
 said now of the special edition more 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.620
 a few pluses like for example a 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.390
 bag 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.090
 I do not know exactly what it is 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.040
 refer to this will be to save 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.349
 things I do not know very well this is also 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 I do not see very well what it is and 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.560
 well in addition to this it also brings a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.540
 cap in which the saints put on 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.819
 front with the typical typography of the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.470
 cover of san andreas and well then 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.569
 now talking about content in game 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.860
 exclusive to the collector's edition and 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.209
 this is what makes me doubt if 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.709
 catch me the special edition or edition 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.030
 collector the bad thing is that the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.610
 collection this would be measured a lot of 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.840
 price 150 euros is too hopefully 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.209
 that these things that I am going to say now 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 they are like dlc and then they would take me 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.690
 special and then I would buy the dlc 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.180
 loose, I think for five or 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.319
 ten euros should cost and so I do not 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.640
 I would have to buy the edition 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.560
 collector because what inflates the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.560
 price in this edition are the cap in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.420
 the exclusive bag and well the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.549
 things without exclusive game will be about 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.799
 Other classic characters for 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.180
 the multiplayer mode said they were not going 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.530
 to appear characters from other genres 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.720
 in story mode because it 's as if 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.519
 it was another universe but like esther xxi 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.810
 they're going to come back in the multiplayer and 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.579
 for people who buy the edition 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.930
 collector is going to be able to use them 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.180
 to be able to be in the multiplayer with 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.510
 niko or with tommy vercetti for example or 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.709
 with cj 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.840
 things that you have to drop a hundred 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.970
 fifty euros to do this and it's 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.470
 too much have happened I believe and good 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.000
 then finally another thing that will have 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.890
 collector's lesson will be three 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.099
 new vehicles in story mode are 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.470
 will be about a car of the year 1930 that 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.060
 will call hot night hot rod this is a 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.010
 car of these typical old you are 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.659
 watching the picture racing cars 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.250
 old ones that sound a lot the engine 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.230
 energetic would come if there was one of these 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.120
 and the second vehicle also exclusive 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.819
 of the story mode would be a motorcycle 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.260
 exclusive that is called carbon rs and then 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.269
 apart from this the third vehicle 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.250
 exclusive of gta 5 for people who 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.650
