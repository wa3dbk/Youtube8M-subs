00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.120 

also<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.439> pro<00:00:23.480> has<00:00:24.480> dual<00:00:24.750> ends<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.529> normal

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
with AV cables our controllers

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.010 
with AV cables our controllers
controllers<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:48.960> controllers<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.590> that

let's<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> power<00:00:52.440> bricks<00:00:52.940> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.149> arcade

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
let's go to power bricks on the arcade

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.819 
let's go to power bricks on the arcade
move<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> tiny<00:00:55.680> r1<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> pro<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.870> make

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
move a tiny r1 and on the pro here make

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.510 
move a tiny r1 and on the pro here make
a<00:00:58.859> bigger<00:00:59.129> one

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
a bigger one

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
a bigger one
there's<00:01:00.390> nothing<00:01:00.690> different<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
there's nothing different with the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.070 
there's nothing different with the
actual<00:01:01.410> ends<00:01:04.580> know<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.030> actual<00:01:06.450> consoles

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
actual ends know the actual consoles

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.289 
actual ends know the actual consoles
here<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
here we go

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
here we go
big<00:01:09.299> obvious<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> disc<00:01:11.729> tray<00:01:12.920> pro<00:01:13.920> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
big obvious one is the disc tray pro is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.960 
big obvious one is the disc tray pro is
silver<00:01:14.750> arcade<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> white<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:19.200> new<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.220> new<00:01:20.340> pro

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
silver arcade is white a new a new pro

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
silver arcade is white a new a new pro
is<00:01:21.299> always<00:01:21.869> click<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> hard<00:01:23.100> drive<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.650> an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is always click on the hard drive and an

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
is always click on the hard drive and an
arcade<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> come<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.270> some

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
arcade is just going to come with some

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
arcade is just going to come with some
internal<00:01:27.840> memory<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.040> tray

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
internal memory with the little tray

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
internal memory with the little tray
here<00:01:32.570> nothing<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> front<00:01:34.290> we

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
here nothing different on the front we

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
here nothing different on the front we
have<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.659> two<00:01:36.659> USB<00:01:36.689> ports<00:01:38.119> two<00:01:39.119> memory<00:01:39.390> card

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have the two USB ports two memory card

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.350 
have the two USB ports two memory card
slots<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.100> syncing<00:01:41.460> clip<00:01:47.060> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> back

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
slots and the syncing clip on the back

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.030 
slots and the syncing clip on the back
here

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.110 

the<00:01:51.580> pro<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.540> notice<00:01:52.870> has<00:01:53.050> no<00:01:53.290> HDMI<00:01:53.980> slot

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
the pro the notice has no HDMI slot

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.710 
the pro the notice has no HDMI slot
because<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.240> already<00:01:55.390> has<00:01:55.920> HD<00:01:56.920> cable<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:57.720> HDMI

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
because it already has HD cable so HDMI

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.750 
because it already has HD cable so HDMI
probably<00:01:59.170> useless<00:02:01.890> since<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.040> pro<00:02:03.250> only<00:02:03.430> has

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
probably useless since the pro only has

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.820 
probably useless since the pro only has
the<00:02:04.060> normal<00:02:04.180> ones<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.780> does<00:02:04.960> have<00:02:05.170> an<00:02:05.290> HDMI

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
the normal ones it does have an HDMI

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.010 
the normal ones it does have an HDMI
port<00:02:06.990> um<00:02:08.460> same<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:10.090> tags<00:02:10.390> are<00:02:10.630> different<00:02:10.930> down

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
port um same the tags are different down

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.000 
port um same the tags are different down
here<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:12.400> notice<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:14.320> more<00:02:14.560> pictures<00:02:14.680> on

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
here you notice I have more pictures on

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000 
here you notice I have more pictures on
one<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.690> our<00:02:16.990> Ethernet<00:02:17.380> cable<00:02:17.740> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
one here we have our Ethernet cable it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:28.710 
one here we have our Ethernet cable it's
pretty<00:02:18.280> easy<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:21.270> USBs<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:27.330> these<00:02:28.330> are<00:02:28.480> your

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
pretty easy then USBs and these are your

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.980 
pretty easy then USBs and these are your
two<00:02:28.930> three<00:02:29.140> sixes<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.210> can<00:02:31.390> notice<00:02:31.780> any
