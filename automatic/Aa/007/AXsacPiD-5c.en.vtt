00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.750
 why in such questions 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.030
 and why one goal is that it should be both because 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.389
 actually not December 2001 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.859
 Hundreds of animals or verifiable 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.639
 it really is like that 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.920
 the birth of Jesus and the death of Jesus 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.920
 and quite peripheral event to that must be clear to us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.349
 the huge Roman Empire 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.630
 at the time of the imperial court there were more important things 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.079
 when that somewhere a Jew was born in Beijing 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.079
 that is also shown and correct for us 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.419
 we lack 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.850
 which was then crucified in the year 30 AD, a Jew took many 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 People crosses let yes 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.580
 that was also an event that 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.290
 not much attention is now no indication that this is not really 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.990
 but it was for the Romans who thought of Rome very much 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.190
 on the edge 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 Ltd yes 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.710
 what's wrong Palestine was as it were for Lower Bavaria 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.930
 yes, yes 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 around 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 that at the far way 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.900
 b 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.250
 the av-receiver was there but more expensive 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.430
 he has everything very much in the hat Jesus is born I now have with Lower Bavaria 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.340
 compared with that but emphasizes Dr 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.010
 With 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.280
 11 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.710
 there are some historical references to Flavius ​​Josephus the Critical 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.440
 Tori came around 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.620
 reports of a Jesus Christ Brandy SuS around 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.720
 the ml died and how many followers had 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160
 there are processes of 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.789
 Pliny's percent wish writers 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.780
 Message about the Christians 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 to message from the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 from the second century 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.030
 for a nice book from a DDR 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 Priests from Guinea 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.360
 Palestine at the Wanli in the Holy Land because finally from the GDR exit 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.310
 Kroll fit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 there appeared a book there is still the Holy Land 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.350
 and that's exactly what the Holy Land was about 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.600
 every level 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.160
 and described exactly how you can imagine that with the stand of Beat 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.110
 Life is great, yes, that's exactly about a specific area 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.610
 must have stood out astronomically at exactly this time 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.059
 very impressive we are interested in the subject of historical facts 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.349
 how one can not prove that is probably Inkherz 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.689
 Acquisition of this house has stood 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.059
 Percent also Loredo is yes 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.930
 So that's impressive in terms of historical 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.200
 Testimonies There was always the assertion that the Bible is saying that I am 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.819
 and where and when do I know everything 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.969
 that's not true 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.900
 There was a book mentioning 16 17 years ago and the Bible is right where 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.299
 It was said there was a deluge there was everything possible 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.529
 he wants to be reported 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.499
 that rarely happened that not only about the tool 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:45.649
 Darja Augustinus told Malta I could not even believe in the gospel 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.829
 believe 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.019
 The authority of the Catholic Church has not been said 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.389
 and that sounds like Sea 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.579
 violent but I could not do that to Jesus afterwards 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.569
 Christ does not believe 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.090
 What impression would Haye have? 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.319
 God would become man 2000 years ago and then he would become human 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.579
 would be noticed some say so and now you do with it what he wanted 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.670
 and he started off with path inspiration and so on people around the far 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.439
 but when man becomes if he does not become human at almost bar 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.669
 then he has to say that they do not touch us 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.879
 stay with us all »and two percent point through the Holy Spirit 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.969
 it's our topic today too 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.709
 and 2 in the concrete community 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.389
 around the church 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.569
 There were specific testimonies from Skippy Church with their offices in the series 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.719
 Archives with the Pope with bishops there are concretely water at the sacraments 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.339
 Baptism year Aspar 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.539
 not theoretically yes 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.690
 but for concrete is Forster 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.859
 Edgy in prayer 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.189
 Meet God del 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.479
 the PID is, so to speak, this Nat Nat of God 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.599
 proves 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.549
 the covenant 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.030
 believe that since this Jesus Christ was the Son of God 2000 years ago 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.489
 is that you can experience 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.629
 in convincing Christians the bravery of Christians today he is with 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.800
 give me life for this belief in Jesus Christ 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.560
 info then you can see the result at the second are many people should 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 Model has just been under the star 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.389
 how a person dies 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.609
 he hangs up 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.729
 that was a testimony that many atheists too 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.419
 very touched yes 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.490
 If this had left this faith certainty crashed 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.729
 then people did 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.169
 there grip that means it is a certainty I have 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.900
 that Jesus Christ the Son of God so again 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.599
 that he happened so 2000 years ago I am at it 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.650
 that you can not become the opec countries but only in one place 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.230
 yes times situation
