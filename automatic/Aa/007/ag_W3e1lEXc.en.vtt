00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.250
 free for those who do not know how to cook today 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.249
 let's do a typical preparation 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.579
 colombiana chicken in creole sauce with 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.919
 rice and beat the creole sauce is made 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:20.359
 with onion long onion bighead 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.890
 white garlic and ripe chonto tomato what 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.009
 first thing we do is put water in 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.109
 face heating in a pot we wash and 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.089
 medium peel the potatoes to ways is 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.300
 say we take away only part of the 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.610
 peel and we leave them in cold water 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 we wash and peel the garlic we are going to use 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.640
 a full head we wash and peel 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.149
 the tomatoes with your ripe 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 We go and peel the onion junca or 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 scallion 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.770
 we do the same with the head we cut 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.809
 on a table the long onion 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 making cuts along the most 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.699
 close as possible to each other 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 make a small cut from the beginning 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 and not having to go through this because 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.320
 bitter the onion then we join it the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 we hold with the left hand and with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.620
 the right we cut from above towards 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 down 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.470
 to completely cut 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.030
 we reserve 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.310
 crush the garlic with the help of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.090
 knife to make it easier to chop it 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 then we chop them first in a sense 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.689
 horizontal 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.119
 then in sense vertically 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.610
 sorry until you get very small cuts 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.480
 we heat a pot when it's hot 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.440
 add onions and garlic 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.780
 we mix and cook over low heat 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.850
 we cut the big onion in stockings 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.880
 moons and we add it in the other onion 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.780
 we let it cook we cut the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.230
 tomatoes first in half then what 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 taking long strips then give 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.440
 the return and we cut again to what 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.820
 width to get small cubes when 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 we have finished doing this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.420
 we go over with the knife cutting 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.390
 again to get a consistency 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 of sauce we take the onion to the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.290
 edges of the pot and in the center 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.830
 we put the chicken that in this case is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.140
 leg allows without skin and without fat 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.950
 we raise the fire let it brown slightly 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.690
 we turn the chicken around and let it last 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 on the other side you can use any 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.760
 piece of chicken 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.700
 we arrange the pieces of chicken in the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.600
 pot add the potatoes without water the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.990
 we put in the pot add the tomato 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.990
 chopped 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.129
 Water 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.670
 until it completely covers the chicken and 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.670
 potatoes 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.680
 we cover up we reduce the fire and leave 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.680
 Cook 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.000
 approximately for 20 minutes while 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.010
 so much we are going to cut the paprika in 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.140
 pieces that we are going to use we cut 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.530
 again and carefully with a knife 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.660
 sharp on a cutting board 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.660
 we remove the seeds and the white part 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.300
 we turn around and remove with 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.700
 take care of the house 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.700
 this so that it does not feel bad to the stomach 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.390
 when we have done this we cut in 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.769
 thin strips on the table we uncover 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.329
 the pot and add the paprika to the stew 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.139
 we put a pot to heat add 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.090
 half a teaspoon of garlic oil this is 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.269
 to make rice 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.540
 we slightly brown rice very 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.300
 well excuse the garlic moving it from a 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.660
 side by side so you do not burn 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.220
 we add a rice well 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.420
 two wells of water that we had 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.460
 warming up from the beginning that is already 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.880
 boiling this helps us accelerate the 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.010
 cooking process 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.080
 we mix we add salt we try 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.030
 we decrease the fire to the minimum and leave 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.800
 cooking let's prepare now the water 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.060
 tila this the uat and the one that is known 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.980
 also with the name exhibits 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.580
 we started to fight with a knife 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.820
 small then we cut it 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.700
 in this way supporting the in the table 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.560
 we cut it into large pieces this part 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.130
 we have to remove the little one very 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.680
 fibrous and hard we call heart and 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.090
 that heart we discard cut with 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.910
 a small knife what remained of 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.430
 peel we wash and cut first what 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.970
 long and then how wide to get 4 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.630
 we put a pot with water on the fire 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.510
 we add a little salt add the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.320
 water tila 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.210
 cover and let cook for 10 minutes 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.700
 After this time we uncover with 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.800
 the tip of a knife we check and already 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.780
 is cooked and the knife enters 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.940
 easily and crosses the uat and the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.070
 this list we take all the water and 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.930
 reserved we reviewed our stew 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.090
 chicken we try and it's already with a knife 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.610
 if it comes easily and leaves no blood in 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.130
 the liquid is ready, it is also thick 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.070
 if it's like at this point we turn off the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:37.390
 fire plug and reserve we review the 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:40.750
