00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110
 I will 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.100
 It is a table that is helping the amulet is today 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.020
 Let's add a groove using ghost notes 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.530
 I think I will do an exercise 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.530

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.920

 This Tteyuu has become cunning and I do not anything not caught 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.610
 Playing the notes sound Toka is to teach picking but I do not have the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.190
 It sounds like this kind of percussive sound 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 Such a 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.310
 It is a technique that the group comes out very coolly by putting the note 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 Right 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.170
 By watching this video 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 The song I was playing until now is more cool 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.700
 To be 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.500
 I am using the I think you kinda simple tune like to introduce the exercise after all this 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.480
 Because it is fun to use the song instead of the practice exercise idiot 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 Easy to wear 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.870
 The song I want to do is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.880
 I'm Zubarigege no Kitaro

 Genital area 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 Hm 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.290
 Since this it is is the finger style 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.070
 I would like to do pinger picking using 8 dreams 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.940
 From a now of Melo This really it's simple but plateau 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.160

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.840
 That's summons 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.500
 It is a riff 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.770
 It is said how to put a groove on this 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.290
 I will exercise my right hand first 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:43.219
 I 'm here and I'm a limit couple and I'm going to mute and let's go 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.219
 Is that the sound does not sound 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:55.760
 If you just mute some Kochi , for example, if you pull the connection , it's the sound of a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.290
 And Luton are you touching it family will muted network 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.950

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.950
 Lively 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.000
 I want you to do thumb 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:16.890
 I use only two index fingers for picking 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.280
 Ghost Tower Picking Now and mute the sound and press at once 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:25.300
 I like this move 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.650
 There are many after fingers 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.050
 It's kind of like this bounces with shuffle rhythm 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.920
 I will do my best 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.920

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.730
 Let's pull the devil that has adapted to this 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.730
 To go 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.180
 It is good to say that ghost and ghost will be in the mouth 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.440

 Follow 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.910
 It's been a while, I think it's a little bit gloomy feeling a little 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.009
 Because there is not enough , percussion distribution is added to this, isn't it? 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.950
