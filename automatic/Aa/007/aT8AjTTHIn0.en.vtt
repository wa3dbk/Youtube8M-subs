00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.069
 so for those who had acquired and more cars using 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.069
 food has arrived on the rise 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.099
 in fact it's a crazy thing I've never seen so many four 4 months of all my 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.419
 life and we are in a small bled called pacsÃ©s a nothing exceptional 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.509
 but the subject is so 6 may know n 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.530
 in the space of a few minutes the wrong 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.269
 here we go 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.650
 here I am reminiscent when shot in one of the poorest countries - have 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.300
 there too 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.300
 even more the patois equipped for the poor 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.200
 place at the key 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 I think it's the smallest model they want to read 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 it's funny but the metals sector in particular 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.340
 That's the point 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.359
 6 he interrupts the rest to help men 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.310
 we dressed some bags of rice that fell from the truck 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 it's a real festival 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.809
 and this video is done without special effects 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.089
 gold I am with sensor who had the highest density funny his mandate 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.969
 start 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.969
 kapakis those waters rise the day before 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:44.209
 on the planet earth 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.019
 so continue to send your donations percent 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 pity that sense now 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.989
 I tried to keep the wheel running in thai 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.329
 so for the little story I would have shot these images on space 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:26.729
 Golden 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.729
 but barely five minutes 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.799
 it's a crazy thing 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.149
 ok it's not catch 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.240
 I am quite surprising still deadlock could in a bled of 20000 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.020
 inhabitants in tears
