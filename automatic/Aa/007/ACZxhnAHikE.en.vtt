00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.679
 he who died a single day that scheme 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.300
 what else in numeration numbering in nothing more and nothing less 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.400
 what part of the bugle part of the mathematics 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 it's amazing and write the numbers correctly 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.659
 Then I asked musk 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.710
 what things are 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.839
 mockus 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.920
 young is not only nothing more and nothing less 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.830
 a mathematical client 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.000
 that is, in a few words 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.810
 is that the idea 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.070
 That idea 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 of what comes cesc amount 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.190
 and that numbers appear allows us to quantify the objects that surround us 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 so 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.740
 yes I think that there is that I think it is a mathematical entity then you go to 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.260
 imagine 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.489
 no, it's not like that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250
 You imagine 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 for example that this number 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.610
 how I will present what is in your head 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.950
 that name 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.900
 it is a point that we are going to represent 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.440
 numeraries 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.580
 it was found that those presenting atlantic 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.450
 if we do not want to represent 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.080
 we are going to present 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.430
 through a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.560
 and that his numeral pundonor be recorded in the graphic representation 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160
 this name thought 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.580
 Well, how did he try to burst 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 goes behind 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 with that figure 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 cuomo otherwise not for example how are the Romanians 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.260
 We also have to know if this is not the case and different manifestations that 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.710
 we can 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.400
 spies in that name 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 how they weave before 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.580
 I'm here I called you enjoy cij 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.750
 we all have to ask 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.900
 it's a number 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 a young figure is nothing more or nothing less 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.060
 they are conventional symbols 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.740
 that we are going to use 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.820
 to represent correctly 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.190
 to the guys 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.230
 for music also that other name 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 I will kill you well 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.309
 to the quote of benzema digit 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.529
 then which figures for and sites that we know 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.369
 good two impetus work with the figure zero 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.510
 with the figure 1 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.909
 with the number 2 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.159
 the figure three days and this figure is cemented 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.639
 very well more than the number increase 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.559
 The combinations of them form posthumously to us 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.269
 we are using 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.979
 nowadays 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.330
 tuchel next to a post that kunkel the world 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.169
 as in so many other colleagues 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.649
 comparing 8524 we show yes no 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:57.169
 October eight thousand 184 cluster altitude 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.289
 this is a crime 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.659
 make a set of rules 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.389
 this way that does not exist is that everything is correctly 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.409
 express 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.409
 he said that by using the position system of the trade 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.619
 the next 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.329
 in the prison system lucense things 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.049
 with a set of rules and principles 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.259
 that allowed us 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.510
 by mother presenting the numbers in a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.329
 proper and correct 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.819
 according to cc oo the main ones 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 beginning 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.259
 the numbering 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.419
 ximo puig and the physical because at the beginning 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.419
 at the beginning the Basque Olympian 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.079
 in this difficult moment 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.889
 kerviel by niki place 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.289
 that tells us explicitly from the computer 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.689
 they tell us that it is expensive figures 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.749
 moisture 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.749
 gin a curb and a specified place 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.949
 I do not decide specific 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.030
 number 8 thousand and 1 34 that does not place you respectively 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.609
 inscription 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.809
 place without being wanted right and the right-left links 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.690
 first of all I want to say that it is the first place your two children to be the worst 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.519
 place 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.930
 so after five in the second place 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.270
 well protect the third place and mexico 4 Oct 4 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.159
 he found it with a cut-out context of 0 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.460
 with zero fumes 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 in increasing order 1 order 2 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.370
 and we would have 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.370
 the places of each 100 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.730
 we see that this demands a lot 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.430
 this numeral 7 400 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.039
 or that you realize the account is that it grew to give a figure for example the 5 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:46.919
 and it's smoke 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.120
 its respective place 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.969
 and over cultivation by 20 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.039
 we do not realize it is to notice the can that it demands that its sister has 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.090
 five examples are 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.330
 fat in the place because in two the same way 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.960
 just for that reason 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.520
 but in any case exemplary 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.970
 place four for the being when it gives me 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.120
 4 the xunta 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.490
 in the first of all the rumors 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.600
 it's a story that a number 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.930
 copeco 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.400
 if we add to that their respective place that their respective order 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.430
 he will always give us 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.470
 alak before and fresquitos of the profit always what we are arriving 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.889
 let's see an application 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.479
 how much situation of haidar 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.240
 which complicates their fourth-level children 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.020
 is taking third place 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.240
 chile took over account mode 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.430
 we had that problem of wanting to promote export 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 spare as to exit according to the phrase used before 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.680
 4 + 3 7 does not add anything 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.020
 let's check 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.729
 I suppose the figure that is not asking for extremes - here 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.400
 a greeting 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.830
 what happens 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.470
 that figure which place is in third place after stopping it in that they are 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.279
 desert to right 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.409
 is increasing tonight they brought 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:02.669
 I wanted to decrease 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.689
 like cockroach that place 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.520
 Sterling figure toshack ranks second 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.339
 outside dec the figure worries in the first place 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:12.759
 nothing more aitana xix 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.439
 mc that are integers 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:18.889
 his place is olhanense that Ecuadorians are this shabby figure a crystal 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.839
 and in the hash room 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.249
 we see that those of cleanliness that being of Christian right 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.249
 is going to decrease around here 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.159
 I think that in four polite 2 the world 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.860
 be there are the figures 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.740
 therefore how many figures we would have happy 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.830
 list would have a 2 3 4 5 6 percent 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.539
 what we had seen how its previous version 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.080
 snell and do this there are many people 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.889
 how many children do you have to name 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.389
 list who seven figures 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.680
 your world csif rae 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.599
 in 2004 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.759
 together with place 3 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.909
 and his mother the younger yes 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:59.919
 Not that much 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.379
 I would have 7 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.979
 figures
