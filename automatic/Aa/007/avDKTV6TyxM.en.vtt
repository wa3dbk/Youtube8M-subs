00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.560
 f1 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.990
 The clerk is not losing to the exchange meeting 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.430
 Let me see 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.370
 The minimum level after that is great 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.300
 The wintering ground is Swiss, so it's a treasure trove of history that we'll celebrate again this week 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 I'm out and I think everyone noticed 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.300
 The fact of sale 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.550
 Fukukawa will do twice 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.880
 In addition to the flow of the river, it is the Japanese army because it changes monthly 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.620
 I have not made that series 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.730
 If it keeps going 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.320
 68 years old 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.790
 Please check that content 8 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.900
 In many sessions replaced with blues chorusing 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.010
 Done before 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.719
 Of course some money or something in the drawer of 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.530
 It is not the reason why in the first place the rhythm is bad 

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:29.039
 I think too important but too important 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.320
 I think 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.680
 -5-4-13- 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.240
 Let's copy the race 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.130
 Got the rhythm 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 That schedule 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.800
 In the center of Mita Tanaka 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 I think that rigging is easy to understand 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 Such atmosphere is good when I have it g. 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.600
 The idea of ​​fedexcup 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 For the time being, the slowdown has been high 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 Already 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.120
 This kind of activity and once but today to major 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.899
 Start from 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.819
 It's difficult that the suspect is 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.820
 The fact that the public offering high swing is made actually starts but it is very important 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.079
 One way 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 done byat 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.239
 The third is voiced before the brotheryas statement 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.089
 Cheer for small turns course 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 Goto Atsumi 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.979
 Soul jazz sought canned 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 The remaining seven 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.570
 Put major 3 putts to think that it is the difference 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.339
 In fact, we see state of Kawakami in part 2 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 Man's parting woman's part 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.559
 I do not go through Hercules's Ganjo mode 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.559
 reuters from it 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.579
 Roses and Gardening Show 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.579
 Where there is a race 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.740
 I think it is different 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.959
 With that in mind that everyone is easy to understand 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.109
 I would like to associate 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.809
 Clemens same number 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.809
 Cute lol 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.890
 AIDS Orphans at the Summit 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.120
 As it continues, it seems g1 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059
 Because 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.469
 We controlled by 2-1 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.590
 Of course 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.590
 2301g class 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.039
 Ossu 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.279
 Cheap 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.249
 2008- 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.430
 On the same month 56 days 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.430
 The ruling party will blink 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.300
 It is a difficult race 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.150
 Let's look hard in the US and China on the yen bond. 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.999
 Transition 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.589
 That's right. 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:48.629
 Bright 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.629
 I have been in the seventh year 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.439
 These are all 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.039
 kbs Kyoto 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.650
 I wonder if it gives me the number of cores 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.119
 I was using it to hold it 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.979
 It is continuing 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.089
 That baht content is one more 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.879
 Wintering 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.759
 I'm not worried about the previous version but things related to solar cells 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.409
 It was difficult to be full of things 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.490
 I want to make it sound, please add body fat again 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.370
 In fact
