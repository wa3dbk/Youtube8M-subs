00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.119
 so welcome to the press conference after 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.520
 end of kv kortrijk club brugge 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:18.939
 naturally we start with the visitor 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.350
 a super stupid yes fall the first 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.630
 half the game that actually really 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.890
 come in all directions but in the second 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 half 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 slightly too little portion of what i club 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.470
 that well together 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 yes look we do what we can and what 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.090
 the opponent also allows 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.359
 I think we have the problems with 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.649
 football is the short-term point that is 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.969
 not the first time 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.210
 because also happened full year that is 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.649
 been one of our problem today and 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.780
 The second problem is that we have ours 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.600
 opportunities that have finished when you see 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.389
 in a quick were very very big chances 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.269
 at a few meters from the goal that you nie 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:06.460
 nie scored in the second half was pino 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.409
 as you say ok you might be one 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.299
 little in the precipitation you do here 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.979
 not the right move at the right 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:23.200
 moment and declare, I think our 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:25.810
 cousin but you are now disappointed behind 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.240
 such a huge long series of almost 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.869
 Be invincible if you play a game 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 you must be able to get on well 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.729
 lose and pretty can win 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.320
 I think we started as much as we did 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.079
 you ever you should be able to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.469
 accept and see what the omissions 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.469
 walked 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.539
 but then you take it a bit 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.920
 have done 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.890
 maybe then make an impression for it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.719
 everyone but I still find European 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 cup from belgium 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:08.039
 an option in the final and yet always 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.940
 first in the championship for my 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.940
 pants performance 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.690
 if I had one of the two games 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.129
 oliesel kortrijk would rather those today than 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170
 in the cup 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.310
 because we play on a hemisphere 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.310
 to do it as well as possible 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 I'm going to move the microphones with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.790
 the other way 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.590
 yes I had it a few times 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.209
 I announced in the newspaper this week 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.549
 have a plan ready to club Brugge 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.829
 defeat 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.640
 May I then conclude that it is 100% there 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.989
 implemented that plan and watch curry 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.670
 maybe I have something 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.200
 straighten out what this week in the newspaper 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.940
 has appeared and indeed has passed 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 a certain journalist and it is here 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.819
 for my franc a little oil on it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.530
 fire big 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.450
 I also have no more francs there 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.280
 I just want to pay respect 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.799
 to all the achievements that you already have 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.079
 has been put on the field this year and as 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.819
 today we have ordinary that was 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.260
 Even again Kantje Board can also be one 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.389
 be a different result 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.680
 but my players fought for it and 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.720
 maybe that's the game than michel 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.850
 not so keen to see where the adolescents and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 maybe less for light and it is 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.799
 our earnings for every meter 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 there fighting and we are really three 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.370
 bonus points and for that I hope 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.560
 that anyone who's even club bridge 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
 has to do I know completely 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160
 nothing against it and that you really do 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.959
 appreciate what they put on the mat 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.519
 only full of michel 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.040
 if I win a strong bridge with 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:43.250
 vvv there is indeed a very good result 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.079
 but that team was not what we are 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.669
 I think with all due respect 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.250
 cercle but the stupid thing there too 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.829
 a lot of young talent on the field for the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.200
 I really appreciate your work and me 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.840
 appreciate everything that you do 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.130
 weigh bridges for our competition 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
 just think that it really fights for it 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.520
 and I had hoped 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.380
 on a lead and we really had that 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.380
 necessary and that has already been the case 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.360
 all the competition out was necessary and 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.190
 therefore eric is the conviction at mine 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.350
 player experience 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.510
 to go for that for the result 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.700
 keep fighting and you know like 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.350
 you will get a score a goal against then 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.140
 is there already one or another that you times something 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.300
 had less effort then what that 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.830
 I think my players are concerned 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.990
 have done very well 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 and then we had to wait for the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.080
 last minute 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 to finally finally give up 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.650
 to take 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.490
 but the result can also be different 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.490
 have been normal
