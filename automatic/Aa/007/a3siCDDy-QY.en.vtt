00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 so to say goodbye to my closet that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.460
 leave this week because I'm going 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.420
 remake this whole room I'll do 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 a tag that calls to my fashion speech 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 clothes etc and such and I'm going to record here 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 for the last time it will not be much better 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
 Sickle legal and I'll show you 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.470
 is the first question is which kind of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 clothes you would never wear 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.510
 I find it difficult to talk things that people 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.720
 I would never dare because normally people 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.769
 fold tongue then I do not know if they are 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.160
 this way too 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.410
 but I think very low-cut clothes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 very out of belly 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.050
 belly out not cause lack the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 Belly for this and I do not even want to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.120
 I try because then I do not think 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.949
 would wear the clothes that leave the belly of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 out 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.250
 What kind of clothes do you love to wear ? 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 I love to wear feminine clothes and love to wear 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 round skirt 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.659
 I love to use my leg off, actually I 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 I really like short queens and already 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.220
 must have noticed this on the blog but the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 reason of the favorite one who so 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.869
 that I'll take when I do not have 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 many ideas that I will use are well 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 always ends a sainha a dress one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.409
 not even cuddly things that are with you - 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.409
 like or dislike 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.840
 I do not really like prints that are 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 very big know how to make a mega flower 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.670
 which is repeated 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.040
 I like both the smaller ones and what I 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.930
 I'm noticing more discrete colors 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 so I'm not very colorful is the 10 or so 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.000
 netbook today's duty but it's ours 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.619
 I'm super the opposite of what I am 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.420
 talking right? 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.979
 was as well as several the prints now I 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.020
 I'm talking to think maybe print 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.379
 great not but you only used it for being a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.900
 present or have worn a suit just for having 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.180
 gain 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.549
 the tense nor answering people is the kind of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 something that we can not hide anymore 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.760
 There's something I just because I won. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.799
 so especially when it is a person 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 dear we do not want to leave 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.879
 annoying person and such and even uses but I 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.470
 I do not recall a specific piece but I 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.569
 I already did it for sure so I'm 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.069
 when you see that the person thought much 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.510
 in you when you buy something else 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.500
 she has not hit 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.680
 she told me then she ends up using it is beautiful 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.349
 so no, but I do not know if you do not 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 had nothing that gave me but I do not know only 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:01.889
 for obligation not being I thought that I 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:05.359
 I wanted to show you on twitter and I would take 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.540
 that fall is bored for me 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.280
 I will not fall, my body will not work. 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.980
 I do not give to myself I have a body that 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.139
 It's too wide here or on the shoulder and I 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.730
 I have a fatter arm in my leg. 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.650
 so I do not say I'll take it because 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.690
 It is well quoting the type of body the people 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.370
 have to use what values ​​people and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.079
 I hope you fall, you do not value well 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.599
 none so I guess it does not have 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.620
 No one will fall again. 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.209
 dress is difficult i like one 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.099
 very practical thing at a very 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.829
 fun now because it's easy, not just 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.479
 Boot one thing is ready but it is one 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.819
 only subject I liked also speaks 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:49.229
 good women's clothing business 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.609
 little girl and I like both now I think 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.379
 so if I have to choose between 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.569
 buy a hostile purchase purchase sai 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.489
 leaves because I 'm going to end up using more 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.109
 get out of that dress that we can 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.479
 combine with more things not invested in 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.169
 Famous people, there is no way for him alone. 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:08.209
 I think I 'm going to leave what people say 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:12.540
 It's ugly, it's just you think it's beautiful. 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.310
 so I like to shoe that it is so at 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.750
 times like very different shoes I 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.760
 I remember a boot that I used once 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.709
 on the blog that everyone from gold to boot 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.709
 she fascinava soro in the language 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.419
 Hey, I even did something I should not 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.550
 but I was somewhat traumatized by the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.370
 comments and even a time in the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.650
 poor thing Boot but I loved it 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.960
 improved means to be well known was not 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.699
 nothing delicate and then everyone said that 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.050
 It was ugly but I liked it. 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.729
 I have a shoe that I'm a little 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.650
 so I like a shoe more 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.449
 rude just to 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.759
 contrast with my clothes that I 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.889
 talk that more boys are girls and such 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.990
 but people will not like them 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:57.870
 They prefer that I use everything well, little girl. 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:02.430
 sometimes it happens what would be a 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.289
 ordinary clothes and I think I 'll judge it 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.190
 a garment that does not respect who is in 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.960
 return 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.000
 for example you can wear a dress 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.949
 short on the beach 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020
 It will look good, everyone will look great. 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.210
 will think that it is being a place but 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.810
 You wear that same dress. 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.180
 I do not know about a wedding but it's very common. 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.939
 because you have to respect the 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.349
 environment without respecting occasion 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.729
 You do not respect who you are. 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.009
 come back I think 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.440
 so I guess the place is not to lend 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.259
 attention to where you are going at 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.569
 any region you are you going 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.770
 over here because you're wearing the 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.210
 same clothing can have connotations 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.759
 completely different depending on the 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.909
 environment, what are you doing in the four colors? 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:51.089
 What else do you have in your wardrobe? 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:54.690
 hum I think white is a lot of thing 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:57.990
 white here black 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.610
 but this counts as coconut is basic but 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.009
 finally black white 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.560
 I really like the color is more closed. 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.750
 purple wine type and such then I have 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.219
 several pieces so half purple and pink 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:19.409
 dark and such 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:21.330
 and I think blue blue and what color or 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:25.440
 colors that you do not have and will not have 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.240
 No way in your wardrobe is the one 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.810
 time ago I would say it was red 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.819
 because I think it 's a color that's very 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.710
 strong and I talked and cared a lot about 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.720
 my skin 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.970
 I was very well before but I'm in love. 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.340
 red now has a lot of thing 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.260
 red has a blazer has invested in 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:48.110
 end of career and that he now I think 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:50.330
 cool but I have nothing yellow I think 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.400
 at least from above and co 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.440
 I think it influences me a lot. 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.980
 she is near your face 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.260
 Why did you leave before you do so I do not see 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.260
 much difference pants shorts skirts and such 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.550
 do not have a color that you hate and that's why 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.660
 will never enter europe so 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.700
 Now I think this has to pay. 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.280
 attention to what works 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.170
 well with our colors and how it 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.430
 works best with darker color for 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.080
 give a contrast 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.530
 I think it got very vibrant a lot 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:23.540
 stop at the top I did not use then 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:25.400
 I know yellow is orange depending on the 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.490
 Tom can give you one more year to use. 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.400
 open I will not use the lemon-green stays 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.470
 too weird henin colors too 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.450
 very bright I think not 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.150
 works for me so I hardly 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:41.330
 I'm going to train more and that's what we are 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.280
 advanced video of my bachelor video 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.040
 the zetti as he is today after me 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.900
 I'll come back to show you how he stayed and who 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.850
 Do not forget to leave the joinha down for 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.260

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:55.750
 who is enrolled watch the videos 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.750
 first a kiss and see you soon 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.780
 and I hope you enjoyed that leaves 

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.860
 here under the fingernail for me too 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.860
 said not me
