00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
hour or two after you've applied our

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
hour or two after you've applied our
oils<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.140> sure<00:01:16.289> that<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.800> there<00:01:16.979> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
oils to make sure that if there is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
oils to make sure that if there is
additional<00:01:17.220> sweating<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.179> wipe<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.450> off

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
additional sweating you can wipe it off

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
additional sweating you can wipe it off
so<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> doesn't<00:01:19.170> leave<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.649> film<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.160> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so it doesn't leave that film of that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
so it doesn't leave that film of that
crust<00:01:20.910> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.179> surface<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> you'd<00:01:21.929> have<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
crust on the surface that you'd have to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
crust on the surface that you'd have to
dilute<00:01:22.619> after<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.789> we<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.179> in<00:01:30.450> different

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
dilute after so we have in different

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
dilute after so we have in different
formats<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> tung<00:01:31.560> oil<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.039> then<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.759> also

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
formats the tung oil and then we also

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.109 
formats the tung oil and then we also
have<00:01:33.270> al<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> situ<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:35.070> linseed<00:01:35.640> oil<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.090> a

have al in situ it our linseed oil is a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.710 
have al in situ it our linseed oil is a
double<00:01:36.539> boiled<00:01:37.050> pale<00:01:37.979> linseed<00:01:38.759> oil<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.690> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
double boiled pale linseed oil when I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.999 
double boiled pale linseed oil when I
I'm<00:01:40.409> trying<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.330> iterate<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.720> pale<00:01:43.500> linseed

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I'm trying to iterate the pale linseed

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710 
I'm trying to iterate the pale linseed
oil<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:44.970> Lindsay<00:01:45.420> Doyle's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
oil because a lot of Lindsay Doyle's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.319 
oil because a lot of Lindsay Doyle's
actually<00:01:46.049> use<00:01:46.340> darker<00:01:47.340> grains<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
actually use darker grains and this is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
actually use darker grains and this is
what<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.600> give<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> darker<00:01:49.200> color<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.680> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
what will give a darker color to your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.280 
what will give a darker color to your
would<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.820> linseed<00:01:51.210> oil<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.720> carry

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
would the linseed oil that we carry

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
would the linseed oil that we carry
actually<00:01:53.189> does<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.939> no<00:01:54.450> double

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
actually does not do that no double

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
actually does not do that no double
boiled<00:01:55.140> means<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.729> been<00:01:56.820> dryers

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
boiled means that there have been dryers

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
boiled means that there have been dryers
that<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.630> had<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> been<00:01:58.079> added<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that have had it been added to it so I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.929 
that have had it been added to it so I
suggest<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.850> using<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.750> any<00:02:01.020> food<00:02:01.590> safe

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
suggest not using it for any food safe

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
suggest not using it for any food safe
areas

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860

it 100% crystallized in the wood but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.270 
it 100% crystallized in the wood but
that's<00:02:33.340> why<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.879> food<00:02:34.209> safe<00:02:34.890> linseed<00:02:35.890> oil<00:02:35.980> I

want<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.919> keep<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.280> oak<00:04:19.260> basically<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
want to keep the oak basically that the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.290 
want to keep the oak basically that the
surface<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.370> want<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.639> keep<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.910> then<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
surface you want to keep it then the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.969 
surface you want to keep it then the
nice<00:04:22.450> red<00:04:22.780> or<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.020> nice<00:04:23.229> white<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.860> is

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
nice red or the nice white that it is

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.440 
nice red or the nice white that it is
but<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.340> want<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.550> fill<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.910> grain<00:04:25.090> with<00:04:25.419> a

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
but you want to fill the grain with a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.870 
but you want to fill the grain with a
bit<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.720> an<00:04:25.870> antiquing<00:04:26.410> look<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:27.220> can<00:04:27.400> add<00:04:27.610> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
bit of an antiquing look you can add the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.540 
bit of an antiquing look you can add the
bitumen<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.330> Judea<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.780> an<00:04:29.320> oil<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.889> then

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
bitumen of Judea to an oil and then

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.240 
bitumen of Judea to an oil and then
basically<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:31.389> rub<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.350> on<00:04:32.470> rub<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.950> in<00:04:33.100> the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
basically just rub it on rub it in the

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.159 
basically just rub it on rub it in the
grain<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.639> circular<00:04:34.060> motion<00:04:34.419> and<00:04:34.630> then<00:04:34.930> you

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
grain and circular motion and then you

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.350 
grain and circular motion and then you
want<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.380> scrape<00:04:35.680> off<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:35.950> excess<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:37.210> what

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
want to scrape off the excess so what

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.909 
want to scrape off the excess so what
it's<00:04:37.479> doing<00:04:37.840> it's<00:04:37.990> basically<00:04:38.380> filling<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
it's doing it's basically filling the

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.830 
it's doing it's basically filling the
grain<00:04:39.160> with<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.370> little<00:04:39.669> bit<00:04:39.789> of<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.660> an

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
grain with a little bit of a of an

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.230 
grain with a little bit of a of an
antiquing<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.440> guess<00:04:41.950> look<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.580> it

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
antiquing I guess look to it

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.510 
antiquing I guess look to it
now<00:04:43.630> it's<00:04:43.780> also<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.289> adheres<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.830> stone<00:04:45.190> to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
now it's also it adheres to stone to

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670 
now it's also it adheres to stone to
wood<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.090> metal<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.050> can<00:04:47.289> use<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.620> on

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
wood and metal so you can use it on

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.850 
wood and metal so you can use it on
slate<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.520> use<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.850> on<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.720> lot<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.590> people

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
slate you can use it on a lot of people

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.890 
slate you can use it on a lot of people
are<00:04:50.950> using<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.400> antique<00:04:52.060> hardware<00:04:52.330> which

are using it to antique hardware which

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.379 
are using it to antique hardware which
you<00:04:53.349> have<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.530> beautiful<00:04:53.979> brass<00:04:54.250> finish<00:04:55.030> and

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
you have a beautiful brass finish and

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.879 
you have a beautiful brass finish and
you<00:04:55.450> want<00:04:55.630> to<00:04:55.690> make<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.960> look<00:04:56.050> antique<00:04:56.500> to

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
you want to make it look antique to

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.909 
you want to make it look antique to
change<00:04:57.520> or<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.970> restore<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.990> nice<00:04:59.620> piece<00:04:59.889> of

change or to restore a nice piece of

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.800 
change or to restore a nice piece of
furniture<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.940> would<00:05:01.210> definitely<00:05:01.360> be<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
furniture this would definitely be a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.560 
furniture this would definitely be a
perfect<00:05:02.289> product<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.770> use

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.050 

we<00:05:07.170> have<00:05:07.410> our<00:05:07.710> citrus<00:05:08.490> thinner<00:05:08.730> which

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
we have our citrus thinner which

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.240 
we have our citrus thinner which
basically<00:05:09.450> is<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.720> dilemma<00:05:10.170> 9<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.920> a<00:05:11.040> pure

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
basically is a dilemma 9 and it's a pure

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.730 
basically is a dilemma 9 and it's a pure
extract<00:05:11.760> from<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.120> rind<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.630> an<00:05:13.050> orange<00:05:13.470> so<00:05:13.710> it

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
extract from the rind of an orange so it

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.410 
extract from the rind of an orange so it
basically<00:05:13.920> smells<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.700> if<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.970> could<00:05:15.150> drink

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
basically smells as if you could drink

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.300 
basically smells as if you could drink

its comes in several formats and it is
fantastic<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.440> use<00:05:22.940> other<00:05:23.940> than<00:05:24.060> that<00:05:24.300> we<00:05:24.420> also

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
fantastic to use other than that we also

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.270 
fantastic to use other than that we also
have<00:05:24.960> an<00:05:25.200> odorless<00:05:25.710> thinner<00:05:25.950> now<00:05:26.220> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
have an odorless thinner now the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.400 
have an odorless thinner now the
odorless<00:05:26.850> thinner<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.300> exactly<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.260> a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
odorless thinner is exactly that it's a

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.170 
odorless thinner is exactly that it's a
hundred<00:05:28.650> percent<00:05:28.740> highly<00:05:29.490> refined<00:05:29.820> ISO

hundred percent highly refined ISO

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.080 
hundred percent highly refined ISO
paraffin<00:05:30.840> it's<00:05:31.440> what<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:31.920> find<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.490> our<00:05:32.610> uno

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
paraffin it's what we find in our uno

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.410 
paraffin it's what we find in our uno
Segundo<00:05:33.780> perreo<00:05:34.290> and<00:05:34.590> briault<00:05:34.830> lines<00:05:35.300> so<00:05:36.300> if

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
Segundo perreo and briault lines so if

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.940 
Segundo perreo and briault lines so if
you<00:05:36.540> need<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.750> thin<00:05:36.960> those<00:05:37.200> down<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.650> spray

you need to thin those down to spray

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.040 
you need to thin those down to spray
them<00:05:38.160> then<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.790> highly<00:05:39.090> suggest<00:05:39.270> using<00:05:39.750> this

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
them then I highly suggest using this

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.470 
them then I highly suggest using this
when<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.830> say<00:05:41.070> it's<00:05:41.220> ownerless<00:05:41.760> I<00:05:41.910> mean<00:05:42.090> exactly

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
when I say it's ownerless I mean exactly

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.320 
when I say it's ownerless I mean exactly
that<00:05:42.570> has<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.380> very<00:05:43.800> very<00:05:43.890> faint<00:05:44.490> odor<00:05:44.790> at<00:05:45.030> that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
that has a very very faint odor at that

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.010 
that has a very very faint odor at that
if<00:05:45.510> any<00:05:45.750> so<00:05:46.500> it's<00:05:46.680> easy<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:47.220> can<00:05:47.370> use<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:47.700> in

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
if any so it's easy you can use it in

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.380 
if any so it's easy you can use it in
areas<00:05:49.020> or<00:05:49.410> if<00:05:49.530> you're<00:05:49.740> very<00:05:50.060> susceptible<00:05:51.060> to

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
areas or if you're very susceptible to

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.120 
areas or if you're very susceptible to
smells<00:05:51.990> then<00:05:52.230> this<00:05:52.350> would<00:05:52.530> be<00:05:52.650> a<00:05:52.680> perfect

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
smells then this would be a perfect

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.730 
smells then this would be a perfect
thinner<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:54.060> use<00:05:54.270> if<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:55.320> want<00:05:55.500> something

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
thinner to use if you want something

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.980 
thinner to use if you want something
that<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.760> little<00:05:57.150> bit<00:05:57.360> more<00:05:57.510> aggressive

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
that is a little bit more aggressive

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.200 
that is a little bit more aggressive
like<00:05:58.170> this<00:05:58.530> citrus<00:05:58.800> thinner<00:05:59.160> but<00:06:00.000> has<00:06:00.180> a

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
like this citrus thinner but has a

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.940 
like this citrus thinner but has a
little<00:06:00.510> bit<00:06:00.630> less<00:06:00.780> of<00:06:00.900> this<00:06:01.080> smell<00:06:01.320> then<00:06:01.770> we

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
little bit less of this smell then we
