aint fuckin host just join the server so
first<00:00:37.140> things<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.710> have

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
first things first we have

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.500 
first things first we have
physically-based<00:00:38.430> shaders<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
physically-based shaders which is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.880 
physically-based shaders which is
awesome<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
awesome if you don't know what that is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.400 
awesome if you don't know what that is
you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.700> google<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:42.960> makes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you can go google it but it just makes

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.549 
you can go google it but it just makes
everything<00:00:43.590> look<00:00:44.100> awesome<00:00:45.260> next<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.500> a

everything look awesome next we have a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
everything look awesome next we have a
new<00:00:46.829> map<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> Russian<00:00:48.600> base

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
new map right this is the Russian base

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
new map right this is the Russian base
in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.410> bottom<00:00:49.590> left<00:00:50.039> corner<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.579> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
in the bottom left corner and then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.069 
in the bottom left corner and then
there's<00:00:50.850> American<00:00:51.329> base<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.690> top<00:00:51.899> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there's American base at the top right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.510 
there's American base at the top right
corner<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> city<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
corner and then there's a city in the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
corner and then there's a city in the
middle<00:00:53.670> there's<00:00:54.329> objective<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.289> can

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
middle there's objective that you can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
middle there's objective that you can
capture<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> new<00:00:56.730> points<00:00:57.420> system

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
capture and there is a new points system

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
capture and there is a new points system
so<00:00:58.109> here's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.649> sense<00:00:58.949> pre-battle<00:00:59.370> right<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so here's a sense pre-battle right and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
so here's a sense pre-battle right and
then<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.780> spun<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> spot<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
then if we spun at can you spot at the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.719 
then if we spun at can you spot at the
Russian<00:01:03.030> Bay<00:01:03.149> station<00:01:03.359> oh<00:01:03.719> yeah<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.610> as

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
Russian Bay station oh yeah right so as

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.030 
Russian Bay station oh yeah right so as
you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.500> doesn't<00:01:07.860> matter

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you can see because it doesn't matter

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
you can see because it doesn't matter
which<00:01:08.220> gun<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> kill<00:01:09.840> me

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
which gun you just need to be to kill me

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
which gun you just need to be to kill me
alright<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> vehicles<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> every<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
alright so the vehicles and every this

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
alright so the vehicles and every this
network<00:01:12.150> has<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.450> smooth<00:01:12.840> quite<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
network has been smooth quite a lot so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
network has been smooth quite a lot so
um<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:16.619> won't<00:01:16.890> lag<00:01:17.159> anymore<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.000> bullet

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
um it won't lag anymore and bullet

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
um it won't lag anymore and bullet
registration<00:01:19.470> bullets<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.549> been<00:01:20.729> redone

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
registration bullets have been redone

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.039 
registration bullets have been redone
before<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.670> normal<00:01:24.360> rigid

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
before it was just you know normal rigid

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.679 
before it was just you know normal rigid
body<00:01:25.200> bullets<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.040> rigid<00:01:26.850> body<00:01:27.180> flying

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
body bullets now it's rigid body flying

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
body bullets now it's rigid body flying
forward<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.829> raycast<00:01:29.220> detection

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
forward but also using raycast detection

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
forward but also using raycast detection
so<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.240> follows<00:01:30.540> physics<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.490> registers

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so it follows physics and it registers

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
so it follows physics and it registers
perfectly<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.170> name<00:01:34.950> tags

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
perfectly as you can see the name tags

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
perfectly as you can see the name tags
are<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.880> green<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.630> teammate<00:01:37.500> name

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
are now green when it's teammate name

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.640 
are now green when it's teammate name
tags<00:01:38.220> no<00:01:38.430> longer<00:01:38.700> clip<00:01:38.939> through<00:01:39.150> walls<00:01:39.650> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
tags no longer clip through walls the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
tags no longer clip through walls the
your<00:01:41.280> teammate<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> Russian<00:01:42.270> team<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
your teammate the Russian team has a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.999 
your teammate the Russian team has a
different<00:01:43.020> player<00:01:43.200> texture<00:01:43.649> than<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
different player texture than the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.830 
different player texture than the
American<00:01:44.520> team<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:45.899> kill<00:01:46.409> me

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
American team so if you can just kill me

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.899

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
tank yeah so I yeah since the map is so

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.170 
tank yeah so I yeah since the map is so
big<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.889> know<00:05:10.039> we're<00:05:10.580> gonna<00:05:10.699> be<00:05:10.910> pretty

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
big you know we're gonna be pretty

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.909 
big you know we're gonna be pretty
scattered<00:05:11.720> around<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.139> map<00:05:12.380> that's<00:05:12.590> why<00:05:12.770> we

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
scattered around the map that's why we

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.650 
scattered around the map that's why we
have<00:05:13.039> like<00:05:13.220> 10<00:05:13.490> people<00:05:13.820> in<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.000> test<00:05:14.270> or<00:05:14.479> group

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
have like 10 people in the test or group

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.490 
have like 10 people in the test or group
but<00:05:14.870> since<00:05:15.530> no<00:05:15.590> one<00:05:15.889> is<00:05:16.010> online<00:05:16.190> it's<00:05:16.639> just<00:05:16.789> us

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
but since no one is online it's just us

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.960 
but since no one is online it's just us
yeah<00:05:20.320> but<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.860> vehicle<00:05:22.220> response<00:05:22.669> square

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
yeah but the vehicle response square

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.879 
yeah but the vehicle response square
should<00:05:23.150> work<00:05:25.870> so<00:05:26.870> as<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.349> see<00:05:27.590> several

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
should work so as you can see several

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.820 
should work so as you can see several
bugs<00:05:28.220> concerning<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.910> network<00:05:29.360> are<00:05:29.830> present

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
bugs concerning the network are present

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.850 
bugs concerning the network are present
in<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.130> match<00:05:31.990> they<00:05:32.990> are<00:05:33.050> very<00:05:33.110> fixed<00:05:33.620> about

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
in the match they are very fixed about

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.800 
in the match they are very fixed about
fixable<00:05:34.460> bugs<00:05:34.789> though<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.419> there<00:05:35.690> will<00:05:35.780> be

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
fixable bugs though so there will be

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.540 
fixable bugs though so there will be
fixed<00:05:36.080> very<00:05:36.320> soon<00:05:36.620> it's<00:05:36.919> just<00:05:37.159> that<00:05:37.310> the

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
fixed very soon it's just that the

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.719 
fixed very soon it's just that the
current<00:05:37.760> vehicle<00:05:38.419> scripts<00:05:38.659> are<00:05:38.840> not<00:05:39.020> very

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
current vehicle scripts are not very

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.240 
current vehicle scripts are not very
optimized<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:41.030> use<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:42.560> off<00:05:42.830> for<00:05:43.159> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
optimized to use to off for the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.110 
optimized to use to off for the
networking<00:05:43.610> system<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:45.680> i<00:05:46.099> might<00:05:46.490> have<00:05:46.940> to

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
networking system so i might have to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.839 
networking system so i might have to
rewrite<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.780> vehicle<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:49.190> entire<00:05:49.490> vehicle

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
rewrite the vehicle the entire vehicle

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.909 
rewrite the vehicle the entire vehicle
network<00:05:50.570> updating<00:05:50.930> scripts<00:05:51.199> but<00:05:51.409> it<00:05:51.740> will<00:05:51.889> be

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
network updating scripts but it will be

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.820 
network updating scripts but it will be
done<00:05:52.130> um<00:05:52.900> several<00:05:53.900> things<00:05:54.050> have<00:05:54.199> not<00:05:54.380> shown<00:05:54.650> in

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
done um several things have not shown in

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
the videos that if you run out of points

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.779

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
if your team riot points there will be

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.490 
if your team riot points there will be
an<00:05:58.970> end<00:05:59.120> game<00:05:59.330> screen<00:05:59.659> that<00:05:59.810> says<00:05:59.960> victory<00:06:00.349> or
