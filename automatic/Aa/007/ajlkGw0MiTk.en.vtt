you
invest<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:16.250> domain<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.519> your<00:04:17.760> time<00:04:17.940> which

invest in the domain of your time which
i<00:04:18.209> think<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.510> most<00:04:18.750> important<00:04:19.970> objective

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970

of formative education children cheaply

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.090 
of formative education children cheaply
because<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.540> value<00:04:24.990> creates<00:04:25.650> one<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
because the value creates one and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100 
because the value creates one and
evaluated<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.510> that's<00:04:28.020> something
