Mini Cooper so therefore no nitrous is
allowed<00:00:57.329> during<00:00:57.719> testing<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:59.390> car<00:01:00.390> level

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
allowed during testing also car level

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
allowed during testing also car level
has<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.960> 320<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> basic<00:01:02.579> car<00:01:02.910> level

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
has to be 320 that's the basic car level

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
has to be 320 that's the basic car level
which<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.170> street<00:01:04.530> spec<00:01:04.799> car<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
which you get your street spec car I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
which you get your street spec car I
could<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:07.350> two<00:01:07.530> nine<00:01:07.740> nine<00:01:07.770> car<00:01:08.340> level<00:01:08.640> bar

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
could do one two nine nine car level bar

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
could do one two nine nine car level bar
that<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.299> take<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> long

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that would just take like really a long

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
that would just take like really a long
time<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> grind<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.720> every

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
time to grind in you know get every

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
time to grind in you know get every
single<00:01:12.960> car<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.740> point<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.030> their

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
single car up to that point so their

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
single car up to that point so their
forms<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> basic<00:01:16.530> car

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
forms you can do with the basic car

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.249 
forms you can do with the basic car
level<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> event<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> chose<00:01:19.049> the

English the initiation that's because

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
English the initiation that's because
the<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.390> event<00:01:24.390> offers<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:26.189> lowest<00:01:26.460> amount

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the the event offers the lowest amount

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.800 
the the event offers the lowest amount
of<00:01:27.479> traffic<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.500> available<00:01:29.270> from<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.600> the
