but<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> hits<00:02:35.200> hard<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.770> has<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> stellar

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
but it hits hard and has a stellar

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.770 
but it hits hard and has a stellar
finish<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:38.500> secret<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.220> simple<00:02:39.730> flip<00:02:40.600> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
finish the secret is simple flip the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.840 
finish the secret is simple flip the
deck<00:02:40.959> over<00:02:41.380> don't<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:42.040> any<00:02:42.220> other<00:02:42.430> reverse

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850

you<00:02:47.140> want<00:02:47.400> dai<00:02:48.400> vernon<00:02:48.430> made<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.180> King's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you want dai vernon made the King's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.830 
you want dai vernon made the King's
famous<00:02:50.490> then<00:02:51.490> flip<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.970> packet<00:02:52.450> over<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
famous then flip the packet over and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.460 
famous then flip the packet over and
here's<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.200> situation<00:02:53.350> check<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.200> cards

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
here's the situation check all the cards

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.530 
here's the situation check all the cards
are<00:02:56.590> normal<00:02:56.980> here<00:02:57.190> until<00:02:57.580> last<00:02:57.970> four<00:02:58.300> which

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
are normal here until last four which

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
are normal here until last four which
are<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.780> four<00:02:58.989> kings<00:02:59.320> reversed<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.640> deck

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
are the four kings reversed in the deck

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.030 
are the four kings reversed in the deck
then<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.739> go<00:03:02.950> into<00:03:03.220> some<00:03:03.400> patter<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.709> know<00:03:05.830> I

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
if you're having any trouble with them

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.580 
if you're having any trouble with them
and<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:27.070> flip<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.580> deck<00:03:27.730> over<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.590> now

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and you flip the deck over like this now

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.740 
and you flip the deck over like this now
what<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.830> just<00:03:30.070> did<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.700> took<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:31.269> packet

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
what I just did was I took this packet

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.490 
what I just did was I took this packet
here<00:03:32.080> which<00:03:32.769> has<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> reversed<00:03:33.519> Kings<00:03:33.940> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
here which has the reversed Kings and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.560 
here which has the reversed Kings and
flipped<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.650> over<00:03:35.769> with<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.280> other<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:36.820> so

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
flipped it over with this other one so

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.600 
flipped it over with this other one so
now<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.140> what<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.709> you're<00:03:39.400> going

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
now this is what you have you're going

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.699 
now this is what you have you're going
to<00:03:39.670> be<00:03:39.760> shuffling<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> cards<00:03:40.989> except<00:03:41.410> for

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
to be shuffling all the cards except for

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.800 
to be shuffling all the cards except for
these<00:03:42.610> which<00:03:42.910> are<00:03:43.030> going<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> be<00:03:43.330> reversed<00:03:45.810> but

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
these which are going to be reversed but

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.580 
these which are going to be reversed but
you<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.769> careful<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.670> flash

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
you have to be careful not to flash

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.520 
you have to be careful not to flash
these<00:03:50.850> while<00:03:51.850> you're<00:03:52.060> rippling<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:53.019> keep<00:03:53.350> it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
these while you're rippling so keep it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.509 
these while you're rippling so keep it
tight<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.370> close<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.390> table<00:03:56.190> riffle<00:03:57.190> them

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
tight and close to the table riffle them

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.270 
tight and close to the table riffle them
but<00:03:57.730> make<00:03:57.940> sure<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.269> have<00:03:58.769> one<00:03:59.769> of<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.010> kings

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
but make sure to have one of the kings

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.750 
but make sure to have one of the kings
on<00:04:00.519> top<00:04:01.350> then<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.380> can<00:04:02.680> go<00:04:02.799> into<00:04:02.920> normal<00:04:03.370> table

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
on top then you can go into normal table

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.500 
on top then you can go into normal table
riffles<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.560> know<00:04:05.709> cut<00:04:06.100> some<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.910> even

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
riffles and you know cut some I even

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.390 
riffles and you know cut some I even
like<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.690> scramble<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> cards<00:04:08.650> really<00:04:08.920> fast

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
like to scramble the cards really fast

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.559 
like to scramble the cards really fast
but<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.180> got<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> put<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.750> back<00:04:10.780> up

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
but you got to put it back up

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.759 
but you got to put it back up
I<00:04:11.599> don't<00:04:12.560> notice<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.879> you<00:04:13.939> give<00:04:14.180> them<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.769> quick
