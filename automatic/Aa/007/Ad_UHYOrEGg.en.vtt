we'll<00:03:13.660> take<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> look<00:03:14.110> at<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> stuff

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
we'll take a look at some of the stuff

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.460 
we'll take a look at some of the stuff
that<00:03:15.070> I've<00:03:15.190> been<00:03:15.280> working<00:03:15.610> on<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.260> finished

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
that I've been working on so I finished

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.040 
that I've been working on so I finished
my<00:03:18.220> weakness<00:03:18.640> away<00:03:18.880> box<00:03:19.180> carrots<00:03:19.630> all<00:03:19.780> done

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
my weakness away box carrots all done

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.630 
my weakness away box carrots all done
now<00:03:20.260> weathered<00:03:20.710> up<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.130> clear<00:03:22.060> coated<00:03:23.640> so

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
now weathered up and clear coated so

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.010 
now weathered up and clear coated so
we'll<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:24.850> show<00:03:25.030> some<00:03:25.060> different<00:03:25.450> angles<00:03:25.930> of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
we'll just show some different angles of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:35.160 
we'll just show some different angles of
it<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> end<00:03:33.840> similar<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.020> the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it this is the a end similar to the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.900 
it this is the a end similar to the
other<00:03:35.950> side<00:03:36.160> they've<00:03:36.310> got<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.430> door<00:03:36.670> at<00:03:36.760> both

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
other side they've got a door at both

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.440 
other side they've got a door at both
ends<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.480> other<00:03:40.810> side<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:46.120> thing<00:03:46.300> that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
ends and the other side one thing that

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.800 
ends and the other side one thing that
worked<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:47.200> well<00:03:47.320> was<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.520> did<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> same

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
worked really well was I did the same

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.510 
worked really well was I did the same
method<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.290> always<00:03:50.470> do<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:50.830> Windows<00:03:51.250> I

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
method I always do to make Windows I

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.240 
method I always do to make Windows I
just<00:03:52.000> used<00:03:52.210> like<00:03:52.300> plastic<00:03:52.990> from<00:03:53.770> packaging

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
just used like plastic from packaging

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
just used like plastic from packaging
and<00:03:55.140> instead<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.230> what<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.410> normally<00:03:56.560> do<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.220> I

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
and instead of what I normally do is I

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.370 
and instead of what I normally do is I
put<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.790> windows<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.240> inside<00:03:58.600> that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
put the windows on the inside that

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.540 
put the windows on the inside that
wouldn't<00:03:59.680> work<00:03:59.830> because<00:04:00.100> they<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
wouldn't work because they have the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.540 
wouldn't work because they have the
thick<00:04:01.030> resin<00:04:01.510> body<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.200> car<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.280> just

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
thick resin body of the car so I just

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.699 
thick resin body of the car so I just
put<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.240> outside<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.870> then<00:04:05.080> I'm<00:04:05.230> asked

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
put it on the outside and then I'm asked

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.250 
put it on the outside and then I'm asked
them<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.070> painted<00:04:06.730> frames<00:04:07.209> on<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.690> think<00:04:08.110> it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
them and painted frames on I think it

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.570 
them and painted frames on I think it
actually<00:04:08.530> turned<00:04:08.739> out<00:04:08.890> pretty<00:04:09.190> good<00:04:09.400> they

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
actually turned out pretty good they

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.449 
actually turned out pretty good they
almost<00:04:09.760> look<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.060> wooden<00:04:10.890> framed<00:04:11.890> glass

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
almost look like wooden framed glass

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.949 
almost look like wooden framed glass
windows<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> I'll<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:16.480> show<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.840> few

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
windows so I'll just show you a few

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.199 
windows so I'll just show you a few
quick<00:04:17.260> photos<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.859> took<00:04:17.919> with<00:04:18.220> my<00:04:18.430> cell<00:04:18.700> phone

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
quick photos I took with my cell phone

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.420 
quick photos I took with my cell phone
as<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.540> progressed<00:04:20.040> doing<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> different

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
as I progressed doing the different

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:31.390 
as I progressed doing the different
patches<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.270> stuff<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> paint

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:05:22.879 

you

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.230 

so<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:23.949> started<00:05:24.249> working<00:05:24.369> on<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.639> few<00:05:24.969> more

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
so I started working on a few more

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.739 
so I started working on a few more
little<00:05:25.509> detail<00:05:26.319> things<00:05:26.619> for<00:05:27.009> my<00:05:27.300> fremo<00:05:28.300> module

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
little detail things for my fremo module

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.929 
little detail things for my fremo module
one<00:05:29.589> of<00:05:29.709> them<00:05:29.800> is<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:30.039> make<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.339> switch<00:05:30.580> stand

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
one of them is to make the switch stand

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.499 
one of them is to make the switch stand
for<00:05:31.779> the<00:05:31.899> siding<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:32.849> going<00:05:33.849> off<00:05:33.969> prototype

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
for the siding and going off prototype

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.510 
for the siding and going off prototype
for<00:05:34.749> roads<00:05:34.959> I<00:05:35.050> noticed<00:05:35.349> that<00:05:35.559> they're<00:05:35.770> fairly

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
for roads I noticed that they're fairly

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.059 
for roads I noticed that they're fairly
similar<00:05:36.699> not<00:05:37.209> exact<00:05:37.599> but<00:05:38.050> pretty<00:05:38.529> close<00:05:38.800> to

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
similar not exact but pretty close to

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.299 
similar not exact but pretty close to
the<00:05:39.189> Osborne<00:05:39.669> model<00:05:39.999> kits<00:05:40.289> so<00:05:41.289> I<00:05:41.319> just<00:05:41.649> cut<00:05:42.159> the

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:42.309 
the Osborne model kits so I just cut the

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.429 
the Osborne model kits so I just cut the
stand<00:05:42.550> off<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.149> Osborne<00:05:43.719> model<00:05:44.020> kits<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.379> I

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
stand off the Osborne model kits and I

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.179 
stand off the Osborne model kits and I
built<00:05:44.709> a<00:05:44.860> custom<00:05:45.069> switch<00:05:46.059> target<00:05:46.979> based<00:05:47.979> on

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:48.189 
built a custom switch target based on

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.010 
built a custom switch target based on
the<00:05:48.309> prototype<00:05:48.520> photos<00:05:49.059> and<00:05:49.629> actually<00:05:49.899> really

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
the prototype photos and actually really

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.689 
the prototype photos and actually really
happy<00:05:50.379> with<00:05:50.589> the<00:05:50.740> way<00:05:51.039> it<00:05:51.159> turned<00:05:51.339> out<00:05:51.520> and

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
happy with the way it turned out and

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.719 
happy with the way it turned out and
it's<00:05:51.819> operable<00:05:52.300> too<00:05:52.509> which<00:05:52.719> is<00:05:52.839> cool<00:05:56.729> there's

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
it's operable too which is cool there's

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.079 
it's operable too which is cool there's
a<00:05:57.819> dime<00:05:58.119> for<00:05:58.659> size<00:05:59.529> comparison<00:05:59.559> so<00:06:00.339> the<00:06:00.490> square

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
a dime for size comparison so the square

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.869 
a dime for size comparison so the square
part<00:06:01.389> of<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.689> target<00:06:02.199> is<00:06:02.349> built<00:06:02.679> out<00:06:02.889> of<00:06:03.159> scrap

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
part of the target is built out of scrap

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.989 
part of the target is built out of scrap
brass<00:06:04.209> and<00:06:04.599> that<00:06:05.110> is<00:06:05.229> painted<00:06:05.529> green<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:06.269> the

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:08.999 
brass and that is painted green and the

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:12.359 
brass and that is painted green and the
circle<00:06:09.999> part<00:06:10.619> for<00:06:11.619> lining<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:12.009> switch<00:06:12.219> in

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:12.369 
circle part for lining the switch in

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.820 
circle part for lining the switch in
Reverse<00:06:12.779> that's<00:06:13.779> just<00:06:14.139> made<00:06:14.319> out<00:06:14.559> of<00:06:15.300> leftover

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
Reverse that's just made out of leftover

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.869 
Reverse that's just made out of leftover
elevator<00:06:17.830> leg<00:06:18.519> like<00:06:19.119> this<00:06:19.679> and<00:06:20.679> I<00:06:21.369> just<00:06:21.399> sliced

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
elevator leg like this and I just sliced

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.639 
elevator leg like this and I just sliced
a<00:06:22.059> thin<00:06:22.389> chunk<00:06:22.689> of<00:06:22.809> it<00:06:22.899> and<00:06:23.080> then<00:06:23.199> cut<00:06:23.469> it<00:06:23.499> in

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:23.649 
a thin chunk of it and then cut it in

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.259 
a thin chunk of it and then cut it in
half<00:06:23.889> and<00:06:24.159> glued<00:06:24.339> it<00:06:24.369> on<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.639> brass<00:06:24.879> and

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:25.269 
half and glued it on the brass and

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:28.109 
half and glued it on the brass and
painted<00:06:26.019> it<00:06:26.139> so<00:06:26.349> really<00:06:27.249> pleased<00:06:27.639> with<00:06:27.849> that

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:28.119 
painted it so really pleased with that

website I found I'll put a link in the

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:02.790 
website I found I'll put a link in the
video<00:07:01.119> info<00:07:01.289> seem<00:07:02.289> pretty<00:07:02.499> straightforward

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
video info seem pretty straightforward

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.299 
video info seem pretty straightforward
though<00:07:03.279> it's<00:07:03.490> just<00:07:03.849> a<00:07:03.969> 1.5<00:07:04.599> volt<00:07:04.959> bug<00:07:05.860> zapper

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 
though it's just a 1.5 volt bug zapper

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.149 
though it's just a 1.5 volt bug zapper
basically<00:07:06.789> takes<00:07:07.119> two<00:07:07.300> D<00:07:07.509> batteries<00:07:07.979> and<00:07:08.979> you

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
basically takes two D batteries and you

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:10.799 
basically takes two D batteries and you
just<00:07:09.309> gotta<00:07:09.519> push<00:07:09.729> the<00:07:09.759> button<00:07:09.909> this<00:07:10.569> is<00:07:10.629> a

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:10.809 
just gotta push the button this is a

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:13.829 
just gotta push the button this is a
strainer<00:07:11.199> from<00:07:11.439> the<00:07:11.529> dollar<00:07:11.740> store<00:07:11.860> and<00:07:12.569> I<00:07:13.569> saw

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:13.839 
strainer from the dollar store and I saw

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.989 
strainer from the dollar store and I saw
dirt<00:07:14.050> attack<00:07:14.409> a<00:07:14.769> thumbtack<00:07:15.249> this<00:07:15.669> I<00:07:15.879> don't

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:15.999 
dirt attack a thumbtack this I don't

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:18.929 
dirt attack a thumbtack this I don't
know<00:07:16.059> if<00:07:16.149> it'll<00:07:16.240> work<00:07:16.329> or<00:07:16.569> not<00:07:16.689> but<00:07:17.849> I'm<00:07:18.849> gonna

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:18.939 
know if it'll work or not but I'm gonna

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:23.069 
know if it'll work or not but I'm gonna
try<00:07:19.240> that<00:07:19.269> and<00:07:19.569> see<00:07:19.629> if<00:07:19.749> it<00:07:19.899> works<00:07:21.119> and<00:07:22.119> modify

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:23.079 
try that and see if it works and modify

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.619 
try that and see if it works and modify
the<00:07:23.139> design<00:07:23.619> if<00:07:23.829> I<00:07:23.919> have<00:07:24.069> to<00:07:24.279> but<00:07:25.089> I<00:07:25.360> think<00:07:25.419> it

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629 
the design if I have to but I think it

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:28.589 
the design if I have to but I think it
cost<00:07:25.869> me<00:07:26.079> maybe<00:07:26.259> 20<00:07:26.740> bucks<00:07:26.919> I<00:07:27.449> think<00:07:28.449> it

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 
cost me maybe 20 bucks I think it

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:29.669 
cost me maybe 20 bucks I think it
probably<00:07:28.689> could<00:07:28.929> have<00:07:28.959> done<00:07:29.050> a<00:07:29.139> cheaper<00:07:29.529> if<00:07:29.619> I

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:29.679 
probably could have done a cheaper if I

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.709 
probably could have done a cheaper if I
want<00:07:29.860> to<00:07:29.919> bought<00:07:30.789> a<00:07:30.819> bug<00:07:31.180> zapper<00:07:31.209> just<00:07:31.659> I'm

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:31.719 
want to bought a bug zapper just I'm

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:32.790 
want to bought a bug zapper just I'm
like<00:07:31.839> at<00:07:31.899> the<00:07:31.959> dollar<00:07:32.139> store<00:07:32.229> because<00:07:32.709> I

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
like at the dollar store because I

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.379 
like at the dollar store because I
realize<00:07:33.249> they're<00:07:33.430> about<00:07:33.639> three<00:07:33.879> bucks<00:07:34.059> when<00:07:34.360> I

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:34.389 
realize they're about three bucks when I

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:35.189 
realize they're about three bucks when I
went<00:07:34.599> there

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 
went there

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.059 
went there
yeah<00:07:36.199> you<00:07:36.379> could<00:07:36.499> probably<00:07:36.559> build<00:07:36.800> one<00:07:37.009> of

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 
yeah you could probably build one of

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.329 
yeah you could probably build one of
these<00:07:37.129> for<00:07:37.309> under<00:07:37.339> $10<00:07:38.439> versus<00:07:39.439> spending

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:40.339 
these for under $10 versus spending

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:43.919 
these for under $10 versus spending
I<00:07:40.369> think<00:07:40.789> the<00:07:40.969> knock<00:07:41.270> one<00:07:41.899> is<00:07:42.139> 200<00:07:43.069> bucks

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:43.929 
I think the knock one is 200 bucks
