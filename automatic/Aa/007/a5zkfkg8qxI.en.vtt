00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is the only one we could find I think

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420

it's for cake pops but it kind of looks
like<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> bunch<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.850> butts<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:46.469> what

the<00:02:05.549> next<00:02:05.729> step<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:07.160> put<00:02:08.160> them<00:02:08.369> into<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the next step is to put them into the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.780 
the next step is to put them into the
mold<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.080> probably<00:02:10.590> recommend<00:02:11.009> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
mold so I probably recommend like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.340 
mold so I probably recommend like
strategically<00:02:12.510> putting<00:02:12.750> them<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> special

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
strategically putting them in a special

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
strategically putting them in a special
if<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.470> don't<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.800> many<00:02:13.920> colors<00:02:14.340> or

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
if you don't have that many colors or

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600 
if you don't have that many colors or
you<00:02:15.360> had<00:02:15.450> larger<00:02:15.780> pieces<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> always

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you had larger pieces but you can always

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.420 
you had larger pieces but you can always
just<00:02:17.850> pour<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> into<00:02:18.360> no<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.620> filled<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just pour it into no so we filled up the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.800 
just pour it into no so we filled up the
tray<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:23.970> all

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
tray as you can see it's just like all

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
tray as you can see it's just like all
mixed<00:02:25.200> up<00:02:25.320> that's<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.890> effect<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.220> want<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
mixed up that's the effect you want to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.630 
mixed up that's the effect you want to
go<00:02:26.520> for<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.780> recommend<00:02:28.650> filling<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.400> tray<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
go for I recommend filling the tray a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
go for I recommend filling the tray a
little<00:02:30.030> bit<00:02:30.180> above<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.860> edge<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.000> each<00:02:33.150> cup<00:02:33.510> or

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
little bit above the edge of each cup or

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.380 
little bit above the edge of each cup or
mold<00:02:34.740> or<00:02:34.950> whatever<00:02:35.190> you're<00:02:35.310> using<00:02:35.390> you'll

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
mold or whatever you're using you'll

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
mold or whatever you're using you'll
probably<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> put<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.710> tray<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.520> pan

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
probably want to put the tray on a pan

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.410 
probably want to put the tray on a pan
just<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:39.930> any<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.280> spills<00:02:41.790> over<00:02:42.060> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
just so if any of it spills over it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.540 
just so if any of it spills over it
doesn't<00:02:42.660> spill<00:02:42.840> into<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.230> oven<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.430> mess<00:02:44.520> up

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
doesn't spill into the oven and mess up

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.590 
doesn't spill into the oven and mess up
your<00:02:44.790> oven<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.300> ruin<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.510> forever<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:51.420> I've

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
your oven and ruin it forever and I've

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.730 
your oven and ruin it forever and I've
seen<00:02:51.750> different<00:02:51.900> directions<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
seen different directions for this

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.920 
seen different directions for this
online<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.550> last<00:02:53.760> time<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> tried<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.390> did<00:02:54.570> 15

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
online the last time I tried it I did 15

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.990 
online the last time I tried it I did 15
minutes<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.560> they<00:02:56.010> burnt<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.580> bit<00:02:56.760> so

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
minutes and they burnt a little bit so

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.300 
minutes and they burnt a little bit so
let's<00:02:57.240> try<00:02:57.390> 10<00:02:57.660> minutes<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.580> start<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:02.070> it's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
let's try 10 minutes and start so it's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
let's try 10 minutes and start so it's
been<00:03:02.490> 10<00:03:02.670> minutes<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.330> let's<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.600> what

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
been 10 minutes and let's see what

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.010 
been 10 minutes and let's see what
happened<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.450> looks<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:06.840> haven't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
happened and it looks like they haven't

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:18.650 
happened and it looks like they haven't
really<00:03:07.290> melted<00:03:07.920> yet<00:03:10.160> yeah<00:03:16.880> all<00:03:17.880> right<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.600> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
really melted yet yeah all right so it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690 
really melted yet yeah all right so it
looks<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.900> they're<00:03:19.080> done<00:03:19.230> now<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:20.490> seems

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
looks like they're done now so it seems

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.480 
looks like they're done now so it seems
like<00:03:20.760> 15<00:03:21.180> minutes<00:03:21.360> at<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> key<00:03:21.870> whoops<00:03:22.490> let's

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
like 15 minutes at the key whoops let's

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.070 
like 15 minutes at the key whoops let's
build<00:03:23.880> some<00:03:24.090> wax<00:03:24.300> that's<00:03:24.540> why<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.750> want<00:03:24.960> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
build some wax that's why you want the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.530 
build some wax that's why you want the
tray<00:03:25.260> underneath<00:03:25.760> all<00:03:26.760> right<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.210> let<00:03:27.390> them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
tray underneath all right so let them

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.500 
tray underneath all right so let them
sit<00:03:27.840> until<00:03:28.200> they're<00:03:28.320> cool<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.910> don't<00:03:30.030> want<00:03:30.240> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
sit until they're cool you don't want to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.610 
sit until they're cool you don't want to
stick<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.810> hands<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.320> hot<00:03:31.440> wax

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
