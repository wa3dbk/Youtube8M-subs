00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.949 
everything I've written my fair share
out<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:29.010> squeeze<00:03:30.010> chute<00:03:30.220> here<00:03:30.459> which<00:03:31.000> is

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.780 

the<00:03:34.959> gates<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.410> hinge<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.830> runway<00:03:36.160> they're

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the gates a hinge to the runway they're

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.449 
the gates a hinge to the runway they're
running<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> wrong<00:03:37.300> way<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:38.320> had<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.340> have

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
running the wrong way so had to have

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.340 
running the wrong way so had to have
someone<00:03:39.730> stand<00:03:40.120> right<00:03:40.390> there<00:03:40.420> at<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> gate<00:03:40.959> to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
someone stand right there at the gate to

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.670 
someone stand right there at the gate to
make<00:03:41.500> sure<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.769> didn't<00:03:41.980> smash<00:03:42.220> into<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.610> gate

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.310 

anyways<00:03:47.680> that's<00:03:47.980> where<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.280> all<00:03:48.370> started

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
anyways that's where it all started

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.440 
anyways that's where it all started
give<00:03:50.320> me
