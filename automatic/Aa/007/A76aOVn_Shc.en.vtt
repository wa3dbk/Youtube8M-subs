00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 tool that comes out of the exchange 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.469

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 negative terminal 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 here we have a car from an area that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 there is also subject to moisture also 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 But it's okay, we have a reinforcement, but this one. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 car here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:39.540
