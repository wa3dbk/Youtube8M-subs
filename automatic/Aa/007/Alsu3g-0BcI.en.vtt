00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 5 33 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.889
 is it cost 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.759
 what do you advise me 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.539
 Brought package 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.949
 that I'm with you now 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.949
 May wants to carry out 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.970
 weapons 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 background 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 stolen 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.510
 and open it all up 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 first have him 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.000
 Vogt committed 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.390
 Making processes worry Although I have chosen with the doormat 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.650
 we achieve 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.750
 there can already be tons of 5000 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.050
 100 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.840
 to the fore 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.330
 and a lot 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
 Napoleon or bubbles 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 stake 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 pay attention to envy a screw cat 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.340
 so 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.650
 Dannenberg 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.860
 Schilling carton Tat aside 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.550
 8 he said 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 8100 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 they offered themselves 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.150
 and here we have one 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.750
 operation manual 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.370
 on b 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.680
 there the readers can be lightened 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.070
 and also inside de s 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 continue the marriages now 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.470
 which is finally exciting 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.120
 but not quite to go 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.160
 I do not know 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 we were in the starting eleven in his honor 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.990
 What is it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.650
 granted to German cities 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.450
 to solve 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.420
 elected for the works council 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.790
 stand next to 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 So it remains on-board blame 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.020
 Not everyone of the 3000 players known to America 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 Here I have been once in the evening 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.190
 it is 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.609
 what buys 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.889
 round 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.129
 Sausage goes 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.529
 Naturally 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.879
 Percent again 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.749
 as well as Lafayette percent what they logically receive 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.489
 trier 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 and here Okulaja 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.839
 strong off 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.109
 here shares 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.049
 Beatrice w 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 The result is a process now 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.220
 she is Stuttgart for the time being 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.729
 there it is chic the pc market Vienna 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.569
 yes, here it is determined 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.620
 September among other things makes the T-question 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.319
 then he is actually too late, she could have new camera again 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.899
 now a new one 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.289
 but that's easy to explain 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:25.520
 and indeed all this camera Davies year has been re-imagined 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.679
 from Nikon 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:31.579
 and now the former first or penultimate week was not the exact one 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.729
 Date with chalk 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:33.979
 come up 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.869
 and so that the d3100 covered kfd members then too much money 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:39.889
 have to be 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.029
 this is Weber in al-sintan 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.169
 i have that only after baden-wÃ¼rttemberg is enormous 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.219
 to get the money you find the depth 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219
 Percent that's me now percent 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.049
 to buy the logic titles 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.919
 needed what is not so please nowhere I now you 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.480
 Price must not have much with the annual anyway 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.069
 Yes 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.749
 the HSG ahlen-hamm hat tricks percent 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:09.629
 and percent 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.840
 Years you can see 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.110
 on the front side 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.499
 not much new 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:15.649
 around 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.759
 At the top of the back you can see 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.939
 go here 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.849
 easily the youth the image of Islam 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.889
 general tenor year before 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.610
 here at the reception 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 and here is also the developer baking to record video 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.020
 hiked up 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.590
 in fact 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.279
 because the settlers are now 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.719
 at least 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.999
 That's not the actual thing about this camera 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.580
 restricts Asbeck 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.099
 the display is also much higher in percentage than what Dr was doing 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.840
 currently come 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.940
 that's really good, they must have bought the chamber opera 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.870
 and a little careful year you know yes or delivers a very large 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.330
 Part of my interest in this first one 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.449
 is the video record and that's why you can do that, of course 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.590
 This was the main reason why sitting here today 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.819
 have brought 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.120
 that's what we are doing 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.300
 it is called once 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.659
 shortly 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.659
 already the speedometer said that 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.999
 Yeah, Yeahs arrive 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.039
 and 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 Jades visitors reasonably update for as well 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.080
 here again the divisions meadows German and the time zone 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.180
 now the appointment 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.379
 then we have the franc yes 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.110
 and remove again 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.689
 2001 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.689
 Month is also the title you're a good one 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.620
 Bonn so far 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.479
 46 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.129
 proven 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.309
 also concerns 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.419
 finished 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.199
 yes and that's next to it even looks a bit different than domain names 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.860
 and Andy Cole 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.499
 yes I know now percent 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.529
 times 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.300
 to play 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.960
 with this camera 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.719
 and rehearsals, yes, maybe the World Cup is coming 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.469
 he still looks 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.500
 the innocent people ahead 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.279
 possibly slightly worse picture quality 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.900
 because I know that he is using the windows machine 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.719
 now were too 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.539
 and around 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.219
 and I have not been so busy with the program yet and that's why 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.360
 because she is not exactly sure if that will be great 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.860
 but now percent with their food dealing with the chamber and percent yes because 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.020
 it is nowhere to be seen and that is
