00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
now I'm taking a plum color as well as a

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.969 
now I'm taking a plum color as well as a
small<00:04:24.840> flat<00:04:25.200> brush<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.620> I'm<00:04:25.770> going

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
small flat brush and I'm going

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.610 
small flat brush and I'm going
underneath<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> lash<00:04:27.090> line<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.690> dragging<00:04:28.500> it

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
underneath the lash line and dragging it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.409

all the way to my winged liner and I

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.969 
all the way to my winged liner and I
think<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> step<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.440> lots<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.919> people

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
think this is a step that lots of people

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.700 
think this is a step that lots of people
skip<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.240> really<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:33.780> important<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
skip and it really is important and it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.460 
skip and it really is important and it
gives<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.100> full<00:04:35.639> lash<00:04:36.240> effect<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.260> your

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470
