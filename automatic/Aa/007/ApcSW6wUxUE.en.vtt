00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
what color so if we want our characters

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.540 
what color so if we want our characters
hat<00:00:53.900> to<00:00:54.140> match<00:00:54.260> their<00:00:54.559> address<00:00:54.829> we<00:00:55.309> can<00:00:55.339> do

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
hat to match their address we can do

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.130 
hat to match their address we can do
that<00:00:55.730> but<00:00:55.970> we<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.239> also<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:56.659> it<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
that but we can also have it that the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.500 
that but we can also have it that the
Hat<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.530> different<00:00:57.799> colors<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.250> dress

Hat it's a different colors of the dress

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.969 
Hat it's a different colors of the dress
once<00:00:59.510> we<00:00:59.629> have<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.780> concept<00:01:00.199> for<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.650> character
