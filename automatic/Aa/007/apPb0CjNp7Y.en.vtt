see<00:00:30.849> Society<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:31.880> developing<00:00:32.360> guys<00:00:32.870> if<00:00:33.170> the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
see Society of developing guys if the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.620 
see Society of developing guys if the
factions<00:00:34.010> from<00:00:34.190> divergent<00:00:34.550> existed<00:00:35.330> which

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
factions from divergent existed which

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.710 
factions from divergent existed which
faction<00:00:36.170> would<00:00:36.560> you<00:00:36.740> choose<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:38.000> think<00:00:38.360> it's

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
faction would you choose I I think it's

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320 
faction would you choose I I think it's
really<00:00:39.140> tough<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.830> choose<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.430> faction<00:00:40.700> I<00:00:41.060> think

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
really tough to choose a faction I think

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.700 
really tough to choose a faction I think
that's<00:00:41.510> why<00:00:41.660> it's<00:00:41.870> called<00:00:42.020> divergent<00:00:42.590> and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
that's why it's called divergent and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.220 
that's why it's called divergent and
that<00:00:43.100> all<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.430> us<00:00:43.670> are<00:00:43.910> sort<00:00:44.150> of<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.570> little<00:00:44.960> bit

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
that all of us are sort of a little bit

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.310 
that all of us are sort of a little bit
divergent<00:00:46.030> because<00:00:47.030> people<00:00:47.360> can't<00:00:47.720> be<00:00:47.930> sort

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
divergent because people can't be sort

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.050 
divergent because people can't be sort
of<00:00:48.380> classified<00:00:48.800> into<00:00:49.040> one<00:00:49.070> single<00:00:49.550> faction<00:00:49.760> if

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
of classified into one single faction if

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.550 
of classified into one single faction if
I<00:00:50.210> had<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.540> choose<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:50.780> feel<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:51.200> my<00:00:51.380> choice

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
I had to choose I feel like my choice

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.200 
I had to choose I feel like my choice
would<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.740> different<00:00:52.100> every<00:00:52.160> day<00:00:52.280> some<00:00:52.820> days<00:00:53.030> I

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
would be different every day some days I

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.490 
would be different every day some days I
feel<00:00:53.240> like<00:00:53.420> being<00:00:53.540> a<00:00:53.750> dauntless<00:00:54.020> some<00:00:54.230> days<00:00:54.380> I

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
feel like being a dauntless some days I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.300 
feel like being a dauntless some days I
feel<00:00:54.620> like<00:00:54.680> being<00:00:54.860> an<00:00:54.950> erudite

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310

some days I feel like abnegation so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.970 
some days I feel like abnegation so
today<00:00:59.330> I<00:00:59.360> think<00:00:59.840> today<00:01:00.530> I'm<00:01:00.800> feeling

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
today I think today I'm feeling

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.160 
today I think today I'm feeling
dauntless<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.550> think<00:01:01.810> given<00:01:02.810> that<00:01:02.840> I'm<00:01:02.990> wearing

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
dauntless I think given that I'm wearing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.780 
dauntless I think given that I'm wearing
so<00:01:03.410> much<00:01:03.500> blue<00:01:03.800> today<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:04.189> probably<00:01:04.430> go<00:01:04.640> for

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
so much blue today I probably go for

so much blue today I probably go for
erudite<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.620> think<00:01:06.620> I'm<00:01:06.980> playing<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.490> right

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
erudite I think I'm playing the right

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.940 
erudite I think I'm playing the right
faction<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.390> think<00:01:08.600> dauntless<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.170> pretty<00:01:09.440> I

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
faction I think dauntless is pretty I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.280 
faction I think dauntless is pretty I
don't<00:01:10.070> know<00:01:10.280> casted<00:01:11.090> pretty<00:01:11.330> bang<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.870> but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
don't know casted pretty bang on but

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.200 
don't know casted pretty bang on but
you're<00:01:12.470> right<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.340> sort<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:13.940> you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
you're right and it's sort of like you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.000 
you're right and it's sort of like you
know<00:01:14.240> where<00:01:14.630> everything<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.410> that's<00:01:15.680> why

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
know where everything and that's why

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.720 
know where everything and that's why
ideally<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.970> our<00:01:17.150> world<00:01:17.710> divergence<00:01:18.730> aren't

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
ideally in our world divergence aren't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.200 
ideally in our world divergence aren't
good

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
good

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.810 
good
you<00:01:20.330> know<00:01:20.450> divergence<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.500> stir<00:01:21.770> stuff<00:01:22.580> up

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
you know divergence will stir stuff up

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.360 
you know divergence will stir stuff up
divergence<00:01:23.510> will<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.470> know<00:01:24.560> be<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.890> downfall

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
divergence will you know be the downfall

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.610 
divergence will you know be the downfall
of<00:01:25.510> faction<00:01:26.510> leaders<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.050> so<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.230> think<00:01:27.350> that's

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
of faction leaders and so I think that's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.149 
of faction leaders and so I think that's
what<00:01:27.770> people<00:01:27.800> don't<00:01:28.250> want<00:01:28.840> but<00:01:29.840> for<00:01:30.020> me<00:01:30.200> for

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
what people don't want but for me for

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.399 
what people don't want but for me for
the<00:01:31.220> most<00:01:31.400> part<00:01:31.670> I'm<00:01:31.940> pretty<00:01:32.000> dauntless<00:01:32.540> one

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
the most part I'm pretty dauntless one

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.660 
the most part I'm pretty dauntless one

set my family was a faction did you like
the<00:02:08.100> art<00:02:08.340> faction<00:02:08.850> cuz<00:02:09.150> most<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.450> parents<00:02:09.780> are

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the art faction cuz most my parents are

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
the art faction cuz most my parents are
artists<00:02:10.230> and<00:02:10.380> then<00:02:11.070> they<00:02:11.190> sort<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.490> brought<00:02:11.670> me

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
artists and then they sort of brought me

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.750

aren't acting like it's a job but at the
same<00:02:25.740> time<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.520> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> part<00:02:27.330> of
