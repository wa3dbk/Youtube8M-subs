00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.880
 hello and welcome to star wars 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.240
 episode 83 today with brown mountains and 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.470
 rocks as the first murder of manager 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.700
 The first time the fashion was seen 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.240
 I am a little unsure because I am only 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.750
 did not want to believe that skyrim with the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.239
 brown rock just look better 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.480
 can be considered with gray rock on the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.450
 north side is a screenshot because of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:15.180
 in real life he would be next to mountains 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.920
 brownish as horrible what does im 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 screenshot can look like that and the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.369
 Generally you were right in calving 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.290
 I'm not so sure 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 however I have in morrowind too 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 already seen brown textures for even 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 Bergen and I have to say if you can 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 because in there has a bmw and so on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.940
 as it looks very impressive 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 and from me anyway 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.690
 stay installed because it's easy 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.910
 awesome for screenshots the second murder 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.750
 For today, the sword circle adds more 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.790
 in addition 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.560
 I'm afraid I'm pronounced myself 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.260
 not sure the sword was already in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 morrowind and you are a lost car 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.070
 fact that is added here again 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.900
 I'm not sure if there is one more 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.620
 Another game of the elder scrolls 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.300
 was there 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.409
 but I do not have any of it now 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.880
 I read that quite myself 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.060
 unbelievable and the art with one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.729
 quest in solitude com in solitude it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340
 I will speak German as far as I know the city 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.600
 Of course I do when you look for sun 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.010
 then comes the quest 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.390
 automatically starts after a few 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.220
 seconds if not you can in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.100
 go temple and there you can this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.500
 Find the key on the cabinet 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.080
 have little evenly also activates the quest 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.470
 achievements as 250 here now 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.460
 Records are not working 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.410
 so strange no matter in any case you go 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.500
 the temple ever pulls down it 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.480
 sword out of the stone and you 're there 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.670
 here in a small dungeon in it 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 you have to bite through just there at the end 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.170
 then there is a priest meeting and 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.610
 Revenge do not forget that gold for this 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.310
 I do not have Luton at the beginning 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.890
 Looked when I am here but here 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.730
 you get a lot of cola the sword 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.300
 itself has damn horny enchantment 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.230
 and you have permanently 25% fire 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.540
 Resistance gets every three every second 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.750
 her three life points back no matter if you 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.820
 such a purchase or not 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.790
 And apart from that, it still has the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.940
 Effect that if you block all 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.770
 magic back reflect that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.770
 is also called the fire of this meeting of 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.570
 Dragon Brands goes here is damned 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.680
 hard and I play here to novice 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.630
 to make room for him 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.540
 I am taking the god mode off 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.580
 and you can see if you are from the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.580
 side all the time on him skin 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.000
 then you can get under his wing 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.560
 suffered and thus he can not you 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.290
 Do not bite anymore and hit the fire 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.940
 meteorite attack he hits him as and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.790
 the rest keeps circles more 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.300
 that's why it's pretty easy here 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.040
 I'm just level 4 23 a game on novize 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.420
 therefore it is in high end opponents 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.519
 if you are outside then then 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.290
 there is still the sword scabbard here 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.810
 you can use it if you use it 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.660
 then you just post krasimir again 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.940
 out and see it all again 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.709
 a corner hornier I have to say 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.430
 one of my favorite swords though 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.980
 not my favorite sword what two 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.209
 I do not know what 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.940
 I would like even better 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.229
 maybe the hell place but otherwise 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 Here you can again the enchantment 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.180
 see 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.590
 There is also a claim here 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.470
 which is added 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.060
 more of crisis that heals you and everyone 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.249
 allied within 10 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.309
 good, too 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.799
 feet meters Romans as you wanted to see 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:45.179
 actually kilometers and diseases 

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:50.079
 However, healing costs 25 percent 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:53.499
 enchantment charging charge 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.719
 a bit German called the dead if 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:59.649
 it should happen to you as often 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:02.109
 that some companion on 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.659
 mysterious way should die 

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:07.799
 then there is a mod that now 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:11.289
 whole roleplay friendly in one 

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:14.289
 acceptable light is on the way now 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.389
 this spell by bernadette the 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.099
 is also bernadette think 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.159
 equip and then just one 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:24.549
 conjure companion and then at the 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:27.039
 create a tombstone and the 

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:28.989
 says who is there and since when he 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.299
 I'm pretty much there personally 

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:33.279
 think the mother herself is cool 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:35.559
 pretty busy right now though 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.549
 he is just trying new options 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.159
 add 

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:43.449
 It has become quite a problem 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:45.699
 is among some people and many people 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.949
 For example, you want to have different gravestones 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.659
 for different races and so on 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.439
 and now I'm trying to install that 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.509
 I'm curious 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.699
 I think we can watch you for we can 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.319
 please give like if it has fallen 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.999
 in addition controls without the 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.949
 I would be very happy to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:02.159

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.159
 bye
