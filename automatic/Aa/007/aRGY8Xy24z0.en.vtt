00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
journey which is going to expose what

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
makes improvisation what it is and one

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.490 
makes improvisation what it is and one
way<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.110> find<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:41.680> out<00:00:41.739> is<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:43.239> examine<00:00:43.750> what

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
way to find that out is to examine what

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.319 
way to find that out is to examine what
an<00:00:44.590> artistic<00:00:44.950> expression<00:00:45.430> or<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.820> musical

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
an artistic expression or a musical

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.690 
an artistic expression or a musical
expression<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:46.960> made<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:48.160> maybe<00:00:48.340> we<00:00:48.550> can

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
expression is made of and maybe we can

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.970 
expression is made of and maybe we can
work<00:00:48.880> backwards<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.600> come<00:00:50.200> up<00:00:50.320> with<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.469> system

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
work backwards and come up with a system

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.670 
work backwards and come up with a system
of<00:00:51.450> improvisation<00:00:52.450> that<00:00:52.719> at<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.350> time

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
of improvisation that at this time

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.889 
of improvisation that at this time
doesn't<00:00:54.370> exist<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.270> world<00:00:55.480> that<00:00:55.750> I<00:00:55.780> can

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
doesn't exist in the world that I can

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.380 
doesn't exist in the world that I can
find<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:57.040> know<00:00:57.100> when<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:57.820> play<00:00:58.180> that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
find and I know when I play that

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.030 
find and I know when I play that
something's<00:00:58.899> going<00:00:59.290> on<00:00:59.410> in<00:00:59.649> here

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
something's going on in here

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.880

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
agree with me on what improvisation is

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.910 
agree with me on what improvisation is
and<00:01:08.440> how<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.280> do<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:11.080> going<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.470> start<00:01:11.770> off

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
and how to do it I'm going to start off

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.359 
and how to do it I'm going to start off
just<00:01:11.950> by<00:01:12.310> playing<00:01:12.760> some<00:01:13.090> examples<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.100> what

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
just by playing some examples and what

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.020 
just by playing some examples and what
I'm<00:01:15.490> going<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.790> do<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.860> describe<00:01:17.860> what<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.549> think

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
I'm going to do is describe what I think

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.690 
I'm going to do is describe what I think
makes<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.810> artistic<00:01:20.409> expression<00:01:20.950> exactly

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
makes that artistic expression exactly

00:01:21.700 --> 00:02:27.070 
makes that artistic expression exactly
what<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.000> is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.470 

or<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.140> could<00:02:28.440> call<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.120> 4/4<00:02:30.120> time<00:02:30.150> meaning<00:02:30.860> four

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
or I could call it 4/4 time meaning four

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.730 
or I could call it 4/4 time meaning four
quarter<00:02:33.480> notes<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:35.510> two<00:02:36.709> three<00:02:37.730> four
