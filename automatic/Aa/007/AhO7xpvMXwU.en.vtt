00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.129
 hello youtube friends greet you serian 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.380
 sun and this time I bring you this 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.720
 video that you create it exclusively by 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.020
 where are you going to be able to make your 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.050
 orders from the pokemon that want me 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.740
 upload remember that these pokemon are going to 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.509
 be legal and good event 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 depending on which they ask me but good 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.860
 let's see I will read the requirements for 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.320
 to place your order in order to upload the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.079
 pokemon that you want the first thing is 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.520
 be subscribed in the youtube channel 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.170
 leave your username with which you 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.670
 has registered because sometimes 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.530
 you change and I do not know if they are 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.270
 registered so it's very important 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.340
 leave the username with which 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.250
 be registered to know that they are 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.100
 subscribed second order a pokémon 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 legal or possible event for example 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.510
 you can ask I do not know a piccini touch that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.000
 if you can get it but not ask 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.479
 impossible not as for example can not 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.190
 ask for a means of it but because this one 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.130
 only delivered by event and there are no 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.190
 in its legal version does not exist in see in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.390
 version without you melo eta so this 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 it would be a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.400
 poet and legal leaf that did not touch many 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.490
 users do not care if the pokemon is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.610
 illegal or legal is a pokemon hack or 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 maybe they do not know if it's about this and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.200
 recommend pages where they abound 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.360
 pokemon hacks or illegal if you have a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.040
 game in r4 seemed like you do not run much 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.060
 risk but if you play in the cartridge 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.009
 original 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.590
 Worry because it could damage your game 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.690
 now this is not in many users I have 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 I read many comments including me 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.020
 send messages 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
 not all of course there are some that yes 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.860
 they help in a good way which I appreciate 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 but some get and write in this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 page there and when I see it they are 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.760
 illegal pokemon and I ask you to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 be very careful because as I already 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.380
 I explained in the video this can hurt your 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.179
 clear game that if you have a r4 there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.520
 you would lose a lot but if you have a game 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.130
 original you would lose quite 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 good still if they want some pokemon 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 You can also ask for it illegally 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.490
 I want the comments to tell me 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.510
 is illegal or there is no other sub is 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.370
 pokemon hacked if I do not know what because if 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.260
 I would upload it because you ask for it and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.690
 I've seen that many videos do not 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.940
 interesting if they want a legal pokémon or 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.280
 illegal really if I would look a little 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.250
 in mont so 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.900
 this pokemon this would not harm your game 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.230
 it would only be useful for them to have it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.150
 in the game you can not show your friends 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.240
 they will not be able to participate in battles 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.640
 official or wi-fi and good clearly 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.410
 it would only serve to have it in its 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.430
 new game fight with him without giving 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.400
 cause them no harm ok this is already 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.020
 I have already checked this and I want them 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.020
 I can upload to your request 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.170
 good this the following any 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.440
 pokemon of great events that ask 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.209
 the orders will be in this video in the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.709
 comments of this video not by 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.569
 facebook or in other videos 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.550
 exclusively in this video why 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.830
 because that's how I'm going to see 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.280
 ordered that pokemons want you and 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 I will go up or along it to what 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.519
 throughout the course 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.719
 what happens so that you can 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.150
 that I can upload the pokemon that 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.790
 you wish so please in this 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.379
 video the event pokemon that goes up 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.939
 will have to have a minimum of two hundred 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.519
 views of what that means is that 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.489
 noticed that many users congratulate me 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.379
 and to which I thank all this but 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.810
 I have not seen that shown in the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.760
 videos because I've seen that for example 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.260
 the last video that I uploaded about dragon 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.540
 knight for fourth generation that was of 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.489
 event to the jousts reached 100 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.669
 seen which for me is worrying 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.889
 because I only ask you to support me 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.799
 watching the video nothing more simply with 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.090
 that you see, they support me a lot 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.920
 but 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.980
 where he forced himself to see if you do not 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.989
 they wish they are free not to do so if 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.900
 They want to support me if I only ask them 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.359
 that they watch my videos nothing more and good 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.949
 why decided that now every time 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.480
 a Pokémon of events pass the 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.280
 two hundred views 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.280
 I will upload another video 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.640
 of another event pokemon that they have 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.000
 asked you there I'll explain to you 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.950
 more in depth how is this going to be 7 just 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.930
 ask a little more for comment by 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.480
 please and do not ask for pokemones with many 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.190
 specifications for example do not ask for a 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.770
 charme and the air with level both with 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.570
 such attacks against the skill because 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.960
 it's very complicated to get is almost 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.730
 impossible ok for example is the way in 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.710
 what they should ask for is like this if I am a 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.650
 register with the nickname of Miguel Angel that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.540
 I'm asking you for a level 5 chesini torch to 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.460
 the ones for the fourth pokémon game 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.500
 generation here clear fourth games 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.080
 generation is diamond pearl platinum 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.970
 here gold and sol silver so they have 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.980
 to put a fourth generation if yes 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.690
 they have one of those games and fifth 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.720
 generation if you have black and white 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.710
 one or two black and white 1 and 2 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.060
 clarification if you want for the fifth 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.460
 generation you must ask in another 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.740
 comment saying that he wants to be an actor 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.960
 chic without and of level 5 for 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.960
 the fifth generation 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.380
 good if you have to do so 9 does not 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.389
 ask not to repeat orders if they asked for a 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.069
 pokémon that you wanted simply to 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.590
 I like that comment for example 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.270
 if you liked a torchin and 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.860
 level 5 for fourth generation gives me 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.889
 like that comment then I'm going to 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.130
 see this comment and if you have enough 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.770
 positive votes I will upload that pokemon 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.160
 legal without ok or if it is a pokémon of 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.259
 event or the one they have requested will be 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.930
 deleted repeated comments whether 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.789
 they are repeating that block when blocking 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.570
 to users who spam or that 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.570
 keep repeating 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.400
 your orders and users 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.229
 and by blocking users who do 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.240
 disrespect in the channel 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.169
 you are free and I did not force you to 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:24.570
 that you see my videos and I thank the 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:26.759

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.340
 ask a lot only I appreciate this 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.960
 I appreciate that you watch the videos and that's why 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.900

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:46.410

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.250

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.590
