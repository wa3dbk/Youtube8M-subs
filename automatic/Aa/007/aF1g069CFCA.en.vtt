sometimes<00:00:04.580> we're<00:00:04.790> working<00:00:05.089> on<00:00:05.210> like

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
sometimes we're working on like

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.630 
sometimes we're working on like
aerospace<00:00:06.020> projects<00:00:06.560> that<00:00:06.799> require<00:00:07.220> a<00:00:07.250> very

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
aerospace projects that require a very

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.089 
aerospace projects that require a very
tight<00:00:08.330> controlled<00:00:08.929> way<00:00:09.139> of<00:00:09.320> working<00:00:09.740> but<00:00:09.889> then

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
tight controlled way of working but then

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.400 
tight controlled way of working but then
when<00:00:10.820> we're<00:00:10.940> working<00:00:11.090> on<00:00:11.420> artistic<00:00:11.960> projects

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
when we're working on artistic projects

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.730 
when we're working on artistic projects
it<00:00:12.740> requires<00:00:13.370> a<00:00:13.519> very<00:00:13.880> fluid<00:00:14.420> way<00:00:14.719> of<00:00:15.320> thinking

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
it requires a very fluid way of thinking

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.080 
it requires a very fluid way of thinking
that's<00:00:16.279> one<00:00:16.460> of<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.609> great<00:00:16.760> things<00:00:16.970> about

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
that's one of the great things about

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.240 
that's one of the great things about
Telecom<00:00:17.779> it<00:00:18.380> allows<00:00:18.590> me<00:00:18.770> to<00:00:18.859> think<00:00:18.890> as<00:00:19.220> a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
Telecom it allows me to think as a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.120 
Telecom it allows me to think as a
craftsman<00:00:19.670> I<00:00:19.970> was<00:00:20.420> very<00:00:20.750> interested<00:00:20.960> in<00:00:21.230> being

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
craftsman I was very interested in being

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.279 
craftsman I was very interested in being
able<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.369> take<00:00:22.550> craft<00:00:23.180> back<00:00:23.420> into<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.900> the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
and the robot assist with a lot of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.550 
and the robot assist with a lot of
different<00:00:29.180> operations<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:29.929> would<00:00:30.260> require

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
different operations that would require

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.920 
different operations that would require
vast<00:00:31.220> amounts<00:00:31.670> of<00:00:31.760> labor<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.360> lot<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.840> our

vast amounts of labor a lot of our

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.410 
vast amounts of labor a lot of our
processes<00:00:33.140> are<00:00:33.620> based<00:00:34.070> from<00:00:34.610> hand<00:00:34.910> creation

processes are based from hand creation

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.200 
processes are based from hand creation
based<00:00:35.870> on<00:00:36.079> very<00:00:36.350> old<00:00:36.440> techniques<00:00:37.370> like<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
based on very old techniques like the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.270 
based on very old techniques like the
ability<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.570> manipulate<00:00:38.840> materials<00:00:39.710> by<00:00:39.950> hand

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
ability to manipulate materials by hand

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.459 
ability to manipulate materials by hand
and<00:00:40.399> knowing<00:00:40.940> what<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:41.210> feedback<00:00:42.050> comes

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
and knowing what that feedback comes

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.369 
and knowing what that feedback comes
from<00:00:42.680> material<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.280> power<00:00:44.120> mill<00:00:44.300> allows<00:00:44.750> us

from material and power mill allows us

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.170 
from material and power mill allows us
to<00:00:45.649> work<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.190> way<00:00:46.399> that's<00:00:46.640> similar<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.120> that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
to work in a way that's similar to that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.120 
to work in a way that's similar to that
this<00:00:49.720> is<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.900> project<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.530> we're<00:00:50.770> working<00:00:51.040> on

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
this is a project that we're working on

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.240 
this is a project that we're working on
a<00:00:51.160> direct<00:00:51.700> mold<00:00:51.970> for<00:00:52.390> an<00:00:52.840> electric<00:00:53.290> bus<00:00:53.500> we

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
a direct mold for an electric bus we

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.730 
a direct mold for an electric bus we
didn't<00:00:54.580> undercut<00:00:54.850> spray<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:55.900> composite<00:00:56.380> on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
didn't undercut spray and composite on

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.760 
didn't undercut spray and composite on
top<00:00:56.950> of<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.610> foam<00:00:58.120> using<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.780> robot<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.440> then

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
top of the foam using the robot and then

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.190 
top of the foam using the robot and then
right<00:01:00.310> now<00:01:00.489> we're<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.910> process<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.630> doing

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
right now we're in the process of doing

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.049 
right now we're in the process of doing
the<00:01:02.440> roughing<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.950> finish<00:01:03.220> cuts<00:01:03.460> with

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the roughing and the finish cuts with

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.820 
the roughing and the finish cuts with
the<00:01:04.150> robot<00:01:04.420> milling<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:05.110> really<00:01:05.440> want<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.710> be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
the robot milling you really want to be

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.190 
the robot milling you really want to be
able<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.130> control<00:01:06.820> every<00:01:07.210> axis<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.780> that's

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
able to control every axis and that's

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.750 
able to control every axis and that's
one<00:01:08.650> of<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> great<00:01:08.890> things<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.190> power<00:01:09.550> mill

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
one of the great things that power mill

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.969 
one of the great things that power mill
and<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.030> PRI<00:01:10.330> interface<00:01:10.869> allows<00:01:11.320> me<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:11.770> I

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
and the PRI interface allows me to do I

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.580 
and the PRI interface allows me to do I
can<00:01:12.640> position<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.390> get<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.750> robot<00:01:13.930> exactly

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
can position and get the robot exactly

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.890 
can position and get the robot exactly
where<00:01:15.220> I<00:01:15.250> want<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.880> then<00:01:16.270> proceed<00:01:16.869> to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
where I want to and then proceed to

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.230 
where I want to and then proceed to
running<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.710> simulation<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.790> toolpath

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
running the simulation of the toolpath

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.060 
running the simulation of the toolpath
I<00:01:19.479> looked<00:01:19.869> at<00:01:19.990> other<00:01:20.200> packages<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:20.860> you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
I looked at other packages that you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.130 
I looked at other packages that you
would<00:01:21.280> have<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.520> export<00:01:21.970> your<00:01:22.149> tooling<00:01:22.780> file

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
would have to export your tooling file

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.320 
would have to export your tooling file
and<00:01:23.410> then<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:24.009> would<00:01:24.130> have<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.640> run<00:01:25.270> a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
and then you would have to run a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.510 
and then you would have to run a
simulation<00:01:25.600> now<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.590> do<00:01:26.680> everything<00:01:26.979> in

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
simulation now I can do everything in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.880 
simulation now I can do everything in
one<00:01:27.910> package<00:01:28.149> we<00:01:28.720> do<00:01:28.869> milling<00:01:29.200> but<00:01:29.380> we<00:01:29.470> also<00:01:29.590> do

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
one package we do milling but we also do

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.639 
one package we do milling but we also do
spraying<00:01:30.520> wire<00:01:31.240> cutting<00:01:31.630> other<00:01:32.020> operations

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
spraying wire cutting other operations

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.650 
spraying wire cutting other operations
that<00:01:32.830> need<00:01:32.890> vector<00:01:33.610> control<00:01:33.970> because<00:01:34.540> of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
that need vector control because of

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.510 
that need vector control because of
these<00:01:34.810> controls<00:01:35.229> I'm<00:01:35.470> able<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.770> use<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.250> for

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
these controls I'm able to use it for

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.670 
these controls I'm able to use it for
applications<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.300> aren't<00:01:37.540> point<00:01:37.930> dependent

applications that aren't point dependent
I<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:39.160> using<00:01:39.340> surf<00:01:39.610> cam<00:01:39.880> at<00:01:40.030> one<00:01:40.180> time<00:01:40.390> then

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
I was using surf cam at one time then

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.460 
I was using surf cam at one time then
when<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:42.940> started<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.450> process<00:01:44.080> of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
when I started the process of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.080 
when I started the process of
integrating<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.190> robot<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.580> looked<00:01:45.940> at

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
integrating the robot I looked at

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.889 
integrating the robot I looked at
unigraphics

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
unigraphics

efficient manner basically we went from

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.550 
efficient manner basically we went from
trying<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.790> program<00:01:54.790> something<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.560> would

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
trying to program something that would

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.280 
trying to program something that would
take<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:57.100> day<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.150> program<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:59.049> being<00:01:59.229> able

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
take a day just a program to being able

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.620 
take a day just a program to being able
to<00:01:59.440> do<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.799> five<00:02:00.070> minutes<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
to do it in five minutes so the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.500 
to do it in five minutes so the
improvements<00:02:02.110> were<00:02:03.000> substantial<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.180> have

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
improvements were substantial I have

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.410 
improvements were substantial I have
assurance<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.200> what<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.560> see<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:07.180> is

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
assurance that what I see here is

assurance that what I see here is
exactly<00:02:07.689> what<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.260> getting<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.890> shop

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
exactly what I'm getting on the shop

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.859 
exactly what I'm getting on the shop
floor<00:02:09.330> after<00:02:10.330> I've<00:02:10.420> checked<00:02:10.660> for

floor after I've checked for

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.449 
floor after I've checked for

programming<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.360> robotic<00:02:13.930> interface<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:15.040> I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
programming the robotic interface then I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
programming the robotic interface then I
can<00:02:15.640> allow<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.180> robot<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.870> run<00:02:17.140> overnight

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
can allow the robot to run overnight

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.460
