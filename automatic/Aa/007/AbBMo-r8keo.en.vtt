microphones on the snare so if you want

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.169 
microphones on the snare so if you want
more<00:00:57.329> rattle<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.839> just<00:00:58.019> dial<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> bottom

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
more rattle you just dial up the bottom

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.450 
more rattle you just dial up the bottom
the<00:01:00.199> ambient<00:01:01.199> microphones<00:01:01.769> can<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.249> moved

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the ambient microphones can be moved

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
the ambient microphones can be moved
back<00:01:02.789> from<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.179> kit<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.050> can<00:01:04.080> change<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
back from the kit and you can change the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.120 
back from the kit and you can change the
stereo<00:01:05.129> spread<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.479> there's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.380> sonic

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
stereo spread so there's a lot of sonic

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.420 
stereo spread so there's a lot of sonic
control<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:09.380> low<00:01:10.380> ticket<00:01:10.560> peace<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.130> simply

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
control there low ticket peace is simply

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
control there low ticket peace is simply
a<00:01:11.490> matter<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> kit<00:01:12.870> loading

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
microphones I also have the ability to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.720 
microphones I also have the ability to
dampen<00:02:12.660> each<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.349> kid<00:02:13.530> pieces<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.549> I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
dampen each of the kid pieces so if I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.330 
dampen each of the kid pieces so if I
want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.599> kit<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:16.680> really

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
want to make the the kit that's really
