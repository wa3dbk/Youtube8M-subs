00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.020
 beers flash water in mg flashes 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.470
 We arrived and I think the country a little more than one 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.340
 year in brazil is a brewery of san 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 diego 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.449
 these guys made collaborative beer 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.930
 here in brazil with assis ones there in porto 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.930
 joyful 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.230
 I'm not sure how much the labels 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.160
 they are bringing more here I have with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 three of them blacks one of them the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 friendship made with the hassan brewery 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:01.859
 It was the Belgian west cost is that it is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.710
 a tripping with 1 point 9 of history 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:12.119
 code black jason the problem in the year 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.880
 past and I found it fantastic even in those 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.190
 bob quick 's blog site site with 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 the best beer of the year I tasted 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.800
 a lot of people thought it was weird taste 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 a lot of people do not cut short and well to hurt 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.959
 the direction here already the dark good coloring 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.239
 foaming nose 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.319
 she has some spice scents that 

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:39.149
 Remember that German sweetie 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:44.060
 I think the effect is a good case. 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.060
 aromatic in the mouth 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.929
 the Chinese toasted toasted hop 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 that he would also like to implement 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:02:02.099
 it's a very complex taste that's left over there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.190
 a light tasty tasty bitter one 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:08.069
 beer that she does not have under it 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.349
 quite complex aroma and flavor 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.330
 but it's an easy beer to drink 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.330
 has 55 points seven of alcohol content 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.709
 Of course, people identify is also a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.760
 little profit 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.760
 together with these partnerships 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.620
 I recommend that I know a lot of people think 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.099
 weird if you taste the weird 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:43.329
 but to my taste is very good 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:46.629
 Let's go to the west goals where the coloring 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.739
 amber hour already strong strong good 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:56.500
 foaming but with a fine 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:59.650
 American beer nose how to jump from 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.030
 American ours did not have to or speak 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:09.480
 america style that I am is very 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 intense with hop in hand 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.470
 zhu or citrus mainly resinous 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:34.000
 bitter intensity enough body is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:37.090
 almost there almost one in 7.341 and want 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:51.090
 Good beer input with enough 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:53.739
 personality and strong flash yellow 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.579
 all good foaming 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.239
 with a slightly creamy persistent 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.239
 blurred 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.420
 despite being a beer of the style 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:14.010
 triple has a very good aroma of hops 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.010
 a little that also reminds almonds 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:28.840
 mild whey a bit less 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.280
 intense than the previous one to whom 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.780
 them to porter this here all 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.639
 Higher code would expect a beer 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 with more body but she does not have is 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.940
 this week more complex more 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.070
 intense taste and even aroma is beer 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.470
 despite having nine percent 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.990
 alcoholic is also easy to drink 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.729
 9.2 Needed a bed with a chestnut 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.139
 also interesting for this style 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.949
 Tribal would normally be expected that he 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:08.590
 it was one of us this sadness but also 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:11.320
 of Belgian yeast good beer in 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.010
 three highly recommend beers 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.690
 with personality and has the others still 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.130
 in flash you need to prove 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.949
 people ask in the episode the people 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.620

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.479

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.310
 I tasted a black vit 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.280
 What do you think of this, do you think it's a 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.060
 is an invention of brewers 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.289
 do you think these styles that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.550
 add the roasted malt without being 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.930
 own style 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.930
 comment and until the next
