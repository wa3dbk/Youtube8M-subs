thing six guns I'm just thinking with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
thing six guns I'm just thinking with
knowledge<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.079> theory<00:00:44.629> what<00:00:45.629> guns

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
knowledge not with theory what guns

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.940 
knowledge not with theory what guns
would<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.860> an<00:00:47.100> invasion<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
would be good for an invasion not really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.200 
would be good for an invasion not really
by<00:00:49.950> uh<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.870> other<00:00:51.870> people's<00:00:52.260> opinions<00:00:52.739> just

just<00:00:54.210> my<00:00:54.329> opinions<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.960> guess<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:56.010> hard<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
just my opinions I guess it's hard to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.479 
just my opinions I guess it's hard to
explain<00:00:56.579> really

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
explain really

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.289

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
a zombie invasion next one another

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.940 
a zombie invasion next one another
shotgun<00:02:45.349> probably<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.440> last<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.769> I'm<00:02:46.860> gonna

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
shotgun probably the last one I'm gonna

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.110 
shotgun probably the last one I'm gonna
show<00:02:47.040> today<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:53.400> sorta<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.060> those

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
show today it's sorta like one of those

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.710 
show today it's sorta like one of those
it's<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.840> think<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.890> shotgun<00:02:56.690> only<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
it's I think like a shotgun only a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.440 
it's I think like a shotgun only a
sawed-off<00:02:58.170> shotgun<00:02:58.350> almost<00:02:59.250> it's<00:03:00.239> pretty

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
sawed-off shotgun almost it's pretty

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.890 
sawed-off shotgun almost it's pretty
cool<00:03:00.630> actually

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
cool actually

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.860 
cool actually
so<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.440> first<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.859> showed<00:03:05.510> which<00:03:06.510> can

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so like the first one I showed which can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.819 
so like the first one I showed which can
find<00:03:07.170> both<00:03:07.590> shots<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.730> instead<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.739> just

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
find both shots but instead of it's just

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
find both shots but instead of it's just
the<00:03:11.040> same<00:03:11.220> thing<00:03:11.250> where<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.420> pull<00:03:12.900> it

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the same thing where you have to pull it

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.330 
the same thing where you have to pull it
back<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.590> push<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:13.890> forward<00:03:15.890> instead<00:03:16.890> oh

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
back and then push it forward instead oh

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.960 
back and then push it forward instead oh
you<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:20.870> get<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> whole<00:03:22.170> line<00:03:22.760> pull<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
you have to get the whole line pull it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.870 
you have to get the whole line pull it
all<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.150> way<00:03:24.239> down<00:03:24.440> push<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.160> then<00:03:26.549> push

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
all the way down push it and then push

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.530 
all the way down push it and then push
it<00:03:26.910> again<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:29.400> very<00:03:29.430> complicated<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.150> still

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.390 

this<00:03:33.540> shotgun<00:03:33.780> would<00:03:34.019> be<00:03:34.109> pretty<00:03:34.380> cool<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
this shotgun would be pretty cool for a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:50.910 
this shotgun would be pretty cool for a
zombie<00:03:36.120> invasion<00:03:37.130> be<00:03:38.130> pretty<00:03:38.400> useful<00:03:38.639> too

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.770 

next<00:03:51.459> one<00:03:52.290> alpha<00:03:53.290> trooper<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:55.540> know<00:03:55.629> why

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
next one alpha trooper I don't know why

she's<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.230> gun<00:03:56.440> but<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.680> think<00:03:56.890> would<00:03:57.010> be<00:03:57.159> a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
she's this gun but I think would be a

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.660 
she's this gun but I think would be a
pretty<00:03:57.430> handy<00:03:58.030> main<00:03:58.989> gun<00:03:59.260> or<00:03:59.409> something

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
pretty handy main gun or something

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:11.149 
pretty handy main gun or something
primary<00:04:00.670> weapon

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.229 

like<00:04:12.159> I<00:04:12.190> said<00:04:12.310> would<00:04:12.549> be<00:04:12.579> pretty<00:04:12.879> good<00:04:13.030> for<00:04:13.180> a

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
like I said would be pretty good for a

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.390 
like I said would be pretty good for a
fire<00:04:13.810> hose<00:04:14.170> thing<00:04:16.739> would<00:04:17.739> be<00:04:17.859> pretty<00:04:18.100> good<00:04:18.250> for

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
fire hose thing would be pretty good for

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.930 
fire hose thing would be pretty good for
a<00:04:18.489> zombie<00:04:18.820> invasion<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.269> guess<00:04:20.370> hey<00:04:21.370> last<00:04:21.669> one

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
a zombie invasion I guess hey last one

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.760 
a zombie invasion I guess hey last one
and<00:04:22.389> probably<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:23.020> what<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.560> heavy

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
and probably like that what the heavy

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.379 
and probably like that what the heavy
duty<00:04:24.010> does<00:04:24.400> heavy<00:04:25.210> duty<00:04:26.050> guns<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> Vulcan

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
duty does heavy duty guns and the Vulcan

or the Stampede I don't care which but
the<00:04:31.960> Vulcans<00:04:32.320> more<00:04:32.560> realistic<00:04:33.570> other<00:04:34.570> than

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
the Vulcans more realistic other than

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.550
