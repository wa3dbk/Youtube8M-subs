00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.130 

almost<00:01:12.580> looks<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.240> disease<00:01:15.120> and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
but this area here it looks like I put

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.070 
but this area here it looks like I put
glue<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:24.340> how<00:01:24.520> rumor<00:01:25.119> younger<00:01:25.630> we<00:01:25.750> will<00:01:25.900> put

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
looks like that the glue is on so it's

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.440 
looks like that the glue is on so it's
real<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:32.140> scaly<00:01:35.910> my<00:01:36.910> forehead

without<00:01:53.290> hurting<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:55.030> almost

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
without hurting and this is almost

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.520 
without hurting and this is almost
almost<00:01:56.110> flat<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.130> something<00:01:57.310> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
almost flat and this is something that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.490 
almost flat and this is something that
has<00:01:59.530> been<00:01:59.560> encapsulated<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:01.500> whatever

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
has been encapsulated so whatever

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.680 
has been encapsulated so whatever
bacteria<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.340> had<00:02:03.659> had<00:02:04.659> here<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:06.659> guess<00:02:07.659> my

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
bacteria that I had had here I guess my

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.900 
bacteria that I had had here I guess my
immune<00:02:08.140> system<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.890> attacked<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.519> pretty

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
immune system just attacked it pretty

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.740 
immune system just attacked it pretty
much<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.640> bacteria<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.420> being

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
much and it's the bacteria is being

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.330 
much and it's the bacteria is being
destroyed<00:02:15.989> day<00:02:16.989> by<00:02:17.170> day<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:17.920> been<00:02:18.130> there

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
destroyed day by day but it's been there

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.860 
destroyed day by day but it's been there
for<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:18.730> while<00:02:18.850> maybe<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.360> almost<00:02:19.660> two

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
for a little while maybe like almost two

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
for a little while maybe like almost two
weeks<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.840> little<00:02:23.080> bump<00:02:23.410> here<00:02:23.530> it's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
weeks so this little bump here it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.789 
weeks so this little bump here it's
still<00:02:24.989> appearing<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.350> still<00:02:26.560> showing

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
still appearing it's still showing

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.580 
still appearing it's still showing
because<00:02:27.280> there's<00:02:27.519> still<00:02:27.910> some<00:02:28.810> pus<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.140> has

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
because there's still some pus that has

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.370 
because there's still some pus that has
to<00:02:29.769> come<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.570> see<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:34.120> um<00:02:34.510> it's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
to come out if you can see but um it's

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.410 
to come out if you can see but um it's
definitely<00:02:36.010> flat<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.970> was<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> put

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
definitely flat like if I was to put

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.850 
definitely flat like if I was to put
makeup<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.140> would<00:02:38.260> never<00:02:38.380> know<00:02:38.530> it's

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
makeup on it you would never know it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.780 
makeup on it you would never know it's
there<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.739> um<00:02:44.130> I'm<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.519> stretch

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
there and so um I'm not going to stretch

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.310 
there and so um I'm not going to stretch
too<00:02:46.030> much<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.540> don't<00:02:46.720> want<00:02:46.780> anything

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
too much because I don't want anything

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.180 
too much because I don't want anything
in<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> pool<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:49.480> ready<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:51.010> have

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
in the pool if it's not ready but I have

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.550 
in the pool if it's not ready but I have

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
can't but it just kind of feels like

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.979 
can't but it just kind of feels like
there's<00:04:08.400> something<00:04:08.669> there<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.060> at<00:04:09.750> first

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
there's something there and at first

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.089 
there's something there and at first
when<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.379> first<00:04:10.650> did<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.669> on<00:04:12.209> Sunday<00:04:13.099> it

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
when I first did it on on Sunday it

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.279 
when I first did it on on Sunday it
wasn't<00:04:14.849> its<00:04:14.970> prominent<00:04:15.480> year<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.139> now

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
wasn't its prominent year but now

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.830 
wasn't its prominent year but now
they're<00:04:16.470> starting<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.829> lift<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.609> also<00:04:18.570> my

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
they're starting to lift up and also my

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.839 
they're starting to lift up and also my
marks<00:04:19.169> here<00:04:19.470> will<00:04:19.769> get<00:04:19.979> darker<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
marks here will get darker and the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.969 
marks here will get darker and the
reason<00:04:21.780> why<00:04:21.870> they<00:04:22.019> keep<00:04:22.199> doctor<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.650> because

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
reason why they keep doctor is because

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.930 
reason why they keep doctor is because
it's<00:04:23.840> all<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.650> melanin<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.250> being<00:04:26.490> pushed<00:04:26.729> up

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
it's all the melanin is being pushed up

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.170 
it's all the melanin is being pushed up
so<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.169> dark<00:04:29.070> hyperpigmentation<00:04:29.760> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
so all of the dark hyperpigmentation is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.960 
so all of the dark hyperpigmentation is
being<00:04:30.389> pushed<00:04:30.630> towards<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.139> surface<00:04:31.349> and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
being pushed towards the surface and

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.520 
being pushed towards the surface and
once<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.150> peels<00:04:33.449> hopefully<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.139> will<00:04:34.199> become

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
once it peels hopefully it will become

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.439 
once it peels hopefully it will become
lighter<00:04:34.770> now<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.639> going<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.970> be<00:04:36.090> crazy

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
lighter now it's not going to be crazy

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.650 
lighter now it's not going to be crazy
lighter<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.289> know<00:04:37.849> because<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.880> want<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.539> do<00:04:39.630> a

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
inhibitors so it has pigment inhibitors

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.850
