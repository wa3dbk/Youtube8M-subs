00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 the eth study week would have you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.990
 the parliament information technology 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 and electrical engineering 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 20 pupils a week 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 long busy with the robot and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.199
 learn how to use electrical engineering like a robot 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 palette 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:39.149
 They hung aua-mother to reggae dance 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:41.640
 and sport powered electrical engineering 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.030
 is in the field of information technology 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 mobility energy technology with 10 technology 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 are examples but electrical engineering is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 barely visible 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.059
 that's why the study week as 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.460
 essential goal of the future 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.840
 students to experience the technology 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.570
 and to look behind the function 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.350
 We give different examples of robotics 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.350
 is one of them 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.110
 the robot very versatile he has two 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.790
 cameras 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.729
 He has a speech recognition 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 object recognition and he can also 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 So there are of course robots 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.000
 who can not move and he is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 very suitable for playing football though 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.509
 we have the here in this week 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 During the study week, many other things 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.549
 tried and also shown and very much 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.060
 had fun with the movements at 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060
 the language recognition 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.840
 The robots program very well 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 she supervises the clinic short talks sgeh 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.009
 between tour are very good she does 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 happy standing experiences are safe with 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:02.030
 robot, we want it for the first time 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.340
 board without and one possibility one 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.580
 really like to do that 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.510
 aware of how much work is on the start of the shoot 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.650
 first moves and back 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.810
 the students have four groups 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.070
 edited smaller projects or the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 last two three days 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.180
 It was enough of a simple movement 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.890
 We ran to the obstacle then 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 little servants respond to the pronunciation 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.160
 and get certain objects or too 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.160
 do gymnastics exercises 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.110
 I have very well imagine 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.820
 the college wants to study us in 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.329
 Nagold the perspective for the future 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.489
 He studied an important goal that you 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.470
 the week is also for the students 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.720
 to gain study and show that 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.130
 in the field of life sciences 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.989
 but also in power engineering and in 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.390
 all other areas here on the topic 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.070
 dementia fascinating possibilities for 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.500
 So the research offers 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.590
 is summarized electrical engineering 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 everywhere and will be everywhere and it is 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.060
 a study for the future
