go ahead and again starting with the
background<00:00:17.010> layer<00:00:17.510> i'm<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.930> ahead

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
background layer i'm going to go ahead

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.169 
background layer i'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:19.260> go<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.769> curves<00:00:20.130> adjustments<00:00:20.820> option

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
and go to the curves adjustments option

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.919 
and go to the curves adjustments option
down<00:00:21.330> here<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> bottom<00:00:21.749> and<00:00:23.900> choosing<00:00:24.900> the

down here at the bottom and choosing the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.169 
down here at the bottom and choosing the
curves<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.669> going<00:00:26.759> to<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.999> is

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
curves and what we're going to do is

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.239 
curves and what we're going to do is
with<00:00:27.810> our<00:00:27.900> previous<00:00:28.140> tutorial<00:00:28.769> we're<00:00:28.949> doing<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
with our previous tutorial we're doing a

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.370 
with our previous tutorial we're doing a
soft<00:00:29.519> light<00:00:29.759> technique<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.449> were<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:31.140> layer

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
soft light technique we were one layer

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
soft light technique we were one layer
with<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> curves<00:00:32.489> adjustment<00:00:32.640> i'm<00:00:33.120> actually

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
with the curves adjustment i'm actually

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.300 
with the curves adjustment i'm actually
to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.630> ahead<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.900> create<00:00:34.230> two<00:00:34.500> adjustment

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
to go ahead and create two adjustment

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.060 
to go ahead and create two adjustment
layers<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.000> technique<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> i'm

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
layers this technique so with this i'm

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.970 
layers this technique so with this i'm
going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.370> ahead<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.850> create<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> dodge

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
going to go ahead and create a dodge

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.970 
going to go ahead and create a dodge
layer<00:00:41.480> again<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:43.199> pushing<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.710> about

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
layer again just pushing it up about

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590 
layer again just pushing it up about
right<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.910> always<00:00:45.059> increase<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
right there you can always increase it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000 
right there you can always increase it
later<00:00:45.809> since<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.530> adjustment<00:00:46.859> layer

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
later since this is an adjustment layer

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
later since this is an adjustment layer
we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.309> always<00:00:47.489> adjust<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.149> we're<00:00:48.780> going

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
we can always adjust it so we're going

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
we can always adjust it so we're going
to<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.079> ahead<00:00:49.109> and<00:00:49.230> click<00:00:49.469> OK<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.859> that<00:00:50.390> going

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to go ahead and click OK to that going

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.919 
to go ahead and click OK to that going
to<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.539> ahead<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:53.210> label<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.420> Dodge<00:00:56.929> okay

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
to go ahead and label this Dodge okay

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.419 
to go ahead and label this Dodge okay
and<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.769> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> go

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
and what I'm going to do is when I go

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.029 
and what I'm going to do is when I go
ahead<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> hold<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.149> control<00:01:00.690> key

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
ahead and hold down my control key

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
ahead and hold down my control key
command<00:01:02.039> key<00:01:02.339> if<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> Mac<00:01:02.969> user<00:01:02.999> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
command key if you're a Mac user and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.110 
command key if you're a Mac user and
then<00:01:04.199> hit<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> i<00:01:04.920> key<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.700> invert

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
then hit the i key and that will invert

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.020 
then hit the i key and that will invert
the<00:01:06.530> adjustment<00:01:07.530> layer<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.189> change

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the adjustment layer so that the change

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
the adjustment layer so that the change
is<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.390> yet<00:01:09.630> applied<00:01:09.950> again<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> point<00:01:11.310> of

it's all done on one layer however the
beauty<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.519> will<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.819> here<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.209> different

moments and again so this is on an

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.089 
moments and again so this is on an
adjustment<00:04:00.569> layer<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:01.110> always<00:04:01.319> paint<00:04:01.860> out

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099

kind of create a type of ignant on the
image<00:04:47.280> which<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.330> paint<00:04:48.660> in<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.870> little<00:04:49.169> bit

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
image which I paint in a little bit

00:04:49.669 --> 00:05:02.040 
image which I paint in a little bit
around<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.819> edges

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.779 

it's<00:05:02.650> more<00:05:02.889> depth<00:05:03.220> into<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> ear<00:05:03.819> here<00:05:07.620> okay

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
it's more depth into the ear here okay

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.070 
it's more depth into the ear here okay
so<00:05:09.789> you<00:05:09.879> can<00:05:10.000> see<00:05:10.180> there's<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.509> shadows<00:05:10.930> on

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
so you can see there's the shadows on

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.050 
so you can see there's the shadows on
the<00:05:11.110> image<00:05:11.409> here's<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.250> highlight<00:05:12.639> again<00:05:12.909> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
the image here's the highlight again the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.399 
the image here's the highlight again the
highlights<00:05:13.360> done<00:05:13.539> effect<00:05:13.840> image<00:05:14.080> at<00:05:14.229> much

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
highlights done effect image at much

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.230 
highlights done effect image at much
hour<00:05:14.680> because<00:05:15.250> there's<00:05:16.210> already<00:05:16.449> quite<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.930> bit

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
hour because there's already quite a bit

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.809 
hour because there's already quite a bit
of<00:05:19.240> highlights<00:05:19.720> already<00:05:20.080> on<00:05:20.229> there<00:05:20.669> now<00:05:21.669> that

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
of highlights already on there now that

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.460 
of highlights already on there now that
we<00:05:21.909> have<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.090> again<00:05:22.629> what<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.139> do<00:05:23.259> if<00:05:23.379> you

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
we have that again what we can do if you

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.809 
we have that again what we can do if you
want<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.710> increase<00:05:24.009> or<00:05:24.849> decrease<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:26.819> effect

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
want to increase or decrease the effect

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.939 
want to increase or decrease the effect
obviously<00:05:28.449> you<00:05:28.509> can't<00:05:28.750> go<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.500> opacity

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
obviously you can't go to the opacity

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.619 
obviously you can't go to the opacity
and<00:05:30.280> do<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.729> way<00:05:30.909> or<00:05:31.120> if<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.360> want<00:05:31.539> to

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:31.629 
and do it that way or if you want to

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.430 
and do it that way or if you want to
change<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.319> point<00:05:33.129> of<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.370> curves<00:05:33.699> just

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
change the point of the curves just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.540 
change the point of the curves just
double<00:05:35.440> click<00:05:35.620> on<00:05:35.770> your<00:05:35.889> adjustment<00:05:36.400> layer

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
double click on your adjustment layer

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.230 
double click on your adjustment layer
here<00:05:37.139> getting<00:05:38.139> decrease<00:05:39.129> as<00:05:39.370> see<00:05:39.940> it'll<00:05:40.150> be

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
here getting decrease as see it'll be

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.730 
here getting decrease as see it'll be
live<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:40.840> have<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.080> preview<00:05:41.469> option<00:05:41.800> checked

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
live you have the preview option checked

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.969 
live you have the preview option checked
again<00:05:44.740> obviously<00:05:45.069> move<00:05:45.819> it<00:05:45.940> up<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.979> the

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
again obviously move it up to the

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.760 
again obviously move it up to the
opposite<00:05:48.430> effect<00:05:49.020> they<00:05:50.020> get<00:05:50.169> I'm<00:05:50.259> looking<00:05:50.560> for

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
opposite effect they get I'm looking for

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.070 
opposite effect they get I'm looking for
more<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.039> a<00:05:51.219> more<00:05:51.400> dramatic<00:05:52.259> type<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:55.270> dodging

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
more of a more dramatic type of dodging

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.550 
more of a more dramatic type of dodging
and<00:05:56.169> burning<00:05:56.229> on<00:05:56.500> this<00:05:56.620> specific<00:05:56.949> niche<00:05:58.560> so

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
and burning on this specific niche so

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.930 
and burning on this specific niche so
right<00:05:59.710> around<00:05:59.800> there<00:06:00.129> will<00:06:00.310> be<00:06:00.370> fine<00:06:00.610> for<00:06:00.819> me

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
right around there will be fine for me

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.700 
right around there will be fine for me
once<00:06:01.750> we<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.050> we're<00:06:02.259> going<00:06:02.379> to<00:06:02.469> go<00:06:02.560> and

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
once we have that we're going to go and

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.920 
once we have that we're going to go and
click<00:06:02.860> OK<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.280> for<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.120> Dodge<00:06:04.360> want<00:06:04.870> to

click OK and for the Dodge want to

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.140 
click OK and for the Dodge want to
increase<00:06:05.199> that<00:06:05.460> that's<00:06:06.460> just<00:06:06.580> if<00:06:06.729> akira's

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
increase that that's just if akira's

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.510 
increase that that's just if akira's
obviously<00:06:07.750> this<00:06:08.680> isn't<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.009> same<00:06:09.219> within

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
obviously this isn't the same within

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.379 
obviously this isn't the same within
this<00:06:09.610> area<00:06:09.789> i'm<00:06:09.940> going<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.120> go<00:06:10.210> ahead<00:06:10.240> and

sits a pretty broad image all together

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.830 
sits a pretty broad image all together
and<00:06:15.099> i'm<00:06:15.310> going<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.490> go<00:06:15.639> ahead<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:15.940> click<00:06:16.449> OK

when<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.139> got<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:17.979> desired<00:06:18.310> results<00:06:19.650> that's

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
when you got the desired results that's

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.219 
when you got the desired results that's
pretty<00:06:20.800> much<00:06:20.919> the<00:06:21.069> gist<00:06:21.460> of<00:06:22.139> dodging<00:06:23.139> and

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
pretty much the gist of dodging and

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.519 
pretty much the gist of dodging and
burning<00:06:23.289> with<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:24.009> curves<00:06:24.460> adjustments<00:06:25.529> and

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
burning with the curves adjustments and

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.830 
burning with the curves adjustments and
again<00:06:26.860> it's<00:06:27.039> a<00:06:27.219> similar<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.419> soft<00:06:28.659> light

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
again it's a similar to the soft light

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.629 
again it's a similar to the soft light
technique<00:06:29.259> however<00:06:29.440> I<00:06:29.740> suggest<00:06:29.979> making<00:06:30.400> the

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
technique however I suggest making the

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.519 
technique however I suggest making the
two<00:06:30.849> obviously<00:06:31.479> the<00:06:31.599> two<00:06:31.750> curves<00:06:31.990> adjustments

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 
two obviously the two curves adjustments

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.529 
two obviously the two curves adjustments
for<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.710> Dodge<00:06:32.889> and<00:06:33.099> burn<00:06:33.159> and<00:06:33.490> again<00:06:34.419> the

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
for the Dodge and burn and again the

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.149 
for the Dodge and burn and again the
beauty<00:06:34.810> of<00:06:34.930> that<00:06:34.990> is<00:06:35.139> you<00:06:35.379> can<00:06:35.560> adjust<00:06:35.710> it

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
beauty of that is you can adjust it

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.860 
beauty of that is you can adjust it
afterwards<00:06:36.789> without<00:06:37.029> having<00:06:37.539> to<00:06:37.599> use<00:06:37.719> your

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
afterwards without having to use your

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.649 
afterwards without having to use your
opacity<00:06:38.430> against<00:06:39.430> it's<00:06:39.639> an<00:06:39.879> adjustment<00:06:40.060> layer

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:40.659 
opacity against it's an adjustment layer

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.920 
opacity against it's an adjustment layer
you<00:06:40.960> can<00:06:40.990> paint<00:06:41.500> in<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:42.490> effect<00:06:42.849> or<00:06:43.090> paint<00:06:43.419> the
