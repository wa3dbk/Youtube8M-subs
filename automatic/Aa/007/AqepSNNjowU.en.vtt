I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.670> many<00:00:59.879> many<00:01:00.090> years<00:01:00.359> ago<00:01:00.570> students<00:01:01.410> who

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I think many many years ago students who

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
I think many many years ago students who
were<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.649> teacher<00:01:01.859> education<00:01:02.309> programs

were in teacher education programs

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
were in teacher education programs
learned<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> teach<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
learned how to kind of teach down the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
middle and do a little here and a little
there<00:01:05.760> well<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.260> right

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
there well we know that that's not right

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
there well we know that that's not right
for<00:01:08.040> children<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:08.640> no<00:01:08.790> such<00:01:09.000> thing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
for children and there's no such thing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
for children and there's no such thing
as<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> regular<00:01:09.750> classroom<00:01:10.220> our<00:01:11.220> school<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> a

as a regular classroom our school is a
microcosm<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> world<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:14.100> work<00:01:14.280> very

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
microcosm of the world so we work very

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 
microcosm of the world so we work very
hard<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.210> sure<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.689> know<00:01:15.840> where

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
hard to make sure that we know where

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
hard to make sure that we know where
children<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.400> don't<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.790> time<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> teach

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
children are we don't take time to teach

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510 
children are we don't take time to teach
things<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:18.960> already<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:20.310> try<00:01:20.490> to

take an inventory of things that they
want<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.260> specifically<00:03:33.829> learn<00:03:34.160> about<00:03:34.430> that

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
want to specifically learn about that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.180 
want to specifically learn about that
country<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.660> not<00:03:35.870> necessarily<00:03:36.440> writing<00:03:36.799> and

country and not necessarily writing and
math<00:03:37.400> yeah<00:03:37.640> that'll<00:03:38.000> be<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.120> great<00:03:38.569> way<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.780> tie

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
math yeah that'll be a great way to tie

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.839 
math yeah that'll be a great way to tie
in<00:03:39.319> when<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.859> use<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> pointer

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
in when you use the pointer

that<00:04:11.620> have<00:04:11.769> as<00:04:12.189> much<00:04:12.430> technology<00:04:12.939> as<00:04:13.329> we<00:04:13.510> do<00:04:13.720> I

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
that have as much technology as we do I

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.560 
that have as much technology as we do I
think<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.560> difference<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.669> at<00:04:16.150> Forest

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
think the difference is that at Forest

Lake<00:04:16.780> we<00:04:17.109> use<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.709> technology<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.609> we

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
Lake we use the technology and we

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.569 
Lake we use the technology and we
maximize<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.709> only<00:04:20.889> way<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.370> that

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
maximize it and the only way to do that

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.510 
maximize it and the only way to do that
is<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:22.030> constantly<00:04:22.479> train<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.099> constantly

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
is to constantly train and to constantly

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.430 
people and be a surgeon or on the doctor
and<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.220> I'm<00:04:51.430> like<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.240> really<00:04:52.659> like<00:04:52.930> NASA

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
and so I'm like what I really like NASA

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.740 
and so I'm like what I really like NASA
and<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.370> I'm<00:04:54.550> thinking<00:04:54.820> about<00:04:54.909> vena<00:04:55.180> de<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.510> want

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750

to<00:04:55.810> be<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> doctor<00:04:56.080> there<00:04:56.550> sometimes<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.789> just<00:04:57.849> go

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
to be a doctor there sometimes I just go

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.640
