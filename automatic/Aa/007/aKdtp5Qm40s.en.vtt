00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.709
 now have some snow this year 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.750
 Every boy dreams of mysterious journeys 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.019
 ten years ago 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.019
 to hold for major damage 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.180
 where are often with bare hands 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 against many creatures 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.930
 when he returns from one of his trips Innsbruck has noticed 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 that his house burned down his wife is dying 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.180
 and his son was kidnapped 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 These bad news confronts what is now the exotic ingredients of a 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.460
 considers him capable and the background behind the robbery 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.560
 fathom 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.220
 However, that can not be run by his home church 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 never runs straight through the ring road so he wants to join soon 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.230
 Captain at the man is willingly bid the adventure available 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.880
 provides 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.400
 with which he the fantasy world also the third the valleys 1b in dangerous 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.540
 Heights explored and foreign 71 billion 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.369
 generally they go 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.369
 Ewald Romain Dumas continues 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.220
 the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.390
 versatile are the tasks that Gugl has to do 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.640
 As with many adventure games, one focus is on ordinary ones 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.080
 Inventory in trend 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.780
 Here you would just have the ingredients for a special battery acid together 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.050
 which is needed for getting into the game 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.860
 In this scene you can see one of the minigames sold with cocaine 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.570
 The goal of this sequence is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.210
 defeating this villain in the dice game which luckily not too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.830
 hard 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.470
 Also, some logical Coraline contains the Game of Difficulty 60 though 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.470
 also here in limits 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.400
 Good day, Mr good day, you want to buy something 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.159
 Cobra found some elements in the RPG York 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.650
 so you can see how to shop in various stores here 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.669
 Selling 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.829
 You can get money, for example, in gambling or by selling 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.499
 captured objects 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.989
 Skill Deposits are an absolute exception and you need them 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.399
 not to be afraid of the switches the traffic I will with option on mostly 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 speaks volumes created 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.970
 another focus 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.939
 and a peculiarity of Google because of the numerous combat deposits 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.219
 with physical or magical attacks 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.199
 you have to pronounce the most different bad guys 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.019
 Healing track 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 otherwise it is about a herb and other objects 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.129
 to protect her life 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.950
 as in role-playing games, character values â€‹â€‹are previously known to the person involved 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.950
 who go about luck and misfortune in combat 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.659
 Since these sequences are turn-based, it does not depend on the 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.590
 Dexterity of the player to his country 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.860
 as it stands for a border on an intelligent strategy 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.919
 since these were on Tanna Kampen game sections where they heaped 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.239
 unfortunately something monotonous 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.590
