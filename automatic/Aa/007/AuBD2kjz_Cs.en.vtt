00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.590

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.900
 difficult political happy because i have him

 Hunt for too much fun here 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.960
 snowy roads you play and on and he 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.910

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.390
 may have for those not yet 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.780
 have seen 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.019
 we are in the volvo v40 cross country 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.610
 that name was emphatically I went 740 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.710
 in that that has to do with that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.720
 Sweden and still want to be with your space 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.479
 keep for a smaller SUV 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.300
 under the xc60 they also said yes themselves 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.000
 the success of range rove level that sets 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.979
 us still thinking well v40 cross 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.380
 country 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.970
 do not actually choose a very separate model 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.899
 you should see it a bit so you have the 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.610
 v40 the normal you have the v40 r-design 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.009
 sportier larger rims other bumpers 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.220
 and have the on the other side of it 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.280
 spectrum girls who v40 cross country 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.450
 you want them higher and 40 mm that is 4 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.210
 centimeters 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.970
 Larger weather also available up to 19 inches 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.490
 other bumpers because yes it's tough 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 brother of the 540 they call the same 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.619
 then but also correct 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.619
 we drive t5 with a wheel drive that is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.590
 not the most relevant versions 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.310
 for the Netherlands but you can 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 have fun on snowy ground 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.209
 j 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 just very tasty about how is it? 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.660
 you but then there was a different route 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.470
 entered where the company secured 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.960
 management systems that continuously intervene 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.720
 no if you have dstc 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.380
 He is going to remain a sport anyway 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 safety marks but that god to the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.310
 rear wheels it is a hot dog systems 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.650
 shit actually spins on its way 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 invite to ion respond as many as five 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
 for generations they all go much faster 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.300
 but he is already much left in the boss 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.520
 stimulate it then you say in normal 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.780
 mode out at the more green though 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.720
 yummy 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.280
 yes that d5 block I'm just 5 cylinder 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.280
 from the blade just fantastic 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.060
 nice power while 54 hp 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.040
 6 So come once come to the 100 video 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.170
 driving strangely enough is slightly slower 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.159
 for 4 seconds in the post and if you 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.170
 own pain whole 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.110
 range of the v40 origin which is the same 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.349
 while it is km per hour 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.450
 only the d2 with manual gearbox 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.030
 it goes slower and that is a variant 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.319
 Netherlands which is fun environment 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.480
 then you probably do 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.970
 because the twin is finished with its addition 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.610
 and on that v40 cross country 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.950
 Is that also you can say yes 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.049
 Just some extra money it costs you may or 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.230
 two two and half thousand euro, have 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.230
 you just with another face and the spring 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.680
 to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.250
 a disadvantage machine still none 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.830
 Flippers that they don't turn it on again 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.410
 coming is also in Sweden 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.110
 he discovered flip air so much 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.090
 finer to self expires easily 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.670
 to be able to choose 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.310
 yes if you still understood advice 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.250
 just go for that t5 old no really 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 a wonderful car I just really there 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.180
 join the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.850
 more than you expected gave birth to full of 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.070
 he's just an upset upset 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.110
 can be beautiful over four wheels 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.520
 to slide 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.320
 if you don't feel like it like me 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.820
 Just create that you just 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.680
 lots of traction you spot and you go 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.120
 can stay nice by stay on the autobahn 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.370
 monterra not t5 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.150
 key is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.150
 a 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.870
 I'm actually wise here 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.490
 the case water itself right 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.910
 digs in the snow I can get it out 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.910
 tracing
