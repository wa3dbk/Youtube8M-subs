00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
couldn't eat this and I'd be much

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.400 
couldn't eat this and I'd be much
happier<00:06:30.700> to<00:06:30.940> see<00:06:31.120> this<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.630> fish<00:06:31.870> grapefruit

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.020 

now<00:06:35.410> Kings<00:06:35.650> are<00:06:35.770> pretty<00:06:35.950> hearty<00:06:36.190> so<00:06:36.550> he's<00:06:36.880> only

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
now Kings are pretty hearty so he's only

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.280 
now Kings are pretty hearty so he's only
been<00:06:37.180> out<00:06:37.240> of<00:06:37.390> the<00:06:37.450> water<00:06:37.600> for<00:06:37.840> maybe<00:06:37.990> a<00:06:38.140> minute

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
been out of the water for maybe a minute

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.110 
been out of the water for maybe a minute
and<00:06:38.500> a<00:06:38.530> half<00:06:38.740> not<00:06:39.010> even<00:06:39.310> so<00:06:39.700> gonna<00:06:39.850> get<00:06:40.000> him

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
and a half not even so gonna get him

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.160 
and a half not even so gonna get him
back<00:06:40.150> in<00:06:40.420> now<00:06:40.570> and<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:40.780> reckon<00:06:40.990> he's<00:06:41.080> gonna
