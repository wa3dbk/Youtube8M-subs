00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.460
 and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.950
 hello good 23 here we are in a new 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.260
 My channel's video is worth 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.390
 and well what are we going to do today this is a 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 tutorial okay and good before you start 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.400
 with the tutorial I want to explain to you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.740
 what the feet 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.059
 has been basically by having the play 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.700
 in order to nourished helmets 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.059
 now I'm recording with the p3 camera 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.059
 OK 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.519
 in this tutorial to raise awareness of how to do 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.739
 an image weigh much less worth 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.180
 so what we have to do is go 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.480
 to photoshop good to do the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.480
 thumbnails or program file 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 over there we go 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.070
 and with 11.5 appearance here more water 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.300
 suppose we are going to save as 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.409
 changed the title so you do not tell me 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.249
 diamonds 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.530
 before and let's see here and we get a 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:29.890
 example 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.920
 and that is very important 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.850
 Of course 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.850
 let's save 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.430
 brave then what we have to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.050
 do 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.050
 we give properties 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.880
 and how do we fix this because those of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.000
 youtube only leave us 2 megabytes as 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:14.300
 march for natural is very simple let's go 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.470
 to the miniature we give April with p 5 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.470
 let's go here to this one 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.330
 and with what I felt southeast we're going to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 save as 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 all the same the format the name all 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.989
 and so 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.990
 we proceed study then we go to the 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.200
 image we go to properties and let's see 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.210
 supposes 138 megabytes and we would already have 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.200
 our image 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.280
 our image and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 what we had done 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.990
 then we would already be and this one is 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.290
 been the tutorial okay so you can 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.290
 do 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:21.730

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.980
 good to tell you what it is I do not know if 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.880
 you will know some 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.530
 a 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.230
 one thing is that what it does is to command 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.390
 signs to the TV 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.770
