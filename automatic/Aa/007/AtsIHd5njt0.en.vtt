October<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.150> year<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.860> wanted<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
October of this year we wanted to make a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.600 
October of this year we wanted to make a
really<00:01:17.850> adjustable<00:01:18.390> frame<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really adjustable frame so that the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.890 
really adjustable frame so that the
racers<00:01:21.000> could<00:01:21.210> tune<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.600> different

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
racers could tune it for different

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
racers could tune it for different
courses<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.560> racing<00:01:23.100> styles<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
courses in racing styles so we have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429 
courses in racing styles so we have
several<00:01:27.090> areas<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.170> change

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
several areas that you can change

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.120 
several areas that you can change
geometry<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.689> suspension<00:01:31.229> command

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
geometry and the suspension command

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.810 
geometry and the suspension command
things<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.170> first<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:35.250> G

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
things like that first off we have our G
