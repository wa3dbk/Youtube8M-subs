but<00:01:49.819> uh<00:01:49.849> I<00:01:50.479> mean<00:01:50.959> I<00:01:51.319> got<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.830> prove<00:01:52.069> myself

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
but uh I mean I got to prove myself

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.339 
but uh I mean I got to prove myself
somehow<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.149> I<00:01:53.179> can<00:01:53.360> get<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.539> ride<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.080> then<00:01:54.229> I

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
somehow so I can get a ride and then I

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.080 
somehow so I can get a ride and then I
can<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.709> flying<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.190> races<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.759> all<00:01:55.849> that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
can be flying to the races and all that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.149 
can be flying to the races and all that
so<00:01:56.420> that's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
so that's

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.399 
so that's
that's<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.909> plan<00:01:58.119> that's<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.600> main<00:01:58.780> goal<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
that's the plan that's the main goal so

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.800 
that's the plan that's the main goal so
eventually<00:01:59.979> we'll<00:02:00.369> get<00:02:00.490> there<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.390> some<00:02:01.689> of
