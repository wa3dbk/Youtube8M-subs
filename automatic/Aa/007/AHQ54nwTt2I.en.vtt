which means and some things about what
it<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.990> things<00:00:22.380> about<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.010> not

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it is things about what it is not

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.109 
it is things about what it is not
anybody<00:00:23.910> starting<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> genre<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.350> also

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
anybody starting a genre and also

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
anybody starting a genre and also
because<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.619> few<00:00:28.619> videos<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:31.369> they

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because a few videos on this and they

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.479 
because a few videos on this and they
all<00:00:32.570> say<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.840> similar<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.250> some

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
all say very similar things but some

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
all say very similar things but some
things<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> sort<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> left<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.960> some

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
things I think I sort of left are some

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.209 
things I think I sort of left are some
things<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.410> made<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:38.040> too

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
things I made a little bit too

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.799 
things I made a little bit too
complicated<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.510> too<00:00:39.660> abstract

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
complicated a little bit too abstract

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
complicated a little bit too abstract
and<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:41.370> no<00:00:41.489> real<00:00:41.790> sort<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> explanation

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and there's no real sort of explanation

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
and there's no real sort of explanation
I'm<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> deal<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.710> mechanics<00:00:44.340> on

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I'm just going to deal with mechanics on

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.529 
I'm just going to deal with mechanics on
one<00:00:45.350> particular<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> doing<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
one particular way of doing it that I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170 
one particular way of doing it that I
see<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> players<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.030> very

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
see in a lot of players a lot of very

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
see in a lot of players a lot of very
very<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.629> players<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:53.059> there<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.210> lots<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
very good players and there are lots of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
very good players and there are lots of
variations<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:55.770> forget<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
variations on this don't forget that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
variations on this don't forget that
there's<00:00:56.430> lots<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.730> lots<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.180> you're<00:00:58.109> going

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there's lots and lots and you're going

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
there's lots and lots and you're going
to<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> find<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.940> you're

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to have to find your way that you're

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.049 
to have to find your way that you're
doing<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.190> start<00:01:02.579> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
doing it but I think a good start is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
doing it but I think a good start is
something<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.719> simple<00:01:04.320> straightforward

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
something very simple straightforward

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020 
something very simple straightforward
it's<00:01:05.820> repetitive<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.549> needs<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's repetitive so it needs to be

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's repetitive so it needs to be
something<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:10.760> ok<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
something you don't think about ok so a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
something you don't think about ok so a
little<00:01:12.930> disclaimer<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.070> saying

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
little disclaimer for me I'm not saying

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.200 
little disclaimer for me I'm not saying
that<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> best<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.520> found

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that I'm the best at this but I found

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.399 
that I'm the best at this but I found
this<00:01:21.390> helps<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:22.020> students<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.080> very

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this helps my students and it's a very

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
this helps my students and it's a very
simple<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> explaining<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.990> okay

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
simple way of explaining you know okay

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:50.260 
simple way of explaining you know okay
some<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:43.009> sorry<00:01:44.009> -<00:01:44.130> six

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:06.210 

three<00:01:51.270> strings<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:52.020> three

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.450 

you<00:02:06.340> shouldn't<00:02:06.610> be<00:02:06.670> here<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:08.400> okay<00:02:09.400> so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
you shouldn't be here that okay so

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.680 
you shouldn't be here that okay so
that's<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.790> cord<00:02:10.000> we're<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.300> be<00:02:10.420> using

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
that's the cord we're going to be using

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's the cord we're going to be using
we're<00:02:10.810> not<00:02:10.900> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.110> be<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.320> song<00:02:12.240> just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
we're not going to be there song just

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.230 
we're not going to be there song just
the<00:02:13.330> mechanics<00:02:13.750> know<00:02:14.410> what<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.070> not<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:16.090> is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
the mechanics know what it is not it is

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:27.830 
the mechanics know what it is not it is
not<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:17.380> often<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:18.340> people<00:02:18.370> kind<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.030> playing

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.050 

got<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.960> bass<00:02:29.170> being<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.970> then

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
got the bass being on the one and then

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.250 
got the bass being on the one and then
they've<00:02:31.180> got<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.420> rest<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> cord<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
they've got the rest of the cord on the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.400 
they've got the rest of the cord on the
two<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.880> not<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.290> it's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
two and it's not it's not like that it's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.620 
two and it's not it's not like that it's
not<00:02:35.500> separated<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.250> that's<00:02:37.180> something

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
not separated like that that's something

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.810 
not separated like that that's something
that<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.230> hear<00:02:38.470> people<00:02:38.500> using<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:39.490> they

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
that you will hear people using but they

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.840 
that you will hear people using but they
will<00:02:40.090> generally<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.770> one<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> soloists<00:02:42.670> in

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
will generally be one of the soloists in

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.490 
will generally be one of the soloists in
the<00:02:43.480> background<00:02:43.960> you'll<00:02:44.110> always<00:02:44.230> have

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the background you'll always have

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.960 
the background you'll always have
someone<00:02:44.740> who's<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.070> playing<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.760> bomb

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
someone who's actually playing that bomb

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.120 
someone who's actually playing that bomb
and<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:49.030> not<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.660> pump<00:02:50.430> okay

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and this is not the pump okay

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.820 
and this is not the pump okay
it's<00:02:54.130> also<00:02:54.340> not<00:02:54.790> not<00:02:55.390> up<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.900> down<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
it's also not not up and down this the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:07.800 
it's also not not up and down this the
main<00:02:57.100> focus<00:02:57.790> of<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.940> also<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.300> totally

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
main focus of it's also not totally

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.229 
main focus of it's also not totally
straight<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.500> not<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.670> machine

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
straight so it's not like a machine

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.990 
straight so it's not like a machine
there<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> difference<00:03:16.750> between<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.760> two

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
there is a difference between the two

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.240 
there is a difference between the two
strikes<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.720> than<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.320> two<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
strikes in it than one in the two in the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.250 
strikes in it than one in the two in the
one<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.330> two<00:03:22.360> three<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.810> fall<00:03:23.020> there<00:03:23.170> are

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
one the two three in the fall there are

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.080 
one the two three in the fall there are
there<00:03:23.410> are<00:03:23.560> there<00:03:23.770> are<00:03:23.890> differences<00:03:24.310> which

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
there are there are differences which

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.760 
there are there are differences which
I'm<00:03:25.209> just<00:03:25.360> going<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> show<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> okay<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.650> it's

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
I'm just going to show you okay but it's

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:37.619 
I'm just going to show you okay but it's
also<00:03:26.920> not<00:03:27.220> messy<00:03:27.730> no<00:03:28.270> it's<00:03:28.450> not

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:47.009 

it's<00:03:38.629> not<00:03:39.379> these<00:03:39.560> long<00:03:40.420> notes<00:03:45.550> clipped<00:03:46.550> short

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
it's not these long notes clipped short

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.440 
it's not these long notes clipped short
this<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.370> important<00:03:49.370> because<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.700> allows<00:03:49.819> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
this is important because it allows the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.720 
this is important because it allows the
grid<00:03:51.379> that<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.620> rhythm<00:03:51.799> player<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.400> provide

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
grid that the rhythm player to provide

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.640 
grid that the rhythm player to provide
enough<00:03:53.060> space<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.780> lead<00:03:53.959> player<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.500> play

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
enough space for the lead player to play

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.339 
enough space for the lead player to play
in<00:03:54.680> between<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.730> for<00:03:56.720> their<00:03:56.840> notes<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.140> ring

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
in between and for their notes to ring

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.360 
in between and for their notes to ring
out<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:57.860> very<00:03:57.890> important<00:04:00.129> so<00:04:01.129> this<00:04:01.250> is

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
out and it's very important so this is

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.800 
out and it's very important so this is
my<00:04:01.549> approach<00:04:01.819> this<00:04:02.030> is<00:04:02.209> something<00:04:02.510> I've<00:04:02.629> seen

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
my approach this is something I've seen

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.250 
my approach this is something I've seen
I<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.260> seems<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.830> be<00:04:03.980> amongst<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:06.400> two<00:04:07.400> just

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
I it seems to be amongst the two just

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.330 
I it seems to be amongst the two just
things<00:04:09.260> I've<00:04:09.410> borrowed<00:04:09.650> from<00:04:09.890> them<00:04:10.160> and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
things I've borrowed from them and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.759 
things I've borrowed from them and
looked<00:04:10.549> at<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.390> I<00:04:11.420> think<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.870> good<00:04:12.440> way<00:04:12.739> of

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
looked at that I think is a good way of

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.610 
looked at that I think is a good way of
communicating<00:04:13.579> this<00:04:13.819> in<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.060> teaching<00:04:14.620> way

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
communicating this in a teaching way

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.449 
communicating this in a teaching way
teaching<00:04:16.579> framework<00:04:18.070> okay<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.130> there<00:04:19.280> are<00:04:19.340> two

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
teaching framework okay so there are two

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.289 
teaching framework okay so there are two
strikes

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
strikes

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.840 
strikes
both<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:21.079> those<00:04:21.169> strikes<00:04:21.560> are<00:04:21.859> down<00:04:22.250> strokes

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
both of those strikes are down strokes

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.640 
both of those strikes are down strokes
they're<00:04:23.060> both<00:04:23.270> down<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:29.139> crushing<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.410> court

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
they're both down and crushing the court

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.790 
they're both down and crushing the court
it's<00:04:30.830> like<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.979> strum<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:32.050> then<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.229> followed

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
it's like a strum and then you followed

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.500 
it's like a strum and then you followed
by<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:33.979> mute<00:04:34.250> both<00:04:34.610> strikes<00:04:34.970> are<00:04:35.150> followed<00:04:35.389> by

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
by the mute both strikes are followed by

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:51.790 
by the mute both strikes are followed by
a<00:04:35.539> mean<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.199> first<00:04:36.440> one<00:04:36.650> is<00:04:36.680> like<00:04:36.919> this<00:04:50.800> is

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
a mean so the first one is like this is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.760 
a mean so the first one is like this is
actually<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.190> strum<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.810> might<00:04:54.020> notice

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
actually a strum and you might notice

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.610 
actually a strum and you might notice
that<00:04:55.190> my<00:04:55.370> right<00:04:55.760> hand<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.150> raised<00:04:58.539> above<00:04:59.539> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that my right hand is raised above the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.640 
that my right hand is raised above the
lowest<00:05:00.620> string<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.360> important<00:05:03.020> then

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
lowest string this is important then

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.140 
lowest string this is important then
this<00:05:03.740> chain<00:05:04.010> refers<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.340> this<00:05:04.639> as<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
this chain refers to this as the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.480 
this chain refers to this as the
trampoline<00:05:06.050> effect<00:05:06.200> it's<00:05:07.010> actually<00:05:07.370> very

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
trampoline effect it's actually very

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.070 
trampoline effect it's actually very
important<00:05:08.120> because<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.479> second<00:05:08.900> stroke

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
important because the second stroke

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.980 
important because the second stroke
itself<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:10.430> little<00:05:10.820> bit<00:05:10.970> more<00:05:11.240> akin<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.599> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
itself is a little bit more akin to the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.930 
itself is a little bit more akin to the
Pete<00:05:12.229> Townsend<00:05:12.620> thing<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.070> just<00:05:13.250> let's<00:05:13.460> do<00:05:13.610> it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
Pete Townsend thing but just let's do it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.150 
Pete Townsend thing but just let's do it
with<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.150> right<00:05:14.270> arm<00:05:14.770> because<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.860> actually

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
with the right arm because you actually

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.390 
with the right arm because you actually
hit<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:17.090> can<00:05:17.240> see<00:05:17.360> only<00:05:17.510> mute<00:05:19.539> okay<00:05:21.310> now<00:05:22.310> on

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
hit it you can see only mute okay now on

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.159 
hit it you can see only mute okay now on
the<00:05:22.430> second<00:05:22.910> strike<00:05:23.180> there's<00:05:23.510> something<00:05:23.900> else

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
the second strike there's something else

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.839 
the second strike there's something else
that<00:05:24.380> happens<00:05:24.950> or<00:05:25.130> something<00:05:25.160> else<00:05:25.610> that

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
that happens or something else that

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:33.580 
that happens or something else that
follows<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.740> stroke<00:05:30.580> on<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:32.660> second<00:05:33.110> strike

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
follows the stroke on the second strike

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.779 
follows the stroke on the second strike
however<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:35.090> next<00:05:35.240> thing<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:35.510> happens<00:05:36.789> is

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
however the next thing that happens is

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.409 
however the next thing that happens is
that<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.000> reset<00:05:38.510> your<00:05:38.630> plectrum<00:05:40.090> now<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.270> is

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
that you reset your plectrum now this is

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.930 
that you reset your plectrum now this is
a<00:05:41.450> mechanical<00:05:42.219> movement<00:05:43.219> this<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.430> something

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
a mechanical movement this is something

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.390 
a mechanical movement this is something
to<00:05:44.150> train<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.169> won't<00:05:45.409> see<00:05:45.680> me<00:05:45.919> or<00:05:46.219> anyone

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
to train you you won't see me or anyone

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.550 
to train you you won't see me or anyone
really<00:05:46.700> doing

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
really doing

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.230 
really doing
consciously<00:05:48.560> sticking<00:05:49.039> it<00:05:49.159> back<00:05:49.189> on<00:05:49.580> the

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
consciously sticking it back on the

00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:00.629 
consciously sticking it back on the
point<00:05:50.449> is<00:05:50.659> that<00:05:51.020> I<00:05:51.550> think<00:05:52.550> it's<00:05:53.060> important<00:05:54.400> to

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:45.429 

listen<00:06:01.639> to<00:06:01.819> the<00:06:09.250> again<00:06:42.490> okay<00:06:43.539> so<00:06:44.539> that's<00:06:44.750> the

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
listen to the again okay so that's the

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.040 
listen to the again okay so that's the
basic<00:06:46.099> thing<00:06:46.129> practice<00:06:46.819> it<00:06:46.969> over<00:06:47.090> again<00:06:47.360> use<00:06:47.870> a

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
basic thing practice it over again use a

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.439 
basic thing practice it over again use a
metronome<00:06:48.529> and<00:06:48.919> I<00:06:48.979> suggest<00:06:49.400> putting<00:06:49.639> it<00:06:49.909> so

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
metronome and I suggest putting it so
