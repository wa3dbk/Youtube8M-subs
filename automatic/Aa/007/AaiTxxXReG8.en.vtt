00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.309
 so end the final decline for the post of vice 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.719
 premiere 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.419
 the Poles are called again 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.439
 faith sense of hay who agreed 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.579
 tell about what happened but 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.900
 too cardinale tell 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.820
 Well, for starters, that it is a common story 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.220
 today you can go deep 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.180
 pan because alnas was very 2 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779
 tense matches with csna and finns 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.719
 when I want to point out that the beginning of the grid we 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.780
 should have played really 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.570
 but with the Poles 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.710
 offer the actors they are with the Finns 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.510
 but for some reason again on the last day 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.890
 the organizers decided 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 Well, as here or otherwise, those who do something about 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.280
 more correctly, I did not write such a horse 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 in advance of the championship 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 but in the end we are the place to play with 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.640
 the Poles are playing with the Finns 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.060
 if you take that match 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.260
 pretty cool game 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 n we showed it very well so he 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 letting go true then some problem 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.870
 were behind the control of fat when you take 314 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.500
 this one or two rounds 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.870
 you can take but what we did 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.790
 very happy that we finally like this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.290
 a command that was dropped a little from heaven 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.230
 to the ground 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.740
 Yes, and glad that regularly pursued tournaments 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.160
 where we finally played with them is not a decree 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 Yes, our kind of normal map 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.940
 but for now, again, if you take the goal bills 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.020
 the weight of the Assad there will again be a bunch of these new 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 smoking cards will surely be by 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.960
 tours though the principle if it is not on tours 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.840
 there will be legs too and because 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.700
 it will be possible to cross out about one 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 video cards 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530
 percent 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.710
 projects for currency and three questions in total 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.660
 even ceiling height 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.800
 put together a list as often asked 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.500
 vacations and warmth from the final we approached and 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 nip and know responsibly 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.210
 how the poles play what they do 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.369
 On a thought we were a little tired because 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.870
 cut off d 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.240
 the Poles were a little bit 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.250
 so a little bit easier because there wasn’t 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.970
 just one game with the second team 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 polish and sure enough not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.429
 were selected and immediately sat on the final 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.799
 played two children zhola collects 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.209
 which ones approached the final a bit 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.969
 tired plus we moved to a new one 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.720
 monitor and this is huge 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.379
 7 inch power 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.549
 agree monitor owls and how would we 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.609
 it was not at all familiar to them immediately 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.489
 but that's really not the point 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.259
 I would like to mark or 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.949
 great as a game 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.229
 Poles also mention the pelvic series 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.949
 who broke a little of their own 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.289
 shouts but also encouraged 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.299
 Polish public following what principle 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.849
 the protodeacon didn’t have to shout much 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.819
 they are all behind her to do all the Polish public 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.859
 regnum 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.719
 Cochina shot down it was all like 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.419
 football game just you sit 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.119
 such cries are not screw reel not from parents 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.319
 demoralizing in general or just something not 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.579
 can normally play with the fact that 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 Can not hear anything 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.709
 I don't care at all 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.499
 demobilized but on the growth shield is unreal 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.450
 play plan 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.519
 I even had thoughts while playing 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.719
 i just turn the music on and loud 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.840
 connection and just and fly but it was necessary 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.769
 such transactions probably just did not stop 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.730
 what then I can not see but also to hear 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.219
 infu their 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.709
 the whole team which 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.239
 inside of our house since we played congestion 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.529
 already like 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.619
 just fly but think 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.749
 she called turn on the music 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.039
 in the time record, our team will win 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.759
 but we can say that they have come a showdown 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.709
 especially home tournament 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.659
 previously, many fans also became 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.919
 doubt no less here you are here we are 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.329
 beat said or second place that in 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.459
 Overall, the final is not bad 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.290
 percent 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.209
 what kind of society is this tournament for country 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 helped u your internal come back 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.179
 in itself 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.959
 ha he can't help you because we 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.379
 the necklace itself is actually nothing 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.839
 terrible did not happen we 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.749
 did not play very well but 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:51.810
 played well 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.900
 Centenary period with Andrei steel theme 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.590
 again i want to say something now 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.850
 these places were taken just because 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.990
 in the process the topic of carrying us was 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.930
 not very comfortable we played the most 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.159
 strong card 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.360
 we estimate who 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.019
 in my mouth a strong team of the world and how would 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.829
 so if you could not beat them 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.129
 Mr. Mr. But even 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.590
 but pavel in ukrainian 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.689
 qualifying this third place 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:15.889
 d like 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.909
 a little demonized us but 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.919
 here is this tournament 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.519
 features we won it all 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.690
 returned her circle 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.900
 the cup of course I think, too, Marada that is, we 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.440
 understand that princeton builder 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.290
 bad form yes and we still such enters 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.770
 world top gang send it very 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.270
 nicely 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.460
 how diving whose tournament but we 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.069
 intend to 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.080
 yes tournament excellent 300 schedule is quite good 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.240
 Ditsi on what it would like probably 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.479
 more matches of the day such we probably 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.960
 only played june 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.919
 Cube Georgian team did not come a 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.009
 first day there are two matches then 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.839
 the percentage in the show more laptops is one 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.520
 A map of everything, is it today at once? 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.370
 really that is for us as a team 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.199
 n very wrong was the distribution 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.540
 games because the first day of the mission me 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.150
 The second day was not played at all. 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.540
 all this money was very loud 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.510
 from tuberculosis but we are not going to say right now 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.139
 then he did not ask yet a coward and 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.360
 final finality 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360
 usually 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.669
 meticulous svetlana lashchenov new rally 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.460
 the building is just there before the river 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.389
 microsoft tries 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.740
 this self-portrait present yourself new 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.279
 routes as a result of new fares 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.869
 ahead with the assessment of the measures ask and not 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:31.529
 demanded warped often operetta 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.259
 leasing world crises something 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.770
 will change 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.669
 but now the coach of the stains principle we 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.509
 from the diagram we are with me chichas sometimes principle 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.729
 do you think comments that she play more 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:42.849
 but to train on 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.400
 in fact, we have a debugged scheme 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.270
 enough such we train assessments 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.860
 lanin but not more than seven days five and even 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.310
 before that, I am normally preparing for boarding 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.339
 strategies 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:55.800
 because really 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.499
 but like a huge family 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.289
 percentage and very hard in Russia friend 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.039
 a friend is more than five days there we will fix 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.770
 Kito 43 kiev str begins 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.610
 however a little not the age of 17 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.199
 tons of 17 light is just rave 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.650
 competition for the topic just sit in 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.410
 stories that 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.240
 Well, and the domestic problems are different 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.720
 there are but very hard shorter but they 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.810
 play the goods sold summarize 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.039
 I happen often 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.889
 order and sacrifice all read comments on 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:22.800
 sites 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.919
 her decency is only an expert 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.009
 leave them 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.949
 sometimes just out of what could be 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.099
 people 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.469
 the new dome does not catch them and the eternal 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.360
 from Iran to Egypt you passed the cuprina 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.009
 I do not understand that they relate their growth 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.020
 positions for sure say yes you can number 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.979
 troupe report about anxious kozuka 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:39.830
 Mutarik print 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.560
 questions when can eat only when you 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.439
 at least explain to the fans and just 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.879
 people who pace watching you and 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.550
 which probably is not easy yet 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.999
 understand I really don't know correctly understand 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.899
 but also for science 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.949
 really hard chance to say anything 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.819
 There really are a lot of these and 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.509
 incomprehensible comments thousand tons 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:06:59.719
 well here tsuma 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.419
 I do not know what to say that is raw 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.520
 increased and royal would 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.699
 tons of people 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.469
 uah who self gulf this is basically 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.599
 so schoolchildren eleventh grade 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.079
 tenth but there are older keys plus these 

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.860
 guys except 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.259
 they read their books with a book 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.259
 living together
