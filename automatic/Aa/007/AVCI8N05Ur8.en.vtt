00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.650 

everything<00:03:14.570> works<00:03:15.970> quite<00:03:16.970> beautifully<00:03:17.450> too

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
everything works quite beautifully too

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:32.000 
everything works quite beautifully too
except<00:03:18.200> for<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.560> camera<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:22.070> email<00:03:22.670> work

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:43.270 

where<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.849> Rope<00:03:33.030> estudio<00:03:33.599> music<00:03:35.689> messaging

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.300 

so<00:03:44.280> they<00:03:44.459> all<00:03:44.579> probably<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.060> camera<00:03:46.159> it's<00:03:47.159> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
so they all probably the camera it's a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.009 
so they all probably the camera it's a
bit<00:03:48.000> glitchy<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.150> see<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
bit glitchy as you can see so the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.630 
bit glitchy as you can see so the
preview<00:03:52.440> doesn't<00:03:52.829> work<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.099> if<00:03:53.159> I<00:03:53.370> take<00:03:53.610> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
preview doesn't work what if I take a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.809
