00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 a greeting from ivan paparelle ben 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.819
 found on the youtube channel of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 mobile magazine 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 today I propose a sort of update of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.240
 a review that we have already proposed 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 a few days ago I'm talking about go 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.980
 clever quantum 400 we have today 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 available in its variant 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.539
 called plus what changes respect 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 to the normal version 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 we see it immediately there was a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 quite important enhancement 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 I would say significant of the department of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.990
 multimedia because why the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.790
 camera also in the normal version 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.890
 and from 2 thousand pixels passes to here we are at 5 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 megapixel with autofocus then a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.969
 improvement even quite clear 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.680
 as well as the level of fiction also 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.989
 just of the correct focus 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.280
 5 megapixel image at point with 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.350
 autofocus and while in the video 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.520
 we move from the vga to the availability of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 720p therefore also in this case a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.539
 most defined video that has in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 definitive also results particularly 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.700
 it is more fluid in addition to this 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.350
 short video I wanted to show you some 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 other detail while I remind you that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.939
 among the main features of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 how much a 400 v go clever is that of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.909
 support dual sim with the system 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.530
 dual sim full hd then with the two numbers 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.270
 always active I refer you naturally 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 to the review we have already made of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.240
 as much as a 400 for all the various 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 specific 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 I also have this time available 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.740
 I'll show you the flip cover also 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.450
 the boxes of the two versions the first one is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 just what is called color 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 concept that is what we already have 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.530
 tried also on the other occasion but 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 now in a plus version that stands out 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.180
 for a large number of accessories 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 we have colored covers and bumpers 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.240
 colored even the possibility of 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.130
 replace the part color 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 front of the phone with dials 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.659
 all preformed adhesive films 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 these accessories found inside this one 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.380
 box included in the purchase price 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.079
 if you decide to opt for the version 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.009
 color concept if you need instead 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.069
 of a qu 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.480
 let's call it more normal 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.400
 avoid taking it color concept e 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.819
 buy the normal version save 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.989
 for a few euros but you have a budget 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.730
 absolutely more normal than typically 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.299
 smartphone without the accessories I have 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.920
 also showed go clever puts us 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.260
 this accessory is also available 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.079
 also in an accessory to buy 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.329
 to buy apart what a clip is 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.170
 cover of course perfectly 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.900
 preformed rubberized material indeed 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.819
 very nice because you hold it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 heartily and I would say that the mutants 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.549
 rather resistant protects the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.970
 phone even from somewhere 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.489
 usage not not exactly orthodox 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.530
 so you can also use it for 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.849
 put it smartphone in feet then 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.190
 when we want 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.170
 for example, I ca n't see any videos 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.909
 we want to consult the internet even 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.440
 some documents then another 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.659
 very useful accessory that you can 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.209
 use in support of the go clever 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.579
 as much as a 400 I stop here then for 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.810
 this short update video 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.150
 of the review we already have 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.949
 proposed a few days ago and I refer you 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.949
 the next tests a greeting from the brands
