see that one blade of grass and two feet

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.090 
see that one blade of grass and two feet
of<00:02:30.240> root<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.860> two<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> half

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
of root this time it's two and a half

three inches deep

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.170 
three inches deep
I've<00:02:40.080> seen<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.560> six<00:02:40.800> inches<00:02:41.070> deep<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
I've seen it up to six inches deep and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.930 
I've seen it up to six inches deep and
when<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> soil<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.870> dry<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:44.370> impossible<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
when the soil is dry it's impossible to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.000 
when the soil is dry it's impossible to
get<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:49.400> good<00:02:50.400> time<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.850> them<00:02:51.000> out<00:02:51.120> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
get out good time to get them out I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.980 
get out good time to get them out I
think<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> gonna<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:54.440> constant<00:02:55.440> fight
