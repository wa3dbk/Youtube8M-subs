00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.449
 despite the network viewer friend 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.410
 how much greater is with great joy 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.900
 back 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.590
 initiated but the program comes from the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.570
 TV 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.470
 continuing the study of the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.109
 Words are asking with a lot of people. 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.380
 We are going to speak a word today that I 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.050
 I consider it so fantastic because Jesus 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.120
 was politically and socially complete in her 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 spiritually complete in this 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.510
 parable is called the parable of the good 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.780
 Samaritan is told in the gospel of 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:53.900
 lucas chapter 10 verse 25 to 37 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 is a parable that Jesus tells with this 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:06.140
 narrates in the temple and from Lucas 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.820
 He raised his doctorate and law to a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 Jesus approves master that I will do 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.800
 inherit eternal life that is written in the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.020
 Torah asks Jesus what with the good Jew 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.970
 the Jews do not answer everything that you 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.110
 question you have to show and prove 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.940
 that you know what it is 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.860
 asking him he asks what is 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.290
 written in the story they amadeus about 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.750
 all the things with all your heart of 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.150
 your whole soul is your neighbor as the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.310
 Jesus himself responds to him 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.890
 respond correctly phase this and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.760
 you will live first strong teaching 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.040
 because if Jesus was talking to 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.680
 he was alive 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.380
 jesus tells him to live the stages ti will live 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.720
 means that he who does not love the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 close does not do God's will 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.180
 all your heart with all your soul 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.580
 still spiritually dead alive 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.989
 physically but spiritually 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.140
 dead was the case of that of the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.129
 self-knowledge with culture but not 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.239
 had 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:20.239
 I was not even doing the most 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.030
 important to love God who is your 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.900
 next 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.050
 the doctor of the law to justify himself 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.180
 asks Jesus and who is my neighbor and 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.230
 people have to ask why 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.820
 doubt 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.580
 What did the whole law do not know? 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480
 who was next to him because he is not 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.440
 White 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 this next word that is written with 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 three letters resch ign 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.150
 I miss these three words. 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.360
 mean next next stay pastor 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.070
 that the same radical flight and e can 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 mean evil then as Hebrew yesterday 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.680
 and is also inscribed 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.550
 three for the three letters means 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.950
 next pastor is bad because 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.500
 would love to have one who has do 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.940
 evil as yourself that is to love what you do 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.920
 well jesus said the Pharisees love the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.720
 Pagan also love without distinction 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.680
 they like their families their 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.890
 friends 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.590
 difficult to speak the enemy 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.160
 that is the question why he 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.470
 asked the doctor of the law question 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.670
 proceeds from the point of view how do I 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.400
 would say linguistic lexicon 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.980
 he could have doubts about either the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.989
 its next would be the pastor who 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.120
 I shared with him what is most 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.670
 near him or what he does wrong 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.970
 jesus to take the doubt begins to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.340
 tell the following story name down 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.360
 from jerusalem to jericho 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.989
 now why he went down when he went down 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.000
 of the temple where the cell was 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.040
 of the spirituality of that time 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.350
 from the temple of jerusalem to 736 meters 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.669
 above sea level and with jerry koff 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.669
 stands 400 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:29.390
 then Jesus sees a distance of 1,136 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:32.330
 meters from jerusalem jericho 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.330
 away from God the old home is bete 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.180
 gets down 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.590
 and he was 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.780
 did geographically down 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.370
 when we should from the point of view 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.280
 even physical climb jesus places here a 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.520
 principle of Judaism called there like that. 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.500
 get climb up to god like bass 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.039
 climbed the mountain to receive the 10 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.750
 abraham rose the hill 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.719
 exactly where is the temple for 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.210
 Your child 's exact sacrifice is l 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.250
 Mount Carmel 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.240
 jesus climbed the hill of olive trees rose 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.029
 the taboo then to a concept 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.550
 spirit of the ascent for God and that 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.949
 man down so he second jesus 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.639
 was when that jerusalem Jericho was 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.860
 attacked by thieves who stole everything 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.250
 that we had torn his robe and 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:40.909
 left half-dead on the road 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:43.490
 I see that Jesus put it geographically 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.219
 the problem 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:52.400
 he who departs from God who 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:53.719
 escapes from the tuning with the high can fall in 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.020
 difficulty 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:59.360
 this teaching of Jesus is fantastic and 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.270
 also serves us today 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.310
 he will speak helped at that time but we 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.360
 we know that there is harmony with 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.089
 God 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.789
 so spiritual tony is a point 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.680
 important in our lives that the 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.729
 people need to tune in to the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.979
 spirituality does not lower this 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.349
 tune and become capable of 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.080
 remarks lower spirits we 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.120
 we are antennas like beccar dialing 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.159
 tune with us if we lower this 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.469
 vibration 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:34.219
 logically we are passive of having 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:37.430
 problems of obsession and this first 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:39.979
 this by collation placement jesus is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.940
 fantastic in this sense it creates a 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:46.790
 geographical framework is spiritual and 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.370
 material that we are going to continue in Ram 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.070
 in the second part of our program not 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.490
 that's where we'll be back in a 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.490
 minute
