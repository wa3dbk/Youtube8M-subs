and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.609> didn't<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.180> back<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.870> white<00:01:04.049> thing

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and I didn't go back to the white thing

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
and I didn't go back to the white thing
again<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.339> inconsistent<00:01:05.850> going

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
again so it's very inconsistent going

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
again so it's very inconsistent going
back<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> forth<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.880> I'm<00:01:08.880> not

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
back and forth like this and I'm not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
back and forth like this and I'm not
sure<00:01:09.210> exactly<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> bug<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
sure exactly like what the bug is I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.010 
sure exactly like what the bug is I
think<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.610> with

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
think it's like something to do with

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.490 
think it's like something to do with
they're<00:01:13.020> transitioning<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:14.159> G<00:01:14.549> cough<00:01:14.790> tools

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
they're transitioning from G cough tools

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
they're transitioning from G cough tools
to<00:01:16.850> decomp<00:01:17.850> tools<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.390> something<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to decomp tools or something that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
to decomp tools or something that
whatever<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.420> reason<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
whatever the reason is this is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
whatever the reason is this is
how<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:24.060> fix<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.290> maybe<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
how you would fix it or maybe a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.190 
how you would fix it or maybe a
workaround<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:27.600> let's<00:01:27.780> change<00:01:27.900> back

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
workaround to it but let's change back

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800 
workaround to it but let's change back
to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.829> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> use<00:01:29.340> here

what the bug is but it does exist and

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.710 
what the bug is but it does exist and
that's<00:05:41.300> how<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.479> would<00:05:41.780> work<00:05:42.620> around<00:05:42.949> that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
that's how you would work around that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.119 
that's how you would work around that
anyways<00:05:44.720> that's<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.050> for<00:05:45.139> this<00:05:45.320> one
