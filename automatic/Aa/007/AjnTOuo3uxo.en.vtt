help to project the sound of a string
vibration<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.620> resonates<00:01:03.129> through<00:01:03.489> the

acoustic guitar the sound hole is often

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.810 
acoustic guitar the sound hole is often
larger<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.680> more<00:01:08.800> predominant<00:01:09.460> because

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
larger and more predominant because

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.940 
larger and more predominant because
natural<00:01:10.450> resonance<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.110> often<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.470> only<00:01:11.500> way

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
natural resonance is often the only way

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.220 
natural resonance is often the only way
the<00:01:12.520> sound<00:01:12.760> of<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.970> string<00:01:13.030> vibration<00:01:13.630> gets

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
the sound of the string vibration gets

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.969 
the sound of the string vibration gets
from<00:01:14.590> here<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.160> your<00:01:15.310> ears<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:17.229> jazz<00:01:17.470> guitarist

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
from here to your ears in jazz guitarist

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.300 
from here to your ears in jazz guitarist
you<00:01:18.640> will<00:01:18.850> also<00:01:19.119> see<00:01:19.450> usually<00:01:20.229> one<00:01:20.680> or<00:01:20.920> two

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
you will also see usually one or two

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.730 
you will also see usually one or two
pickups<00:01:21.850> these<00:01:22.540> pickups<00:01:22.990> actually<00:01:23.439> help<00:01:23.650> to

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
pickups these pickups actually help to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.700 
pickups these pickups actually help to
pick<00:01:24.100> up<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:25.180> vibration<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.960> these<00:01:26.350> strings

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
pick up the vibration of these strings

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.819 
pick up the vibration of these strings
and<00:01:26.979> transfer<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.490> out<00:01:27.790> your<00:01:28.750> output<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.740> an

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
and transfer it out your output to an

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.800 
and transfer it out your output to an
amplifier<00:01:30.009> now<00:01:30.970> you're<00:01:31.090> probably<00:01:31.240> wondering

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
amplifier now you're probably wondering

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.859 
amplifier now you're probably wondering
why<00:01:32.439> have<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.740> resonating<00:01:33.280> top<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.909> projecting

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
why have a resonating top and projecting

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.289 
why have a resonating top and projecting
sound<00:01:35.170> holes<00:01:35.409> when<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.729> vibration<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
sound holes when the vibration of the

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.389 
sound holes when the vibration of the
string<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.600> just<00:01:37.810> going<00:01:38.049> out<00:01:38.229> your<00:01:38.979> pick<00:01:39.250> up

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
string is just going out your pick up

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.600 
string is just going out your pick up
here<00:01:39.579> out<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.880> an<00:01:39.970> amplifier<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
here out to an amplifier well the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.929 
here out to an amplifier well the
resonating<00:01:43.149> body<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.840> these<00:01:44.500> guitars

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
resonating body of these guitars

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.910 
resonating body of these guitars
actually<00:01:45.939> helped<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.450> give<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:47.259> way<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
actually helped to give the way the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.490 
actually helped to give the way the
string<00:01:48.219> vibrates<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.939> subtle<00:01:49.719> character<00:01:50.020> or

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
string vibrates a subtle character or

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.240 
string vibrates a subtle character or
tone<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.820> tone<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.390> actually<00:01:53.250> captured

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
tone so this tone is actually captured

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.490 
tone so this tone is actually captured
by<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.460> pickup<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.090> sent<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.409> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
by the pickup and sent out to the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.920 
by the pickup and sent out to the
amplifier<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:58.119> important<00:01:58.600> thing<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.780> note

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
amplifier one important thing to note

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.279 
amplifier one important thing to note
about<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.590> widebody<00:02:00.039> jazz<00:02:00.939> guitar<00:02:01.329> is<00:02:01.509> that

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
about the widebody jazz guitar is that

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.950 
about the widebody jazz guitar is that
with<00:02:02.560> such<00:02:02.829> broad<00:02:03.219> resonating<00:02:04.149> surfaces<00:02:04.689> in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
with such broad resonating surfaces in

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350 
with such broad resonating surfaces in
such<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> thick<00:02:05.590> pocket<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.100> air<00:02:06.369> inside<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.240> it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
such a thick pocket of air inside of it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400 
such a thick pocket of air inside of it
it<00:02:08.259> often<00:02:08.440> falls<00:02:08.860> prey<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.190> feedback<00:02:09.700> problems

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it often falls prey to feedback problems

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.500 
it often falls prey to feedback problems
so<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.500> usually<00:02:11.830> see<00:02:12.250> these<00:02:12.460> guitars<00:02:12.700> used<00:02:13.240> in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
so you usually see these guitars used in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
so you usually see these guitars used in
small<00:02:13.900> combo<00:02:14.230> settings<00:02:14.770> or<00:02:14.950> solo<00:02:15.550> jazz<00:02:15.790> guitar
