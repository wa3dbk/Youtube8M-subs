00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.020
in today's world we need all these
different things to graduate and so

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.660
like being at St. Edward's I wasn't really expecting to get all

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.719
the special things that were thrown at
me such as the you need to do

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.420
research before you graduate you need to be
published like you need

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.330
you need to have an internship in
the field and it was an

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.380
amazing thing to come and see that the
people at the school were so

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.170
involved in my career and building my career

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.800
the service break experiences are

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.410
definitely unique to St. Edward's I
know that other schools may have you know

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.020
similar programs but I think that the
way that Campus Ministry structures it

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.329
is so that you go into this with 
like as they say an open mind and open heart

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.090
to learn

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.960
a lot from the people that you'll  be
working with wherever you go I've

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.550
had like a lot of amazing experiences at St. Edward's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
for me one that  keeps repeating is the sense of community

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.520
is that it can find amazing friends here
friends from

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.590
the US and from abroad I have a lot of
friends from

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.629
Asia from Africa from South America you
can just have friends from

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.260
everywhere around the world well I studied
abroad in Poland I was in a Polish

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.939
University for a whole semester

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.290
and it really gave me the opportunity to
learn with students outside of the United

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.970
States

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.760
and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.930
witness new cultures and traditions
and after that I traveled to 12 different

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.470
countries and kind of had an adventure of
a lifetime

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.830
the spring I'm going on an international
immersion trip to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.850
Banglore India and I'm so excited sometimes words don't even measure up to how

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.960
excited I am

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.800
it's also a chance to go do something I love
to do which is to serve other people

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.060
the college experience really is more
geared around people you surround

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.160
yourself with and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.410
and the study that you do when you're
here I'm really lucky that I ended up

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.980
going to school here because it would've
been very very easy for me to get lost

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.400
in the cracks at a bigger school I love my
professors they're really passionate about

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.060
what they're teaching and they really
encourage us to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.820
take risks in the classroom and really
talk about things that we want to talk

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.790
about and kind of

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.780
help facilitate our own ideas I'm really
excited about my future

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.190
I think at St. Edward's I have a lot of
help from professors and from staff

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.340
to lead me to the goal of being
whoever I want to be and whatever I want

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.770
to be and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.290
wherever I want to be I'm very excited about
my future and I feel

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.709
prepared for life after college
