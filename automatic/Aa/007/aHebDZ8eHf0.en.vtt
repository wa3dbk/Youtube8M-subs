00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.610
 hello how are you welcome to this new 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.400
 tutorials today claudia and today we are going to them 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.560
 I will teach how to make the color change 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:15.490
 in the hair we started this is our 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.490
 our background layer is going to double 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 control j to duplicate 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.050
 once having it if you look at 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.210
 this part that the black color is on 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 white and the bottom is a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.910
 button that will be to activate the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 fast mask once having it so 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.530
 we are going to take a brush and go to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 start to pass on the hair that in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.910
 this case is what we are going to change from 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910
 colour 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.079
 and in this way we are going to fill 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.079
 all the part that we want to select 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.890
 once we have selected what 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:09.259
 what is the hair we're going 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.659
 again the quick mask button and if 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.380
 we will make a selection we are going to 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.180
 selection and invest 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.969
 and we have selected what is the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.520
 hair only in the part of here 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.590
 down we're going to open and we're going to look 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.840
 color balance is going to open us 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.870
 here an eyelash and this is where we're going to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.480
 keep changing the color 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.130
 of the hair and you can go playing 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.090
 with the tonalities depending on the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.090
 needs that have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.150
 you are giving the tone 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.990
 in the part of up here they are going to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.880
 change the shadows and we're also going 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.570
 moving the parameters to give 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.119
 opacity brightness to the image ok 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.310
 you are moving here I repeat 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.810
 depending on the needs that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.360
 have 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.580
 in this case we will also change 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.780
 the tone to the eyebrows then we're going to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.730
 duplicate the control layer j to duplicate 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 and let's do the same thing we're going to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 this part of here we see that black 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.130
 this on the target and if we activate the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.600
 fast mask the brush we already have it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.370
 I'll lose a little size 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.370
 that covers me exactly what I need 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.879
 and I pass it over my eyebrows this is for 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 also change the tone in the eyebrows and 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.709
 obviously I will not shake the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.840
 image once we have it already 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.220
 we remove the quick mask button 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.720
 selection invest 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.570
 we go to the part of down here 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.540
 color balance we pass it to the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.599
 part of up 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.849
 and then we already change 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.040
 tonality in this case I'm just going to 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.590
 increase the red so that it looks similar 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.180
 to the tone that we are driving and good at 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.819
 if they have left in the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.129
 hair boundaries we select the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.829
 layer that we made the quick layer we 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.689
 let the tool rubber 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.590
 we are only going through the contour 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.459
 to remove 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.210
 if something if something happened to us in this case 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.330
 I left here 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.130
 in this part 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.600
 and I'm only going through the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.600
 outline to be able to eliminate it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.580
 and well it is very fast this would be 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.620
 I hope everything has been served to them 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.740
 doubt ask me greetings 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.740
 bye
