00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
and now I just have a bunch of sweeping

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.170 
and now I just have a bunch of sweeping
our<00:00:17.760> arpeggios<00:00:19.949> they're<00:00:20.949> just<00:00:20.980> minor<00:00:21.730> 7

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
our arpeggios they're just minor 7

our arpeggios they're just minor 7
arpeggios<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:24.189> you're<00:00:24.910> into<00:00:25.150> our<00:00:25.270> manin

scale<00:00:28.450> you<00:00:28.630> have<00:00:28.720> three<00:00:29.020> minor<00:00:29.259> seven<00:00:29.790> chords

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
scale you have three minor seven chords

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
scale you have three minor seven chords
which<00:00:31.239> will<00:00:31.360> be<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.599> second<00:00:32.079> third<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.040> sixth

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
which will be the second third and sixth

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.860 
which will be the second third and sixth
of<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:35.980> scale<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:39.010> my<00:00:39.730> case<00:00:39.760> or<00:00:40.300> in<00:00:40.390> this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
of the scale so in my case or in this

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.420 
of the scale so in my case or in this
case<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.730> alienation<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:43.480> would<00:00:43.660> be<00:00:43.840> an<00:00:44.430> E

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
case of alienation it would be an E

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.110 
case of alienation it would be an E
minor<00:00:45.610> 7<00:00:45.820> which<00:00:46.780> would<00:00:47.110> be<00:00:47.520> top<00:00:48.520> three<00:00:48.550> strings

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
minor 7 which would be top three strings

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.630 
minor 7 which would be top three strings
nine<00:00:49.600> eight<00:00:50.010> seven<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.130> then<00:00:51.760> ten<00:00:52.150> a<00:00:53.640> minor

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
nine eight seven and then ten a minor

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.049 
nine eight seven and then ten a minor
seven<00:00:55.180> starting<00:00:55.900> 14<00:00:56.500> 13<00:00:57.400> 12<00:00:57.750> 15<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:58.989> 16<00:01:00.780> 15<00:01:01.780> 14

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
seven starting 14 13 12 15 and 16 15 14

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.480 
seven starting 14 13 12 15 and 16 15 14
17<00:01:04.320> basically<00:01:05.320> just<00:01:05.470> hold<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.040> oil<00:01:06.220> which

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
17 basically just hold on the oil which

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.149 
17 basically just hold on the oil which
would<00:01:06.670> be<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.790> B<00:01:07.030> minor<00:01:07.270> 7<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.680> what<00:01:08.799> i'm<00:01:08.890> doing

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
would be a B minor 7 so what i'm doing

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.290 
would be a B minor 7 so what i'm doing
here<00:01:09.369> is

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.920 

I<00:01:15.190> explained<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.400> E<00:01:16.550> minor<00:01:16.880> 7<00:01:17.240> arpeggio

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
I explained on the E minor 7 arpeggio

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.310 
I explained on the E minor 7 arpeggio
goons<00:01:18.770> I'm<00:01:19.340> sleeping<00:01:19.910> so<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:20.870> down<00:01:21.080> down

pager<00:01:32.810> Pedro<00:01:33.740> would<00:01:34.490> be<00:01:34.610> this<00:01:35.710> chords<00:01:36.710> notes

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
pager Pedro would be this chords notes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.960 
pager Pedro would be this chords notes
of<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.880> chord<00:01:38.240> played<00:01:38.540> separately<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:42.970> not

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
of the chord played separately so not

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.340 
of the chord played separately so not
like<00:01:44.120> this<00:01:45.670> down<00:01:46.670> down<00:01:46.880> down<00:01:47.090> up<00:01:47.360> pull<00:01:47.720> up<00:01:47.960> down

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
like this down down down up pull up down

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.440 
like this down down down up pull up down
the<00:01:48.560> half<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.470> then<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.760> shift

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the half so I do this then I I shift

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.820 
the half so I do this then I I shift
into<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.320> 12th<00:01:54.620> position<00:01:55.780> 14<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:56.930> want

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
into the 12th position 14 if you want

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.980 
into the 12th position 14 if you want
starting<00:01:58.190> up<00:01:59.770> string<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:02.770> 16<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.580> then

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
starting up string and then 16 and then

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.560 
starting up string and then 16 and then
back<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.200> octave<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.120> end<00:02:11.360> like

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
back to the octave and then I end like

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.040 
back to the octave and then I end like
this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.100 

so<00:02:16.050> that's<00:02:16.340> basically<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.720> e-

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
so that's basically just a in the e-

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.320 
so that's basically just a in the e-

out the minor 6 sometimes you know the
six<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.620> an<00:03:02.430> awkward<00:03:02.910> note<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.260> play<00:03:06.379> some

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
six can be an awkward note to play some

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.380 
six can be an awkward note to play some
people<00:03:07.650> refer<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> these<00:03:08.280> kind<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.670> notes<00:03:09.150> also

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
people refer to these kind of notes also

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.849 
people refer to these kind of notes also
its<00:03:09.660> avoid<00:03:10.049> notes<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.040> I'm<00:03:14.129> playing<00:03:15.859> 19

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
its avoid notes so I'm playing 19

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.390 
its avoid notes so I'm playing 19
straight<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.900> 22<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:21.980> I'm<00:03:22.980> having<00:03:23.280> this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
straight to 22 and then I'm having this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.200 
straight to 22 and then I'm having this
band<00:03:24.919> josa<00:03:25.919> has<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> rhythmic<00:03:27.470> function

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
band josa has a rhythmic function

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:38.970 
band josa has a rhythmic function
okay<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.580> whole<00:03:32.760> solo<00:03:33.770> would<00:03:34.770> be

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.119 

then<00:03:39.640> we<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.909> this

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.680 

and<00:03:45.129> we<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.640> tapping<00:03:46.209> string<00:03:46.480> skipping

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
and we have the tapping string skipping

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.560 
and we have the tapping string skipping
leg

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:03.450 

and<00:03:52.570> then<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.840> have<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:52.990> sweep<00:03:53.350> in<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.800> that's
