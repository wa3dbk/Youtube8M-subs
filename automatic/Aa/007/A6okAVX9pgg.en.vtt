00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.990
 this lesson 1 introduction to polygonal modeling we have seen 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.500
 until now 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 how to create simple enam bassanza objects 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.439
 from standard primitives 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.369
 as an example an object of type box 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.369
 you can convert 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.399
 an object of this type in one in another form 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.179
 hair we need to convert not because for now the only ones 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.409
 changes we can make 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.600
 they are related to milk 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.859
 at the length the depth 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.620
 at the height of the number of segments on the object 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.840
 if we want to have available 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.120
 leaf other options to make other changes we can convert project 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040
 right-clicking 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.750
 fish laugh from the converter menu. we have several options available 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 we are an example converter all bol bol mecha 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.110
 in this way 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.420
 the object mara box project true converted 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 in a mechanical work night i'm not editable mailup 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.730
 certainly not that it has more revenue 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.580
 that is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 hindi vertices 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.500
 that we can 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 select which are and these points of blue color 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 that 6 selected change their color 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.410
 not red 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.570
 we also change the color of the object 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.050
 way to display at its best 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 the vertices 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.469
 then vertices if selected a are red color otherwise 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.369
 with a color 1 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.479
 we can therefore 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.310
 access the vertices letter move 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.369
 and then make further changes for example in this way 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 or we can access help 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.700
 at the sides in which they are 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 it is practically in Italy all the segments that combine 2 vertifight we are 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.170
 then move also 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 en these segments 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.450
 or we can ideally embrace facebook 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.999
 in our act in our object of our figure 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.389
 and these faces 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.319
 am it was practically - 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.579
 literno blond of every single with the square you see 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.109
 the polygons, on the other hand, are the whole 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.900
 square in this case 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.600
 defined. from the intersections of the three segments 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.560
 the element 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.689
 instead penises the internal puntochat list 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.849
 the whole figure 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.420
 we have several options available in the sliding panel 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.959
 and we can turn on 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.879
 aica and several sublevels by clicking and then selecting from 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.619
 detaches or 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.169
 in the den 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.049
 in the seleccion panel 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.609
 we can select the example 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.689
 Bertex 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.459
 and access the vertices 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.469
 of the object 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 in this world 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.080
 we saw vamp 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.350
 how to convert the box object into an editable mesh 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.649
 taranto 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.559
 convert the object 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.929
 also in an HD poly stamp 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:23.379
 in this world 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.230
 the substantial difference that remedies sublevels of one of dabol poles 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.790
 I am not even nearly the same and that is we have the possibility of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.299
 access the vertices 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.419
 you have 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.010
 the t 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.889
 they are the segments that unite 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.889
 the two Alitalia polygon vertices 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.919
 these or the whole element 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.049
 m brush strokes of tabor mechanic 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.279
 this entry is called feissss 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 and contains a selects half polygon 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.439
 inna foxes fingers 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.930
 the abyss that level is if there is not but there is this level called biting 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.579
 if for example 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.819
 select 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.959
 holding down the control key 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:12.989
 these 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.709
 polygons, etc. we delete them 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.249
 we have the possibility of enam 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.559
 melere 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.320
 the underlay beading 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.370
 that is clicking 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.819
 in this area 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.259
 we select the edge of an art in our concert 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.140
 in the same way 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.319
 in the gallery an object in force foxes life available 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.969
 in the tab 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.879
 seleccion 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.879
 in several buttons that allow you to switch on 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.129
 Go individual sub-levels 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.569
 in this world and we can access sub-levels 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 ah. wave detaches it from the back 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.270
 from the select shawl panel we can also use numbers on the 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.310
 keyboard 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.599
 that is 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.889
 by clicking on fox loss with the 1 key we access the vertices with the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:08.779
 button 2 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:09.900
 ali the t 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.319
 that key 3 then edges 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.539
 button 4 the polygons button 5 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.039
 to the element 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.189
 if terrific we are the 5 key we return to ethics volponi that is we have the 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.110
 possibility to move the whole 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.110
 the whole object 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.479
 band at the next lesson 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.650
 we begin 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.639
 just build 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.599
 small punat is a choice 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.699
 and we will see slowly 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.479
 all these panels and these emotions that we have available to shape 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.550
 our concert
