00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 country together with country cool climate and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 nearly 500 other dairy farmers 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 Together they provide the best milk 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.249
 and make the best cheese 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.289
 that just makes the difference 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:24.749
 Inside, the cows are lying on waterbeds 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.939
 You can not use these waterbeds 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.490
 human beings are comparing people 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.560
 need a thick layer of cabbage 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.389
 however, lie on a nice thin 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.969
 layer of water on which she is wonderful 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.399
 lie and rock we are permanent 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.779
 busy with ruminating 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.779
 her big hull is moving 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 from kus 1 0 it is for a cow 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.500
 difficult to scratch your back 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.070
 That's why she uses a brush you can 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 to see it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:01.080
 behind the ears on the back the cows 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 move around it with great pleasure 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.310
 are for in doing something adorned 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.140
 and then others are moody 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.979
 again very sociable and that is then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.979
 again very pleasing 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.480
 compared to the national average 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.579
 is the sickness one piece with us 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 lower with clown problems we have 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.359
 a lot less trouble what a lot 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.560
 Nice is that is also pleasant for us 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.540
 as a farmer, if a farmer 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.689
 he also has miserable cows 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.819
 Unfortunately, this is the last one 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.530
 end product the unique taste 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.599
 of gamestar cheese 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.250
 you can only delicious cheese 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.400
 produce if everything fits 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.810
 the grass quality must be good the cows 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 have to be satisfied 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.669
 they have to be able to go to both 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.799
 when the time is ripe, it is ripe 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.750
 starts at the base of the calves 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.909
 have to get enough space and to 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 to be able to grow up healthy and healthy 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.719
 with enough light and space 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.700
 the success of arnim tanks kurhotel 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.439
 is created by the love that hers 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.480
 profession and also through 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.269
 her innovative view of her business 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.799
 I'm crazy about king 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.180
 Still following to Cologne and me 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.519
 I think is always crazy yet 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.629
 stay cool 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.760
 There is a big need 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.620
 innovative dairy farmers but many 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.930
 Farmers are still too conservative 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.799
 One should dare to take new steps and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.799
 to break new ground 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.980
 as familiar is the difference 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.380
 between a delicious cheese and butter 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.840
 cheese is in my opinion the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.630
 suppleness and the feeling that the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.760
 taste in the mouth stays that can 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.930
 you do not even describe that you have to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.930
 just could taste
