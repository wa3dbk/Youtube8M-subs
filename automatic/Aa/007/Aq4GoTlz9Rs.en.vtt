 Hi .. I'm Lee Min Ho 

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:09.658
 Thank you for coming 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.377
 The use of the word "album" is a little strange to me ... but 

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.119
 I worked hard to prepare him 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.815
 The meeting was supposed to take place last year 

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:29.360
 But because of the pictorial agenda of the drama of "Faith", I could not do that 

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.641
 And finally .. after two years .. meet with my fans 

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.199
 So ... I'm excited and waiting for this meeting 

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:43.227
 Instead of saying that it is a secret weapon .. 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.993
 This will be the first time I sing in different songs at a concert 

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:56.127
 The album itself contains different songs in style 

00:00:56.128 --> 00:01:00.456
 So I planned to show different aspects of my style on stage 

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:12.612
 Personally, when I sing in karaoke or when I need it, I usually sing quiet songs 

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:17.749
 This time .. And once I sing the fastest songs melody 

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:19.971
 So it was a bit difficult 

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:28.462
 And ... when I was recording I actually tried to find a sound that was appropriate and good 

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:37.556
 For Japan, the titles of the album's songs will be different 

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:42.319
 Because each country has its own color 

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:49.800
 So I think the songs will vary by country 

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:55.327
 Also, I plan to show different performances related to different countries 

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:03.656
 If I had planned to make this album presented in music programs 

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:07.826
 I was tired. I could not complete it 

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:13.334
 The idea of ​​this album was four years ago after the fans met a drama time for boys before flowers 

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:15.895
 When I wanted to have my own songs 

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:21.472
 And also to have songs to entertain me Enjoy with fans .. This was my utmost desire 

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:24.555
 That's why I was released as a special album 

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:30.063
 I did not worry much about my portrayal 

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:37.931
 I read comments written by the Meinuz .. So I'm excited for today 

00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:42.583
 I could not sleep well yesterday, and I think there are others besides me 

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:50.124
 So I decided to have fun with everyone and make interesting shows 

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:54.421
 The best song for me from the album is: '' Cut Love '' 

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:56.558
 I thank everyone for coming today. 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:05.437
 Try to make the best and show me a good picture thanks to your presence 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:11.026
 After the end of the tour .. offer the best for the drama and meet you again 

00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:12.359
 Thank you for coming 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360
