00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.730 

well<00:01:14.770> what<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.159> is<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.180> called<00:01:16.540> neo<00:01:17.440> based

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
well what you see is so called neo based

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.500 
well what you see is so called neo based
on<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:21.510> electric

history<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.290> instrument<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.979> quite

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
history of this instrument is quite

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
history of this instrument is quite
interesting<00:01:37.840> actually<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.000> result<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
interesting actually it's the result of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.320 
interesting actually it's the result of
military<00:01:42.040> research<00:01:44.190> because<00:01:45.190> in<00:01:45.400> in<00:01:45.970> the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
military research because in in the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.389 
military research because in in the
twenties<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.080> thirties<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.100> former

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
twenties and thirties of the former

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.670 
twenties and thirties of the former
century<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:51.220> Berlin<00:01:51.789> they<00:01:52.750> were<00:01:52.810> researching

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
century in Berlin they were researching

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.960 
century in Berlin they were researching
on<00:01:55.710> broadcasting<00:01:56.710> technology<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:59.789> order<00:02:00.789> to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
on broadcasting technology in order to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.889 
on broadcasting technology in order to
have<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:02.070> sort<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.190> same<00:02:03.369> at<00:02:03.520> once<00:02:03.789> for<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.509> next

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
have a sort of same at once for the next

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.669 
have a sort of same at once for the next
wall<00:02:05.440> because<00:02:06.369> they<00:02:06.550> can<00:02:07.289> speak<00:02:08.289> with<00:02:08.530> their

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
wall because they can speak with their

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.560 
wall because they can speak with their
troops<00:02:08.979> somewhere<00:02:09.940> out<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.300> field<00:02:10.600> and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
troops somewhere out in the field and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.250 
troops somewhere out in the field and
that<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.650> say<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.150> aim<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.660> because

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that was so to say the aim of it because

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110 
that was so to say the aim of it because
I've<00:02:17.380> been<00:02:17.500> doing<00:02:17.700> specialization<00:02:18.700> projects

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I've been doing specialization projects

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.780 
I've been doing specialization projects
before<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.110> also<00:02:20.320> play<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.370> into<00:02:21.670> this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
before that I also play this into this

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.539 
before that I also play this into this
life<00:02:21.970> yeah<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:24.010> what<00:02:24.130> I'm<00:02:24.220> doing<00:02:24.430> tonight

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
life yeah that's what I'm doing tonight

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.240 
life yeah that's what I'm doing tonight
it's<00:02:24.970> gonna<00:02:25.120> move<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> sound<00:02:26.110> across<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it's gonna move the sound across the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's gonna move the sound across the
speakers<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.850> not<00:02:28.000> static<00:02:28.239> it's<00:02:28.480> moving<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
speakers it's not static it's moving and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.420 
speakers it's not static it's moving and
we<00:02:30.070> tried<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.670> find<00:02:31.500> moving<00:02:32.500> moving<00:02:32.860> patterns

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
we tried to find moving moving patterns

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.539 
we tried to find moving moving patterns
that<00:02:33.760> match<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.870> nature<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.620> handholds

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
that match the nature of handholds

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.430 
that match the nature of handholds
playing<00:02:36.910> yes<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.019> like<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.320> want

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
playing yes it's like if you want

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.930 
playing yes it's like if you want
example<00:02:38.920> he's<00:02:39.459> playing<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.780> these<00:02:40.870> stones

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
example he's playing with these stones

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.110 
example he's playing with these stones
stones<00:02:42.940> here<00:02:44.040> he<00:02:45.040> puts<00:02:45.220> them<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.459> strings<00:02:45.850> I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
stones here he puts them on strings I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.620 
stones here he puts them on strings I
don't<00:02:46.329> do<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.540> now<00:02:46.720> but

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.710 

yeah<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.070> he<00:02:54.250> hits<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.210> stones<00:02:55.480> with

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
yeah and then he hits the stones with

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.060 
yeah and then he hits the stones with
the<00:02:55.750> transiting<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.680> then<00:02:56.830> they<00:02:56.980> go

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
the transiting here and then they go

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.390 
the transiting here and then they go
like<00:02:57.280> this

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
like this

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.149 
like this
yeah<00:02:59.080> yeah<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.720> sound<00:03:02.720> yeah<00:03:03.349> and

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
yeah yeah so you get this sound yeah and

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.759 
yeah yeah so you get this sound yeah and
that<00:03:04.519> for<00:03:04.670> example<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:05.120> combined<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
that for example be combined with the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.720 
that for example be combined with the
movement<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:08.150> very<00:03:08.330> Chompy
