00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 girls hello and today I want 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.490
 tell you about my purchases so I 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 too much strong attention to focus on 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 I will not shoot them like 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 full video so I will do it 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.119
 Vlog video and the first thing I want you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.789
 show this here is such a starter from 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.830
 firms holika holika what is all 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.949
 starter by the way I have with hyaluronic 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 acid starter is such a thing 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.960
 which we apply immediately after washing 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.329
 he is very very nice texture 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 how so watery a little bit so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 he has a convenient bomb all they need with 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.329
 This starter is very well absorbed 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.420
 then cream since he is hyaluronic 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.420
 acid then nourishes your skin with moisture 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.140
 he is a large volume here 150 milliliters 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.440
 so here it looks literally need 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.390
 a couple of bombs to put on your face he 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.809
 instantly absorbed since he 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.420
 he has such a watery texture very much to me 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.560
 like and also the second product is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 Bibi cream from skinfood with me with lemon 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 this is a series of their good afternoon here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 sun protection spf20 bomb him 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 do not help to such a spout 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 on the texture he will say a little different 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.049
 from ordinary Korean baby klims 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 since the texture is inward under oh zero 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.530
 not gray but a bit yellowish 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 I took it gray because I did not have 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.920
 earlier 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 I liked skinfood baby creams 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 the fact that it is light in texture but if you 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.869
 I don't like light coverage 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.030
 I still like it better 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.490
 the density of the tonal basis is such an average 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.469
 so I really liked that he did not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 such a very light texture if 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.399
 you are not a problem skin then it is for you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.869
 will fit 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.300
 Well, of course you can put it on your face 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.210
 and some problem areas for 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.160
 smear with concealer and corrector then 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.930
 everything will smell good he has a very 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.270
 nice so unobtrusive 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.580
 I really want to try later 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.850
 other series since i have with lemon 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.240
 there is green tea peach grapes and 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.570
 various others if anyone is interested in these 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.970
 two products starter and bibi cream i 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.580
 ordered on ebay 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.830
 link to the seller where I 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.080
 I ordered to leave under the video as me 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.250
 when ordered i had six 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.010
 various probes and gave me this in 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.470
 business card to implement such as 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.300
 brochure with their online store if 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.180
 it is interesting for you to write like this 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.520
 There, too, you can order products even 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.700
 we are not very pretty soon rather 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.130
 Well, for two weeks I don't like them either 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.460
 service if you have something but simply 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.680
 not 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.890
 I am happy to answer them, too, not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.850
 I like this as well tell you about 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.650
 my new leave for the face 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.480
 this firm is korean korean or 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.340
 Japanese find out I'll write somewhere the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.100
 on top 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.630
 the fate of the noise is probably called the fate of noise 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.730
 It costs and records of products is some water 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.080
 like a tonic but after him is fine 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.720
 humidification also multi 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.390
 face cream serum and night mask 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.150
 I don’t wash the night mask and put it on 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.100
 face go to bed and only wash off in the morning 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
 Well, how do I wash water 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.220
 these are such bestsellers fate company 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.430
 noise this cosmetics care is considered 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.570
 luxury in japan and she is very cool 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.540
 this whole collection is valid so let's say with 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.250
 ginseng extract 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.950
 but since I ordered it, you still 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.900
 I use it although it is intended to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.290
 skin over 25 years old but I have not 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.840
 too much in general honestly i don't 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.840
 I know what sequence you need 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.220
 wear these products I wash my face first 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 by the way I will tell you a bit of my care 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.790
 new at first i wash my face with one of the testicles 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.010
 which I reviewed the link on 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.500
 i put somewhere here here is natural 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.919
 and I wash my face further. 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.530
 balance and water like a tonic she 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.080
 happy so they do texture 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.510
 truth who is not like water a little bit like that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.540
 as viscous or something quite a bit 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.110
 so it can be worn without cotton 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.130
 disk 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.560
 Next I apply emulsion cream or 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.750
 first cream son then serum or without 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.389
 our serums are just cream and mask 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.030
 I don’t put a nickname on every night 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.570
 I like the night 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.979
 I like the effect of these creams 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.740
 no irritation they cause 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.169
 so I liked the link there 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.720
 losing them I ordered on ebay 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.389
 also leave downstairs also I had 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.840
 Such a sampler baby cream from Misha 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.700
 Signal than he fills wrinkles left 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.190
 37 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.740
 not at all he did not like him 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.630
 very few holds on the face of it 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.020
 I will not take the full-size version 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.600
 I also have with this store which I 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.440
 I told you also at the cosmetic market 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.880
 I was so leaky from Misha 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.680
 cleansing oil I never 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.229
 used cleansing oil to 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.169

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:02.860

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.039
 He's not with you not because he's bags 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.530
 Chinese green tea looks like 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:12.070

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.889
