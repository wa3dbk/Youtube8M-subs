these<00:02:06.780> smaller<00:02:07.140> ones<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.550> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
these smaller ones I just use this

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.980 
these smaller ones I just use this
medium<00:02:09.420> sized<00:02:09.690> ball<00:02:10.050> tip<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
medium sized ball tip and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.650 
medium sized ball tip and
which<00:02:11.650> those<00:02:12.010> really<00:02:12.580> well<00:02:12.790> until<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.390> kind

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
which those really well until they kind

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.290 
which those really well until they kind
of<00:02:13.780> form<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.350> nice<00:02:14.530> bowl<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> even<00:02:16.150> took

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
of form a nice bowl and then I even took

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.330 
of form a nice bowl and then I even took
one<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.570> them<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.870> really<00:02:17.620> squished<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.220> in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
one of them and really squished it in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
one of them and really squished it in
when<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.670> was<00:02:18.820> done<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.270> kind<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> create<00:02:20.050> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
when I was done to kind of create the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.580 
when I was done to kind of create the
center<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> flower<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.230> next<00:02:23.410> thing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
center of the flower so the next thing

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.380 
center of the flower so the next thing
we're<00:02:23.710> going<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.400> go<00:02:24.880> ahead<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.180> start

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
we're going to do is go ahead and start

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.310 
we're going to do is go ahead and start
gluing<00:02:25.990> our<00:02:26.140> flower<00:02:26.470> layers<00:02:26.830> together<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.960> I'm

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
gluing our flower layers together so I'm

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.870 
gluing our flower layers together so I'm
gonna<00:02:29.500> take<00:02:29.800> these<00:02:30.100> three<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.640> kind<00:02:30.820> of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
gonna take these three and kind of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.370 
gonna take these three and kind of
offset<00:02:31.360> them<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.690> I'm<00:02:31.750> going<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.960> choose<00:02:32.140> my

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
offset them and I'm going to choose my

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.130 
offset them and I'm going to choose my
favorite<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> top<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.600> think<00:02:34.750> I'll

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
favorite one for the top I think I'll

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
favorite one for the top I think I'll
save<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.010> top<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.820> then<00:02:37.360> I'm

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
save that one for the top and then I'm

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.600 
save that one for the top and then I'm
just<00:02:37.690> gonna<00:02:38.010> glue<00:02:39.010> them<00:02:39.250> where<00:02:39.460> they're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
just gonna glue them where they're

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:50.130 
just gonna glue them where they're
offset<00:02:39.790> offset<00:02:40.600> those<00:02:41.050> petals<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:49.630> course<00:02:49.900> my

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
offset offset those petals of course my

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
offset offset those petals of course my
glue<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.440> going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:55.500> okay<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:56.860> just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
glue is going to be okay so I'm just

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.090 
glue is going to be okay so I'm just
gonna<00:02:58.020> put<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.080> little<00:02:59.230> glue<00:02:59.560> down<00:02:59.770> in<00:02:59.920> there

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
gonna put a little glue down in there

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.420 
gonna put a little glue down in there
and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.490> I'm<00:03:00.580> gonna<00:03:00.700> put<00:03:01.120> my<00:03:01.300> next<00:03:01.540> layer<00:03:01.870> in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and then I'm gonna put my next layer in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.400 
and then I'm gonna put my next layer in
making<00:03:03.430> sure<00:03:03.460> that<00:03:03.640> those<00:03:03.900> offset<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.170> right

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
making sure that those offset just right

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.460 
making sure that those offset just right
keep<00:03:06.250> everything<00:03:06.520> nice<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.820> centered<00:03:07.470> and

those for my last couple layers I'm

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.290 
those for my last couple layers I'm
trying<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.300> offset<00:03:56.690> these<00:03:56.840> as<00:03:57.080> well<00:03:58.150> once<00:03:59.150> I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
trying to offset these as well once I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.180 
trying to offset these as well once I
get<00:03:59.360> them<00:03:59.600> all<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.840> place<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.470> will<00:04:00.740> hold<00:04:01.010> them

get them all in place I will hold them

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.270 
get them all in place I will hold them
really<00:04:01.490> tight<00:04:04.660> okay<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.900> use<00:04:06.620> my<00:04:06.860> little<00:04:07.010> ball

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
really tight okay I use my little ball

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.860 
really tight okay I use my little ball
tip<00:04:07.670> just<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.120> hold<00:04:08.300> those<00:04:08.540> really<00:04:08.870> tight<00:04:09.140> you

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
tip just to hold those really tight you

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.710 
tip just to hold those really tight you
can<00:04:11.870> kind<00:04:12.080> of<00:04:12.200> squish<00:04:12.920> those<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.790> start

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
can kind of squish those and start

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.680 
can kind of squish those and start
creating<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.230> nice<00:04:15.830> Center<00:04:18.730> place<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:20.030> last

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
creating this nice Center place the last

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.570 
creating this nice Center place the last
one<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.230> a<00:04:25.000> smaller<00:04:26.000> ball<00:04:26.330> tip<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:27.460> pusher<00:04:28.460> it

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
one in a smaller ball tip to pusher it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.600 
one in a smaller ball tip to pusher it
down<00:04:28.760> in<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.000> middle<00:04:30.070> okay<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.130> now<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.430> have

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
down in the middle okay so now you have

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.230 
down in the middle okay so now you have
this<00:04:31.730> nice<00:04:31.970> Center<00:04:32.540> real<00:04:33.350> tight<00:04:33.650> bud<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:35.060> can

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
this nice Center real tight bud that can

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.180 
this nice Center real tight bud that can
go<00:04:35.390> right<00:04:35.630> in<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.870> middle<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:36.169> our<00:04:36.320> flower

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.140 

into<00:04:43.190> place<00:04:46.600> not<00:04:47.600> pretty<00:04:48.160> okay<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.940> last

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
into place not pretty okay the last

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.940 
into place not pretty okay the last
thing<00:04:50.390> we<00:04:50.479> need<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.660> do<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:51.320> attach<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:52.370> leaf

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
thing we need to do is attach the leaf
