other your wide magazine offers it's

really great trough so you can just take

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.490 
really great trough so you can just take
a<00:04:32.560> handful<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.280> marbles<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.870> pour<00:04:35.230> them

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
a handful of marbles and that pour them

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.070 
a handful of marbles and that pour them
in<00:04:35.710> like<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.010> it's<00:04:36.730> rarely<00:04:37.210> disk<00:04:37.660> clogged

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
in like that it's rarely disk clogged

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.230 
in like that it's rarely disk clogged
because<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.070> think<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.550> why<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.850> wide

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
because I think the why the wide

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.360 
because I think the why the wide
magazine<00:04:40.750> gets<00:04:41.020> clogged<00:04:41.350> usually<00:04:41.950> is<00:04:42.070> because

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
magazine gets clogged usually is because

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.730 
magazine gets clogged usually is because
it's<00:04:42.550> at<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.820> weird<00:04:43.060> angle<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.900> marble<00:04:44.530> sort

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
it's at that weird angle and marble sort

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.620 
it's at that weird angle and marble sort
of<00:04:44.830> get<00:04:44.920> stuck<00:04:45.190> as<00:04:45.460> they<00:04:45.610> start<00:04:46.030> rolling<00:04:46.420> in

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
of get stuck as they start rolling in

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.630 
of get stuck as they start rolling in
but<00:04:47.050> because<00:04:47.410> this<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> different<00:04:48.400> angle

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
but because this is at a different angle

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.050 
but because this is at a different angle
they<00:04:49.600> roll<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.320> fun<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.890> haven't<00:04:51.430> had<00:04:51.610> much

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
they roll in just fun I haven't had much

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.090 
they roll in just fun I haven't had much
problems<00:04:52.750> with<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:54.420> this<00:04:55.420> alone<00:04:55.960> is<00:04:56.290> reason

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
problems with that this alone is reason

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.910 
problems with that this alone is reason
enough<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.850> get<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.510> magazine<00:04:58.810> it's<00:04:59.560> really

I'd<00:05:04.300> say<00:05:04.690> if<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.470> don't<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.860> any<00:05:06.340> magazines

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
I'd say if you don't have any magazines

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.570 
I'd say if you don't have any magazines
this<00:05:07.720> probably<00:05:08.230> isn't<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.800> best<00:05:08.920> one<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.310> get

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
this probably isn't the best one to get

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.520 
this probably isn't the best one to get
i<00:05:09.730> still<00:05:10.090> think<00:05:10.270> i<00:05:10.450> recommend<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.020> system

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
i still think i recommend the system

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.460 
i still think i recommend the system
