slide the caliper off there's my two

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.410 
slide the caliper off there's my two
brake<00:00:21.449> pads<00:00:21.779> they're<00:00:21.960> pretty<00:00:22.140> worn<00:00:23.119> now<00:00:24.119> I'm

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
brake pads they're pretty worn now I'm

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.700 
brake pads they're pretty worn now I'm
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> compress<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> piston<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.590> way<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
going to compress the piston the way I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.160 
going to compress the piston the way I
do<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:27.330> slide<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.730> over<00:00:29.730> your

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
do it is just slide it on over your

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.269 
do it is just slide it on over your
rotor<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.070> put<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
rotor like that and then just put a

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.700 
rotor like that and then just put a
little<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.640> pressure<00:00:32.820> outside<00:00:33.710> towards

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
little bit of pressure outside towards

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
little bit of pressure outside towards
the<00:00:34.770> wheel<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> compress<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the wheel and it's going to compress the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.260 
the wheel and it's going to compress the
piston<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.290> bit<00:00:37.910> don't<00:00:38.910> push<00:00:39.090> hard

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
piston a little bit don't push hard

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
piston a little bit don't push hard
enough<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> bend<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:39.989> rotor<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.739> going

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
enough to bend your rotor it's not going

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
enough to bend your rotor it's not going
to<00:00:40.950> bend<00:00:41.129> your<00:00:41.250> rotor<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.670> shouldn't<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:43.140> there

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to bend your rotor it shouldn't if there

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.479 
to bend your rotor it shouldn't if there
is<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:43.800> something<00:00:44.010> seriously<00:00:44.399> wrong

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is and there's something seriously wrong

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
is and there's something seriously wrong
with<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:44.910> brakes<00:00:45.770> now<00:00:46.770> bend<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.399> two

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
with your brakes now bend down these two

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
millimeter bolts and remove the bracket

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.049 
millimeter bolts and remove the bracket
and<00:00:59.070> they're<00:00:59.250> pretty<00:00:59.430> dirty<00:00:59.699> I'll<00:00:59.879> clean

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and they're pretty dirty I'll clean

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.790 
and they're pretty dirty I'll clean
those<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> lube<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.260> before<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.559> put<00:01:01.710> them

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
those up and lube them before I put them

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.729 
those up and lube them before I put them
back<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.660> there's<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.809> old<00:01:03.840> brake<00:01:04.260> pads<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
back in there's my old brake pads I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
back in there's my old brake pads I
believe<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> minimum<00:01:05.189> wear<00:01:05.549> mark<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> half<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
believe the minimum wear mark is half a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
believe the minimum wear mark is half a
millimeter<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.380> past<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.920> there's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
millimeter and it's past that there's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.530 
millimeter and it's past that there's
the<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.290> big<00:01:10.500> pads<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.920> shot

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
the other one so these big pads are shot

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.460 
the other one so these big pads are shot
and<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.900> new<00:01:13.020> ones<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> I'm

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and there's my new ones that I'm

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120 
and there's my new ones that I'm
installed<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> little<00:01:16.619> spring<00:01:16.920> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
installed there is a little spring in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
installed there is a little spring in
there<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.430> puts<00:01:17.610> pressure<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> pad<00:01:18.740> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
there that puts pressure on the pad so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
there that puts pressure on the pad so
when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> install<00:01:20.220> them<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.909> gonna<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
when you install them you're gonna have

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.370 
when you install them you're gonna have
to<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> pressure<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to put a little bit of pressure on the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.940 
to put a little bit of pressure on the
pad<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.320> order<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> get

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
pad this way like this in order to get

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.580 
pad this way like this in order to get
the<00:01:26.430> holes<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.119> line<00:01:27.270> up

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the holes to line up

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
the holes to line up
so<00:01:28.590> install<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.009> first<00:01:29.220> pad<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.409> which

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
so install your first pad that way which

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
so install your first pad that way which
I<00:01:31.530> put<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> shim<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> side<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.509> it

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.139 
bolts tightened down and then bend the
tabs<00:02:00.649> over<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.190> then<00:02:01.759> you're<00:02:01.820> gonna<00:02:01.940> want<00:02:02.119> to

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
tabs over and then you're gonna want to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.499 
tabs over and then you're gonna want to
spread<00:02:02.360> your<00:02:02.509> pads<00:02:02.750> apart<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.170> little<00:02:03.290> bit<00:02:03.470> and

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
spread your pads apart a little bit and

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.800 
spread your pads apart a little bit and
slide<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.869> whole<00:02:05.990> bracket<00:02:06.229> back<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.710> place

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
slide the whole bracket back in place

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.800 
slide the whole bracket back in place
I've<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.080> new<00:02:09.170> pads<00:02:09.440> installed

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
I've got the new pads installed

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810 
I've got the new pads installed
unfortunately<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.820> Moosey

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
unfortunately the I have the Moosey

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.440 
unfortunately the I have the Moosey
brake<00:02:14.030> block<00:02:14.269> off<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.860> pin<00:02:16.160> won't<00:02:17.060> allow

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
brake block off and this pin won't allow

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.020 
brake block off and this pin won't allow
the<00:02:17.510> piston<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.080> compress<00:02:18.470> enough<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.760> get<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the piston to compress enough to get the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.320 
the piston to compress enough to get the
new<00:02:20.150> pads<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:22.190> I'm<00:02:22.580> gonna<00:02:22.730> end<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:22.910> grinding

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
new pads in so I'm gonna end up grinding

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.360 
new pads in so I'm gonna end up grinding
off<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> little<00:02:23.750> bit<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.050> pin<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
off a little bit of this pin so that I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.699 
off a little bit of this pin so that I
can<00:02:25.640> still<00:02:25.880> use<00:02:26.000> my<00:02:26.030> e<00:02:26.239> brake<00:02:26.570> block<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.380> I

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
can still use my e brake block off I

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.410 
can still use my e brake block off I
don't<00:02:28.280> know<00:02:28.459> why<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.000> seems<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
don't know why but it seems like it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.960 
don't know why but it seems like it
should<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:30.310> probably<00:02:31.310> about<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.519> millimeter

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
should be probably about a millimeter

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.390 
should be probably about a millimeter
too<00:02:32.360> deeper<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.860> whole<00:02:34.010> thing<00:02:34.220> should

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
too deeper like the whole thing should

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.500 
too deeper like the whole thing should
be<00:02:34.459> thicker<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.030> hole<00:02:35.269> should<00:02:35.450> be

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
be thicker and that hole should be

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.020 
be thicker and that hole should be
deeper<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:37.190> pin<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.489> come<00:02:37.790> out<00:02:37.970> a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
deeper so that that pin can come out a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.600 
deeper so that that pin can come out a
little<00:02:38.180> bit<00:02:38.420> more<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.709> I'm<00:02:39.980> gonna<00:02:40.100> grind<00:02:40.370> this

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
little bit more so I'm gonna grind this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.699 
little bit more so I'm gonna grind this
off<00:02:40.819> about<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> millimeter<00:02:42.170> or<00:02:42.320> two<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
off about a millimeter or two with the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.580 
off about a millimeter or two with the
Dremel<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:43.549> reinstall<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.590> now

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
Dremel and then reinstall this now

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.490 
Dremel and then reinstall this now
