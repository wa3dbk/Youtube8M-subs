has become dramatically heavier in the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
has become dramatically heavier in the
front<00:00:43.110> suspension<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:44.040> may<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.489> been<00:00:44.520> ok

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
front suspension which may have been ok

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
front suspension which may have been ok
back<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:46.140> isn't<00:00:46.800> anymore

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
back then isn't anymore

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.979 
back then isn't anymore
so<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> needs<00:00:48.539> frequent<00:00:50.000> rebuilding<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so it needs frequent rebuilding in the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540 
so it needs frequent rebuilding in the
shower

here's the here's ears the kingpin from

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.320 
here's the here's ears the kingpin from
you<00:01:14.990> know<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:15.320> sits<00:01:15.619> behind<00:01:16.220> here<00:01:16.760> behind

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
you know that's sits behind here behind

you know that's sits behind here behind
the<00:01:17.600> dust<00:01:18.350> cover<00:01:18.619> in<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.369> top<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.909> kingpin

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
the dust cover in the top of the kingpin

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.050 
the dust cover in the top of the kingpin
has<00:01:20.570> held<00:01:20.840> fast<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.710> held<00:01:22.369> straight<00:01:22.700> up<00:01:22.880> up

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
has held fast and held straight up up

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.380 
has held fast and held straight up up
and<00:01:23.330> down<00:01:23.920> by<00:01:24.920> those<00:01:25.159> bushings<00:01:25.670> well<00:01:26.030> over<00:01:26.360> a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
and down by those bushings well over a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.990 
and down by those bushings well over a
period<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.900> time<00:01:27.140> those<00:01:27.440> bushings<00:01:27.890> fail<00:01:28.250> so

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
period of time those bushings fail so

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.280 
period of time those bushings fail so
there's<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.240> bolt<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:29.720> goes<00:01:29.930> through<00:01:30.259> here

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
there's a bolt that goes through here

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.950 
there's a bolt that goes through here
locks<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:31.490> there's<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.729> bolt<00:01:32.090> which<00:01:32.690> goes

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
locks and then there's a bolt which goes

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.620 
locks and then there's a bolt which goes
across<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.890> bolt<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.580> holds<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.479> whole

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
across that bolt and holds the whole

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.560 
across that bolt and holds the whole
thing<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:36.020> place<00:01:36.580> what<00:01:37.580> happens<00:01:38.119> over<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
thing in place what happens over a

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.040 
thing in place what happens over a
period<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:39.080> time<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.850> though<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.450> top

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
period of time is is though that top

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.279 
period of time is is though that top
bushing<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:42.860> both<00:01:43.100> sides<00:01:43.399> fails<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
bushing on both sides fails and the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.340 
bushing on both sides fails and the
kingpins<00:01:45.830> roll<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.550> at<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.119> top<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.020> we've<00:01:48.200> got

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
kingpins roll in at the top so we've got

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.029 
kingpins roll in at the top so we've got
negative<00:01:48.649> camber<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.289> we're<00:01:51.289> told<00:01:51.770> out

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
negative camber and we're told out

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.609 
negative camber and we're told out
really<00:01:52.610> badly<00:01:53.060> let<00:01:53.929> me<00:01:54.020> show<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.350> what

work on it without having to fight the
spring<00:03:08.400> tension<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> matter<00:03:11.760> of

course<00:03:12.120> now<00:03:12.360> let<00:03:12.510> me<00:03:12.600> see<00:03:12.840> where<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.580> we're

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
course now let me see where the we're

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
course now let me see where the we're
gonna<00:03:14.670> go<00:03:14.940> we're<00:03:15.120> gonna<00:03:15.180> go<00:03:15.300> find<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.020> front

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
gonna go we're gonna go find the front

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.280 
gonna go we're gonna go find the front
hubs<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.520> found<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.970> front<00:03:18.150> hubs<00:03:18.480> I've<00:03:19.050> got

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
hubs so we found the front hubs I've got

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.530 
hubs so we found the front hubs I've got
them<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.740> my<00:03:19.920> nice<00:03:20.100> clean<00:03:20.430> workbench<00:03:21.030> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
them here on my nice clean workbench and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.540 
them here on my nice clean workbench and
you<00:03:22.110> can<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.800> they<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.310> they're<00:03:23.490> all

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
you can see that they that they're all

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.090 
you can see that they that they're all
popped<00:03:23.880> apart<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.990> this<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.070> no

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
popped apart but this is this is of no

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.570 
popped apart but this is this is of no
concern<00:03:26.600> they<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.900> pop<00:03:28.200> apart<00:03:28.620> these<00:03:29.160> can't

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
concern they can pop apart these can't

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.150 
concern they can pop apart these can't
be<00:03:29.670> reused<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> inside<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.100> the

races are buggered up in the brass cage
that<00:03:36.120> held<00:03:36.390> look<00:03:36.630> held<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.110> balls<00:03:37.350> that's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that held look held the balls that's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.070 
that held look held the balls that's
screwed<00:03:38.550> up<00:03:38.760> too<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.270> when<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.570> go<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> pop

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
screwed up too but when you go to pop

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.790 
screwed up too but when you go to pop
this<00:03:40.320> guy<00:03:40.440> apart<00:03:41.160> he<00:03:42.150> necessarily<00:03:42.500> pops<00:03:43.500> out

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
this guy apart he necessarily pops out

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.340 
this guy apart he necessarily pops out
the<00:03:43.830> front<00:03:44.310> that's<00:03:45.180> how<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.510> can<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:46.200> him

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
the front that's how you can get him

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.990 
the front that's how you can get him
clean<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.950> that's<00:03:47.070> how<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.580> grease<00:03:47.790> him

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
clean and that's how you can grease him

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.720 
clean and that's how you can grease him
so<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.690> fact<00:03:48.960> that<00:03:49.080> he's<00:03:49.260> fallen<00:03:49.740> apart<00:03:50.130> is

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so the fact that he's fallen apart is

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.030 
so the fact that he's fallen apart is
not<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> bad<00:03:51.540> thing<00:03:51.570> at<00:03:52.050> all<00:03:52.170> that's<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.890> a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
not a bad thing at all that's just a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
not a bad thing at all that's just a
natural<00:03:53.520> natural<00:03:54.120> thing<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.870> take<00:03:55.050> an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
natural natural thing you can take an

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.680 
natural natural thing you can take an
old<00:03:55.320> bearing<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.220> put<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.240> lot<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.510> grease

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
old bearing and and put a lot of grease

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.480 
old bearing and and put a lot of grease
in<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.990> put<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.320> balls<00:03:58.560> all<00:03:58.830> back<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.250> place

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
in it put the balls all back in place

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.880 
in it put the balls all back in place
and<00:03:59.820> put<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> tabletop<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.620> give<00:04:01.800> it

and put this on the tabletop and give it

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.860 
and put this on the tabletop and give it

a crack with a hammer and the pops right

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.220 
a crack with a hammer and the pops right
back<00:04:04.200> together

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
back together

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.130 
back together
the<00:04:05.349> important<00:04:06.040> thing<00:04:06.340> yet<00:04:06.640> thing<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.510> that

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
the important thing yet thing is that

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.740 
the important thing yet thing is that
when<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.440> put<00:04:08.680> this<00:04:08.860> back<00:04:09.160> on<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.519> hub<00:04:09.790> this

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
when you put this back on the hub this

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.380 
when you put this back on the hub this
is<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.080> inner<00:04:11.319> bearing<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.209> outer

is the inner bearing this is the outer
bearing<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.080> can<00:04:14.140> see<00:04:14.530> they're<00:04:14.709> different

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
bearing you can see they're different

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
and on one edge of the hub it's pretty

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.510 
and on one edge of the hub it's pretty
narrow<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.550> back<00:04:22.789> it's<00:04:23.120> kind<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:23.930> thick

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
narrow on the back it's kind of thick

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.999 
narrow on the back it's kind of thick
same<00:04:25.520> thing<00:04:25.789> here<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.180> got<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.360> thick<00:04:26.720> side<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.830> a

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
same thing here we got a thick side in a

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.700 
same thing here we got a thick side in a
narrow<00:04:28.039> side<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.750> want<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.080> make<00:04:30.139> sure<00:04:30.500> that

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
narrow side you want to make sure that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.050 
narrow side you want to make sure that
when<00:04:30.889> you're<00:04:31.009> putting<00:04:31.039> those<00:04:31.430> into<00:04:31.759> the<00:04:31.849> hub

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
when you're putting those into the hub

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.920 
when you're putting those into the hub
that<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.840> thick<00:04:33.169> sides<00:04:33.470> come<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.039> first

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that the thick sides come in first

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.820 
that the thick sides come in first
because<00:04:35.930> if<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.349> put<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.710> on<00:04:36.830> like<00:04:37.659> this<00:04:38.830> the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
because if you put it on like this the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.059 
because if you put it on like this the
hub<00:04:40.129> can<00:04:40.430> pop<00:04:40.699> off<00:04:41.440> because<00:04:42.440> nothing's

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
hub can pop off because nothing's

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.420 
hub can pop off because nothing's
holding<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.669> in<00:04:43.849> tight<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:44.990> sometimes<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.220> says

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
holding it in tight so sometimes it says

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.990 
holding it in tight so sometimes it says
thrust<00:04:46.879> side<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:48.650> thrust<00:04:48.979> side<00:04:49.280> goes<00:04:49.580> towards

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
thrust side the thrust side goes towards

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.360 
thrust side the thrust side goes towards
the<00:04:50.060> middle<00:04:50.449> so<00:04:51.110> always<00:04:51.470> make<00:04:51.680> sure<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:52.190> when

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
the middle so always make sure that when

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
the middle so always make sure that when
you're<00:04:52.490> putting<00:04:52.699> these<00:04:52.880> back<00:04:52.940> together<00:04:53.389> it

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
you're putting these back together it

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.309 
you're putting these back together it
works<00:04:53.990> now<00:04:54.620> some<00:04:54.949> people<00:04:55.159> will<00:04:55.490> choose<00:04:55.819> to<00:04:56.319> put

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
works now some people will choose to put

taper bearings on the front of a midget

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.290 
taper bearings on the front of a midget
it's<00:05:00.020> not<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.229> bad<00:05:00.560> deal<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:01.669> remember<00:05:02.150> there

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
it's not a bad deal but remember there

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.390 
it's not a bad deal but remember there
is<00:05:02.479> a<00:05:02.509> spacer<00:05:03.289> on<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.620> inside<00:05:04.009> of<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
is a spacer on the inside of the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.080 
is a spacer on the inside of the
original<00:05:04.789> midget<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.720> that<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.849> made<00:05:07.849> up

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
original midget and that that made up

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.649 
original midget and that that made up
with<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.419> inner<00:05:09.349> races<00:05:10.069> of<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.520> bearings<00:05:11.180> and

with the inner races of the bearings and

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.040 
with the inner races of the bearings and
so<00:05:11.930> forth<00:05:12.259> gives<00:05:13.250> you<00:05:13.430> double<00:05:13.729> like<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.509> double

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
so forth gives you double like a double

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.379 
so forth gives you double like a double
wall<00:05:15.289> a<00:05:15.620> double<00:05:16.039> a<00:05:16.250> double<00:05:16.280> thickness<00:05:16.909> and

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
wall a double a double thickness and

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.279 
wall a double a double thickness and
makes<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.259> front<00:05:18.469> end<00:05:18.710> more<00:05:19.870> more<00:05:20.870> sturdy

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
makes the front end more more sturdy

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.620 
makes the front end more more sturdy
than<00:05:22.039> it<00:05:22.219> would<00:05:22.430> be<00:05:22.460> otherwise<00:05:22.610> although<00:05:23.479> I

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
than it would be otherwise although I

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.230 
than it would be otherwise although I
don't<00:05:24.199> think<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:25.009> a<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.370> know<00:05:25.520> Street

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
don't think in a you know Street

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.320 
don't think in a you know Street
application<00:05:27.020> I've<00:05:27.469> never<00:05:27.770> seen<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.330> front

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
application I've never seen a front

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.290 
application I've never seen a front
suspension<00:05:29.479> snap<00:05:30.400> racing<00:05:31.400> whole<00:05:31.940> different

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
suspension snap racing whole different

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.999 
suspension snap racing whole different
story<00:05:32.770> anyway

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
story anyway

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.510 
story anyway
so<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.610> that's<00:05:34.969> the<00:05:35.240> guy<00:05:35.389> here<00:05:36.520> rebuilding

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
so that's that's the guy here rebuilding

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.149 
so that's that's the guy here rebuilding
the<00:05:37.639> kingpins<00:05:38.120> always<00:05:38.690> requires<00:05:39.139> new<00:05:39.469> a-arms

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
the kingpins always requires new a-arms

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.860 
the kingpins always requires new a-arms
so<00:05:40.759> if<00:05:40.909> you're<00:05:41.060> going<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.479> a<00:05:41.509> front

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
so if you're going to do a front

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.990 
so if you're going to do a front
suspension<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.650> complete<00:05:43.039> front<00:05:43.340> suspension

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
suspension a complete front suspension

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.230 
suspension a complete front suspension
