00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
I have a lot of guns and I can get guns

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.400 
I have a lot of guns and I can get guns
except<00:04:02.520> from<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.940> ones<00:04:03.150> from<00:04:03.420> grades<00:04:03.990> I<00:04:04.230> can

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
except from the ones from grades I can

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.930 
except from the ones from grades I can
try<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.710> get<00:04:04.980> those<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.400> am<00:04:05.610> extremely

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
unlucky so also this gun is better to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.490 
unlucky so also this gun is better to
burst<00:04:12.210> if<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.570> haven't<00:04:13.160> saw<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.370> yet<00:04:14.700> and
