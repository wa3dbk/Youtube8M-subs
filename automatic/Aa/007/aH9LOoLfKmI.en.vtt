00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 to the girl surely welcome from 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.470
 woman my name is carolina for those 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.540
 They do not know me and today I come to talk to them 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.839
 about my experience with surgery 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.839
 capillary 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.890
 The first thing I want to tell you is that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 I'm an expert or anything like that in the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 hair I just want to tell you my 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.910
 personal experience right now I do not have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 wet because I want you to see how I 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.360
 It looks wet and already dry or leaf when you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.400
 I speak of drying I do not use at all 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
 neither iron nor dryers nor anything for the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.630
 dried style to the natural this was the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 product that I used well in a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.020
 Little box says plastic capillary is a kit 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.120
 of es lic 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.250
 of 50 milliliters contains three products 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 I send you a little shorter hair 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.530
 what I have right now I had it as 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.970
 around here this and it reached perfectly in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.830
 50 milliliters if you have hair 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.720
 longer you recommend that you buy 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.720
 100 milliliters or two kits of these 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.650
 for the application consult with a 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.960
 professional or someone who already has 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 done like that is me and it cost me 1,500 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 bolivars with the length of my hair 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.940
 including the product forget about that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.680
 you can do it yourself is too much 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.370
 tedious to do this procedure already you 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.370
 I will say why 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.370
 the kit brings three products the first of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.659
 they are a shampoo with which they have 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.060
 wash the hair very well is made to 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.410
 be able to remove any waste or 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.910
 dirt that you have in your hair 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.280
 it's going to leave you with a wire 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.950
 Then use this shampoo to dry your hair 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.780
 with the dryer air but leaving it 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.180
 wet yet the second product is already 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
 capillary surgery itself and we put it in 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.509
 base and we are applying it for all your 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.100
 hair by applying it in all 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.009
 strands in your hair as if it were a 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.330
 dye from the root to the tips and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.910
 re-dry your hair I think with 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.700
 cold air if I remember correctly leaving it and 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.780
 Now comes the most tedious part with me 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.360
 they started at two in the afternoon 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.729
 they finished at six in the afternoon and it's 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 because they have to iron your hair 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.070
 ten times for each strand guys like that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.489
 tiny ten times pass the iron 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.599
 in each lock 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.160
 if they have long they will take you 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.860
 Much more 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.300
 and it is necessary is necessary for 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.560
 look good because they also say 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.610
 instructions that come with this because 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.459
 I'm in with a series of instructions 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.380
 that they can do it faster but not 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.810
 I guarantee that it will last you so much 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 hair surgery with my goal if I 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.950
 They made 10 times each tuft quoted 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.959
 little ones until completing all the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
 hair I think in this procedure 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.599
 of ironing 10 times each strand cited 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.760
 so tiny and well ironed is where 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.380
 is the secret of everything is how you 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.060
 can you really count the second product 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.700
 they never take it out rather they seal it with 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.489
 the iron and you have to last three days 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.299
 with that put on your hair and if you're 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.549
 disgusting 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.010
 my hair got extremely greasy 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.739
 and the worst part is that you can not get wet 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.150
 hair or you can play it then 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.950
 you have to be like if you had to 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.130
 I rest then I spend the three days you go to 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.810
 wash your hair with shampoo without salt and you 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.610
 you are going to explain the conditioner that is 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
 the third product that comes in which and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.349
 then you 're going to let it dry 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.720
 little and you iron it for the last time in 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.240
 your life I have a month more than a month 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.920
 and half I do not know anything about dryers and 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.920
 hair straighteners is ready for me 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.689
 now let 's talk about care with 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.599
 hair surgery you can not use shampoo 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.349
 normal and you have to use shampoo without salt and 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:38.680
 in my case I use my first those who 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.680
 I was using are these are should ok 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.580
 saw that it was say they are without salt with the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.310
 herbal extract and for all kinds of 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.060
 Hair is each container brings 480 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.380
 milliliters 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.940
 this is the shampoo this is the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.830
 conditioner because when he used the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.600
 shampoo alone I do not have left that it has gone so 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.790
 cute but when a single conditioner 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.920
 Obviously, it is precious to me. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.570
 can stop using the the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.430
 conditioner has to be combined 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.410
 so you can see the result in your 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.940
 hair as basically a hydration 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.260
 that you do your hair and apart from 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.210
 that you are using conditioner on 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.920
 hair gets extremely fatty 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.980
 I had to wash it 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.340
 Daily in day should not be very annoying 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.739
 do it but today uy I will not say 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.450
 winds what I am I can not give 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.490
 it's always my first impression of that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.730
 because I do not use it today get 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.000

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.370
 for oily hair has 300 milliliters 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.190
 a little less than the other and much more 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.169
