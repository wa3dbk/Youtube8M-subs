00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
stainless steel cover comes out and then

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.070 
stainless steel cover comes out and then
what<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.900> food

sitting on as far as your cooking

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
sitting on as far as your cooking
surface<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> actually<00:01:13.080> made<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
surface this is actually made out of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.399 
surface this is actually made out of
cast<00:01:13.860> stainless<00:01:14.220> steel<00:01:14.790> which<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.360> by<00:01:15.659> far<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
cast stainless steel which is by far the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
cast stainless steel which is by far the
the<00:01:16.650> most<00:01:16.860> superior<00:01:17.310> cooking<00:01:18.270> surface<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the most superior cooking surface you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
the most superior cooking surface you
can<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> cooking<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.369> rather<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can be cooking on and so rather than a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
can be cooking on and so rather than a
stainless<00:01:22.200> steel<00:01:22.229> welded<00:01:23.220> cooking<00:01:23.670> grid

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
stainless steel welded cooking grid

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
stainless steel welded cooking grid
where<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.210> taking<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.689> several<00:01:25.080> bars<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
where they taking up several bars and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
where they taking up several bars and
they<00:01:25.979> weld<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.400> together<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> support

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
they weld them together and to a support

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.569 
they weld them together and to a support
bar<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.200> front<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> back<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.220> cast

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
bar in front in the back this cast

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.730 
bar in front in the back this cast
stainless<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.750> poured<00:01:31.049> into<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> mold

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
stainless is actually poured into a mold

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.800 
stainless is actually poured into a mold
and<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> hardens<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.360> becomes<00:01:33.720> one

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and as it hardens it all becomes one

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
and as it hardens it all becomes one
piece<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.860> extremely<00:01:35.729> durable<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
piece and so it's extremely durable and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
piece and so it's extremely durable and
heavy-duty<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> worry<00:01:38.100> about

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
heavy-duty you don't have to worry about

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.819 
heavy-duty you don't have to worry about
these<00:01:38.579> cooking<00:01:39.060> grids<00:01:39.360> also<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.619> they're

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
these cooking grids also because they're

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
these cooking grids also because they're
cast<00:01:41.159> stainless<00:01:41.520> steel<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> any

cast stainless steel you don't have any

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
cast stainless steel you don't have any
finish<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.950> might<00:01:44.159> end<00:01:44.399> up

it helps to give a knife nice even heat
across<00:03:39.140> your<00:03:39.440> cooking<00:03:39.739> surface<00:03:40.190> as<00:03:40.519> well<00:03:40.790> as

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
across your cooking surface as well as

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.449 
across your cooking surface as well as
this<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.180> there<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.840> burn<00:03:42.110> off<00:03:42.410> grease<00:03:42.890> that

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
this is there to burn off grease that

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.160 
this is there to burn off grease that
comes<00:03:43.790> off<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.030> your<00:03:44.330> cooking<00:03:44.690> surface

comes off of your cooking surface
anything<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.250> hits<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:46.640> stainless<00:03:46.910> steel

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
anything that hits this stainless steel

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.030 
anything that hits this stainless steel
tray<00:03:47.690> which<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.080> course<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.440> stainless<00:03:48.860> steel

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
tray which of course the stainless steel

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.890 
tray which of course the stainless steel
tray<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.400> very<00:03:49.580> hot<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:50.030> lot<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.660> actually

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
tray is very hot a lot of that actually

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.170 
tray is very hot a lot of that actually
burns<00:03:51.290> off<00:03:51.650> as<00:03:52.010> well<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.430> these<00:03:52.610> ceramic

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
burns off as well as these ceramic

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.970 
burns off as well as these ceramic
gradients<00:03:53.750> are<00:03:53.930> actually<00:03:54.350> porous<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:54.920> they

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
gradients are actually porous and they

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.150 
gradients are actually porous and they
absorb<00:03:55.400> heat<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.880> also<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:57.650> know<00:03:57.739> hold<00:03:57.980> it

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
absorb heat and also you know hold it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.550 
absorb heat and also you know hold it
until<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.519> able<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.880> burn<00:03:59.120> off<00:03:59.390> but<00:03:59.720> again

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
until it's able to burn off but again

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.100 
until it's able to burn off but again
VCs<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:02.180> know<00:04:02.269> they're<00:04:02.480> they're<00:04:02.690> thinking<00:04:03.019> of
