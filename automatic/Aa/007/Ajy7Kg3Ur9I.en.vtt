00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
three may be a 4 in the future I don't

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
three may be a 4 in the future I don't
know<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> look<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.390> know

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
know we have to look into it you know

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
know we have to look into it you know
she<00:00:46.379> would<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.399> people<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
she would you actually get for people to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.439 
she would you actually get for people to
do<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.530> but<00:00:49.530> pretty<00:00:50.039> well<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> strategy

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
do it but pretty well with the strategy

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.170 
do it but pretty well with the strategy
is<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.800> remember<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:53.850> players

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is is you remember the two players

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
is is you remember the two players
strategy<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.440> put<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.309> doing<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
strategy that I put out there doing the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720 
strategy that I put out there doing the
commentary<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.899> least<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:59.340> running

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
commentary for at least I was running

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
commentary for at least I was running
circles<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.170> rob<00:01:01.469> was

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
circles out here and game rob was

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.509 
circles out here and game rob was
running<00:01:02.699> circles<00:01:03.239> inside<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> biodome<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
running circles inside the biodome the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
running circles inside the biodome the
only<00:01:05.820> real<00:01:06.090> difference<00:01:06.450> between<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
only real difference between the two

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
only real difference between the two
player<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> three<00:01:08.250> players<00:01:08.460> strategy<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
player and the three players strategy is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.850 
player and the three players strategy is
that<00:01:10.710> Oh<00:01:10.950> kamrup<00:01:11.700> sit<00:01:11.909> down<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> said<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
that Oh kamrup sit down I said that the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
that Oh kamrup sit down I said that the
two<00:01:16.860> players<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
two players they they are both in the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.190 
two players they they are both in the
biodome<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.750> apparently

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
biodome for the way that that apparently

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
biodome for the way that that apparently
that<00:01:22.409> works<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.689> Julia<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that works out I was in there Julia of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
that works out I was in there Julia of
the<00:01:25.740> only<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.100> who<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.310> likes<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:27.000> icy

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the only one who actually likes be icy

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
the only one who actually likes be icy
road<00:01:27.600> gravity<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> don't<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.530> why<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
road gravity I don't know why but I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.710 
road gravity I don't know why but I
don't<00:01:30.000> find<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> big<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> deal<00:01:31.700> but

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
don't find it that big of a deal but

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
don't find it that big of a deal but
yeah<00:01:33.720> pretty<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> works<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.340> they

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
yeah pretty well how it works it as they

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
yeah pretty well how it works it as they
were<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:36.390> game<00:01:36.720> rob<00:01:36.960> explained<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> me<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
were all game rob explained to me in

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.690 
were all game rob explained to me in
that<00:01:38.960> apparently<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.920> one

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that apparently what you do is have one

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.240 
that apparently what you do is have one
person<00:01:41.909> runs<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.540> circle<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.710> side<00:01:43.950> one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
person runs a circle on one side one

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
person runs a circle on one side one
person<00:01:44.640> runs<00:01:44.850> down<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.360> two

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
person runs down the other two

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.620 
person runs down the other two
apparently<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.380> basic<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.270> not<00:01:48.270> too<00:01:48.420> sure

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
apparently pretty basic but not too sure

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
apparently pretty basic but not too sure
the<00:01:48.840> whole<00:01:49.170> map<00:01:49.470> layout<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> their<00:01:50.520> case<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the whole map layout in their case I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.550 
the whole map layout in their case I
don't<00:01:51.240> spend<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.320> whenever

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
don't spend much time in there whenever

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't spend much time in there whenever
I<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:52.950> moon<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.540> sure<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:54.960> sorry

gonna<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.730> on<00:04:52.850> there<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> little<00:04:53.750> bit

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
gonna go it see it on there a little bit

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.470 
gonna go it see it on there a little bit
more<00:04:54.620> time<00:04:54.890> in<00:04:55.070> between<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.610> shoot<00:04:56.000> their<00:04:56.240> guns
