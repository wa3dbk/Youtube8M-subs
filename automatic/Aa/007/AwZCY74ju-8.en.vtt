massive I mean when I went to pick up
this<00:01:20.380> game<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:20.980> thought<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.340> was<00:01:21.460> going<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.790> be<00:01:21.970> a

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
this game I thought it was going to be a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.890 
this game I thought it was going to be a
small<00:01:22.990> box<00:01:23.760> it<00:01:24.760> may<00:01:24.910> be<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.120> bit<00:01:25.300> bigger<00:01:25.570> than<00:01:25.840> a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
small box it may be a bit bigger than a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.560 
small box it may be a bit bigger than a
we<00:01:26.260> limited<00:01:26.860> edition<00:01:27.400> box<00:01:27.730> but<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.330> is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
we limited edition box but this is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.130 
we limited edition box but this is
really<00:01:28.810> big<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.500> don't<00:01:30.160> even<00:01:30.250> think<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.900> game

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
really big I don't even think this game

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.370 
really big I don't even think this game
it<00:01:32.980> has<00:01:33.040> it's<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:33.940> really<00:01:34.360> massive<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:37.690> here

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
it has it's just really massive so here

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.670 
it has it's just really massive so here
I<00:01:38.410> am<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.280> took<00:01:39.580> off<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.000> back<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.380> I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
I am I just took off the back so that I

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.130 
I am I just took off the back so that I
can<00:01:41.800> actually<00:01:41.979> open<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.790> box<00:01:43.540> because<00:01:43.780> it's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
can actually open the box because it's

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.900 
can actually open the box because it's
kind<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.410> difficult<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.040> open<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
kind of difficult to open it with the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.990 
kind of difficult to open it with the
sticker<00:01:46.150> on<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.390> because<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.229> kind<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.890> made<00:01:48.850> it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
sticker on it because it kind of made it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.700 
sticker on it because it kind of made it
impossible<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.320> here<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:51.509> data<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.710> first

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
impossible so here it is data the first

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.130 
impossible so here it is data the first
thing<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.220> see<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.820> art<00:01:58.330> book<00:01:58.540> which<00:01:58.930> is

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
thing you see is the art book which is

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.980 
thing you see is the art book which is
probably<00:01:59.680> the<00:02:00.009> reason<00:02:00.340> why<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.030> box<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.810> so

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
probably the reason why the box is so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.300 
probably the reason why the box is so
big<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:02.950> decided<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.610> give<00:02:03.759> us<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:04.090> really<00:02:04.330> big

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
big they decided to give us a really big

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.290 
big they decided to give us a really big
