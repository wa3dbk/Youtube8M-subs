00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this I recommend a 3 sensitivity for

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
this I recommend a 3 sensitivity for
this<00:00:42.600> game<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.950> fluent<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this game it's just really fluent and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.479 
this game it's just really fluent and

tactical<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> does<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
tactical and what that does is it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
tactical and what that does is it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.359 
benefit is say you have a high recoil
weapon<00:01:27.210> such<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.040> isn't<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
weapon such as this like this isn't the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
weapon such as this like this isn't the
real<00:01:29.520> recoil<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> high<00:01:30.990> recoil

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
real recoil but if it was a high recoil

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
real recoil but if it was a high recoil
when<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.189> dropping<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> ground<00:01:32.729> it's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
when you're dropping to the ground it's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
when you're dropping to the ground it's
going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> recoil<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.900> his<00:01:34.020> chest<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
going to recoil up to his chest and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.870 
going to recoil up to his chest and
that's<00:01:34.770> another<00:01:35.009> great<00:01:35.220> tip<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> guys

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that's another great tip for you guys

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350 
that's another great tip for you guys
and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.259> downside<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.220> plan<00:01:39.210> on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and the only downside to plan on

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990 
and the only downside to plan on
tactical<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.350> cannot<00:01:40.710> panic<00:01:41.009> knife<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
tactical is you cannot panic knife you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.280 
tactical is you cannot panic knife you
got<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> decision<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:43.200> you're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
got to make a decision when you're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
got to make a decision when you're
running<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> person<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
running up to a person say this is a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.130 
running up to a person say this is a
person<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.270> sorry<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.020> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
person I'm sorry that I had to do this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
person I'm sorry that I had to do this
in<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> private<00:01:46.530> match<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> didn't<00:01:47.280> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
in a private match but I didn't really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
in a private match but I didn't really
have<00:01:47.490> any<00:01:47.759> friends<00:01:47.790> online<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.960> say<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
have any friends online so say this is a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.200 
have any friends online so say this is a
person<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> you're<00:01:50.640> running<00:01:50.729> towards<00:01:51.119> each

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
person and you're running towards each

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
person and you're running towards each
other<00:01:51.329> instead<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.320> panic<00:01:52.770> knifing<00:01:53.159> i

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
other instead of just panic knifing i

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
other instead of just panic knifing i
just<00:01:53.549> press<00:01:53.700> b<00:01:53.939> by<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.990> instead<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just press b by the way so instead of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.020 
just press b by the way so instead of
panic<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> can't<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> anymore

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
panic i think you can't do that anymore

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
panic i think you can't do that anymore
because<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.659> can't<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.990> clench<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
because you can't just clench down on

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
because you can't just clench down on
your<00:01:58.680> controller<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.670> would<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> switch

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
your controller you would have to switch

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.510 
your controller you would have to switch
over<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.439> your<00:02:01.590> b<00:02:01.829> button<00:02:02.070> instead<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
over to the your b button instead of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.440 
over to the your b button instead of
just<00:02:02.670> pressing<00:02:03.000> down<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> right

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
just pressing down on the right

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
just pressing down on the right
thumbstick<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> make<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> decision

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
thumbstick so you got to make a decision

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
thumbstick so you got to make a decision
whether<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.969> strafe<00:02:06.570> over<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> B<00:02:07.200> button

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
whether to strafe over to the B button

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.999 
whether to strafe over to the B button
or<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.610> drop<00:02:09.000> shot<00:02:09.330> now<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.020> prefer<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> drop

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
or to drop shot now I prefer to drop

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
or to drop shot now I prefer to drop
shot<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.849> close<00:02:12.090> encounter

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
shot when I get into a close encounter
