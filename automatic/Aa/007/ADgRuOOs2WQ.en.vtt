00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
like about it it gives it somewhat of a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.330 
like about it it gives it somewhat of a
soft<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:40.340> it's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
soft look you can see right here it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.870 
soft look you can see right here it's
not<00:01:41.640> too<00:01:42.119> thick<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.399> really

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
not too thick but you have to really

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.530 
not too thick but you have to really
really<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.130> pencil<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:48.119> used<00:01:48.390> too

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
really with this pencil not used too

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
really with this pencil not used too
much<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> trick<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> use

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
much that's the trick because if you use

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
much that's the trick because if you use
a<00:01:51.180> lot<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.020> too<00:01:52.200> thick<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
a lot it's going to get too thick and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.139 
a lot it's going to get too thick and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
enough for me it's almost like I

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.780 
enough for me it's almost like I
couldn't<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.959> say

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
couldn't see it so this is I would say

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.729 
couldn't see it so this is I would say
kind<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.849> halfway<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.330> between<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:25.530> not

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
kind of halfway in between it's not

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.910 
kind of halfway in between it's not
quite<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:28.819> striking<00:02:29.819> maybe<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> pencil<00:02:30.930> but

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
quite as striking maybe as a pencil but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.670 
quite as striking maybe as a pencil but
not<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.760> translucent<00:02:33.690> as<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.200> were<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.470> use

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
not as translucent as if you were to use

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.839 
not as translucent as if you were to use
a<00:02:35.040> shadow<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.640> bit

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
a shadow and you can get a little bit

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.270 
a shadow and you can get a little bit
bolder<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> look<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.900> put<00:02:40.349> more<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.950> I
