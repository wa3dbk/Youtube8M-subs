00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.410 
Ford Mondeo and part of the reason for
that<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.039> fact<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.399> steering<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:47.090> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that is the fact that the steering is a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.719 
that is the fact that the steering is a
little<00:01:48.200> bit<00:01:48.350> lifeless<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:49.130> mean<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:49.459> quite

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
little bit lifeless I mean it's quite

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.270 
little bit lifeless I mean it's quite
numb<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:51.110> not<00:01:51.259> very<00:01:51.470> responsive<00:01:52.100> either

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
numb and it's not very responsive either

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.279 
numb and it's not very responsive either
I<00:01:52.459> mean<00:01:52.580> if<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.819> wiggle<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> wheel<00:01:53.690> like<00:01:53.899> that

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
I mean if I wiggle the wheel like that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.300 
I mean if I wiggle the wheel like that
it's<00:01:54.709> not<00:01:54.800> actually<00:01:55.039> really<00:01:55.190> doing<00:01:55.670> anything

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
it's not actually really doing anything

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.279 
it's not actually really doing anything
also<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.819> can<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.300> bit<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.660> pain<00:01:59.899> when

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
also it can be a bit of a pain when

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.979 
also it can be a bit of a pain when
Traverse<00:02:00.739> parking<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.640> town<00:02:02.390> because<00:02:02.780> rear

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
Traverse parking in town because rear

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:14.360 
Traverse parking in town because rear
visibility<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:04.310> really<00:02:04.879> really<00:02:05.239> limited

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.740 

you<00:02:15.370> follow<00:02:15.610> me<00:02:15.760> into<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:15.969> back<00:02:16.269> I'll<00:02:16.689> show

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
you follow me into the back I'll show

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.220 
you follow me into the back I'll show
you<00:02:17.079> another<00:02:17.739> potential<00:02:18.730> problem<00:02:19.230> because

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
you another potential problem because

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.580 
you another potential problem because
while<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.890> decent<00:02:21.879> legroom<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.230> cool

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
while there is decent legroom that cool

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.339 
while there is decent legroom that cool
sloping<00:02:24.280> roofline<00:02:24.579> means<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.109> said<00:02:26.260> it

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
sloping roofline means that if I said it

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.069 
sloping roofline means that if I said it
was<00:02:26.439> straight<00:02:26.680> my<00:02:27.189> head<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:28.329> touching<00:02:28.629> the

was straight my head is touching the

was straight my head is touching the
roof<00:02:29.379> which<00:02:30.159> means<00:02:30.400> ultimately<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.150> car

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
roof which means ultimately this car

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.360 
roof which means ultimately this car
isn't<00:02:31.659> quite<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:31.989> spacious<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.769> back<00:02:33.040> of

isn't quite as spacious in the back of
something<00:02:33.579> more<00:02:33.730> boxy<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.359> Toyota

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
something more boxy like a Toyota

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.229 
something more boxy like a Toyota
Avensis<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.459> fold<00:02:36.819> down<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.060> rear

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
Avensis and if I fold down the rear

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.160 
Avensis and if I fold down the rear
seats<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.879> look<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.359> you'll<00:02:40.959> see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
seats and you look here you'll see

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.470 
seats and you look here you'll see
there's<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:41.470> weird<00:02:42.370> shape<00:02:42.639> step<00:02:43.090> which<00:02:43.299> could

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
there's a weird shape step which could

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
there's a weird shape step which could
get<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:43.959> annoying<00:02:44.319> if<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.739> need<00:02:44.920> to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
get a little bit annoying if you need to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.949 
get a little bit annoying if you need to
carry<00:02:45.250> large<00:02:45.819> flat<00:02:46.329> items<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:49.359> finally

carry large flat items and finally

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.020 
carry large flat items and finally
there's<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.379> matter<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.849> depreciation<00:02:51.849> because

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
there's a matter of depreciation because

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.149 
there's a matter of depreciation because
the<00:02:52.299> insignia<00:02:52.810> won't<00:02:53.290> hold<00:02:53.470> its<00:02:53.680> value<00:02:54.010> as

the insignia won't hold its value as

the insignia won't hold its value as
