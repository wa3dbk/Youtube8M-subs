this sounds familiar you have it's that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.720 
this sounds familiar you have it's that
seventh-grade<00:02:24.620> thing<00:02:24.890> where<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.190> explode<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
seventh-grade thing where you explode a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.660 
seventh-grade thing where you explode a
fake<00:02:26.120> volcano<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.930> probably<00:02:27.860> why<00:02:28.010> my<00:02:28.220> college

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
fake volcano and probably why my college

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.060 
fake volcano and probably why my college
Cape<00:02:28.940> exploded<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.720> added<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.890> batter

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
Cape exploded I added it to the batter

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.060 
Cape exploded I added it to the batter
mixed<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.180> through<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.740> into<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
mixed it through then got it into the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.520 
mixed it through then got it into the
pans<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.670> into<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.570> oven<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:36.020> 20<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.470> 25

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
pans and into the oven for 20 to 25

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.060 
pans and into the oven for 20 to 25
minutes<00:02:37.210> 350<00:02:38.210> degrees<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.590> was<00:02:39.770> all

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
minutes 350 degrees and that was all

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.800 
minutes 350 degrees and that was all
there<00:02:40.250> was<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:41.530> here's<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.620> trick<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.810> little

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
there was to it here's a trick a little

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
there was to it here's a trick a little
frosting<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.500> whatever<00:02:45.890> base<00:02:46.220> your<00:02:46.730> cake<00:02:46.940> is

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
frosting on whatever base your cake is

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120 
frosting on whatever base your cake is
going<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:48.380> going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> hold<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:48.980> place

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
going on it's going to hold it in place

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.199 
going on it's going to hold it in place
so<00:02:50.980> with<00:02:51.980> my<00:02:52.100> mini<00:02:52.310> spat<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
so with my mini spat I'm just going to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.900 
so with my mini spat I'm just going to
start<00:02:53.510> scooping<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.010> icing<00:02:55.489> there's<00:02:55.700> no

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
start scooping on the icing there's no

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.660 
start scooping on the icing there's no
right<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.209> wrong<00:02:56.390> way<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.810> do<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.610> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
right or wrong way to do it just get the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.620 
right or wrong way to do it just get the
right<00:02:58.970> amount

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
right amount

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.110 
right amount
somewhere<00:03:00.290> between<00:03:00.470> not<00:03:01.220> too<00:03:01.489> much<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.970> not

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
somewhere between not too much and not

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.740 
somewhere between not too much and not
too<00:03:02.180> little

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
too little

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.130 
too little
it's<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.650> Goldilocks<00:03:04.420> just<00:03:05.420> right

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
it's like Goldilocks just right

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.979 
it's like Goldilocks just right
okay<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:07.640> layer<00:03:07.820> is<00:03:07.970> finished<00:03:08.300> I'm<00:03:08.630> going<00:03:08.930> to

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
okay this layer is finished I'm going to

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.040 
okay this layer is finished I'm going to
get<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.230> into<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> freezer<00:03:10.600> if<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.810> want<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
get it into the freezer if you want the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.440 
get it into the freezer if you want the
cake<00:03:12.260> perfectly<00:03:12.800> lined<00:03:13.130> up<00:03:13.340> freezing's<00:03:14.300> the

cake perfectly lined up freezing's the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.920 
cake perfectly lined up freezing's the
trick<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:15.350> freeze<00:03:15.680> between<00:03:16.100> each<00:03:16.310> layer<00:03:16.930> then

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
trick you freeze between each layer then

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.750 
trick you freeze between each layer then
when<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.200> three<00:03:18.380> layers<00:03:18.590> are<00:03:18.800> assembled<00:03:19.220> you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
when the three layers are assembled you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.699 
when the three layers are assembled you
do<00:03:19.940> what's<00:03:20.120> called<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.450> crumb<00:03:20.690> coat<00:03:20.930> which
