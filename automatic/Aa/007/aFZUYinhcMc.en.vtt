to just say I the clips are going to be
a<00:00:15.630> little<00:00:15.809> bit<00:00:15.960> shorter<00:00:16.170> today<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> think<00:00:16.770> I'm

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
a little bit shorter today I think I'm

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
a little bit shorter today I think I'm
about<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.039> minute<00:00:17.369> worth<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.970> clips<00:00:18.270> just

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
about a minute worth of clips just

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
about a minute worth of clips just
because<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.590> files<00:00:19.920> corrupt<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.520> me<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.760> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
because I two files corrupt on me so I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240 
because I two files corrupt on me so I
lost<00:00:21.029> two<00:00:21.270> games<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.800> general<00:00:22.830> it's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
lost two games and just in general it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.410 
lost two games and just in general it's
harder<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.699> clips<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.390> back

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
harder to get clips with a right back

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
harder to get clips with a right back
obviously<00:00:25.350> there<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:25.890> find

obviously there you can just find

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
obviously there you can just find
tackles<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.330> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.930> hard<00:00:28.050> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
tackles but it's kind of it's hard to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
tackles but it's kind of it's hard to
find<00:00:28.439> those<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.740> Sony<00:00:28.920> Vegas<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.460> anyway<00:00:29.699> as
