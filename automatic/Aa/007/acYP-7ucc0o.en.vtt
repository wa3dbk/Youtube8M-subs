00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 the high fives were harder on Saturday night 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 and higher than ever a special for tim 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.940
 matavz he squeezed everything in injury time 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.420
 from his body up to the ball 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.070
 come 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.799
 it might be his 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.799
 most important hit in the service of ps 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.680
 there is the laundry important but maybe 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 today can see that we have character 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.470
 when fighting to the toad and so it 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.540
 luckily somebody has the rule once 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.320
 injury time entered there benefited 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.930
 psv 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 Saturday night optimally from child's seconds 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.420
 fit with it on bjÃ¶rn 's clock 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.719
 coopers 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 the explosion of joy was logical place 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.020
 two 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.520
 that now remains insight which means preliminary round 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.480
 champions league also remains feasible 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 like here but that every match 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 respect with such is it as rkc you 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 You should actually go as quickly as possible 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.829
 and this should be another one 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 match where you have another one 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.850
 kind of motivation thing putter 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 only it has been shown more often that we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 not done i'm after such 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 contest 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.590
 yes what do you have any questions 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.210
 plow actually yes if I now have one 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.960
 good reason skin and wash it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.100
 probably not that often happened but 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 I think it's important with the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.130
 last four games ahead 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.780
 that you look ahead and that you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 then every game is going 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.790
 We analyze every match 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.680
 looks at itself and tries every one 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.329
 match again to deliver this from you 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.430
 done today 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.350
 psv with jetro willems the basis for the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.659
 injured erik pieters start well 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 and finally the ball comes to the man 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.970
 that rut rebounded 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.930
 and scored jeremain lens i'm lucky you 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.930
 but what does it matter? 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.510
 yes so it may also call the esteban 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.010
 did not look very good but with that 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.000
 he says handsome per cell with one 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.590
 number of good rescues and yes but mark 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.540
 how it works like everyone else 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.430
 I'm already happy with the opening goal 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.260
 the result was within fifteen minutes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 from an energetic 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 initial phase of psv what within the minute 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.810
 had to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 is this already saving on it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.220
 swipe from labyad 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.069
 I think that's a little scared of that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 us because I am not putting any pressure on it and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.030
 did nothing at all 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.800
 yet az came and how thanks a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.900
 cannonball from lt door 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 was the 1st you have within half an hour 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.370
 such a Sunday shot that you each 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.040
 fantastic in going and another two 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.530
 one that we still get as 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.510
 of course that is of course pillar 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 just as they help by should also be berends 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.140
 just walk on the way to the second 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 hit from az 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.650
 rock hard in the upper corner Tyton no chance 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.409
 [Applause] 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.599
 just before that, the cabbage had a long time 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.799
 made and save on the bet of 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.340
 beerens 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.400
 pretty so multi psv in the match 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.799
 the team of cocu the plan morning and 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 furthermore certainly were 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.480
 options or for this 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.430
 jeremain lens artistic heart in salvation 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.450
 from esteban 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.239
 [Applause] 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.189
 PSV also attacked collectively with 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.959
 left back jetro willems 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.400
 which is the combination with straw man himself 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.310
 intent 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 Strong afterwards gets rid of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.579
 two three opponents come group anyway 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.189
 can swipe but the tires are the case 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.310
 at rest indicated that that one 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.569
 difficult situation therefore sat after it 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.939
 loss against rkc 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.239
 their two lagging behind and house what we 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.709
 the back really had to be a team 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.389
 we can make the mistakes 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.889
 I certainly won't say a second one 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.439
 11 great like ours I could say they 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.180
 but I did see a team for this 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.989
 what wanted until the last second 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.019
 fight for good results 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.629
 okay also opened his change box 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.750
 straw man and mertens to the Matavz side 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.540
 and man is detail there and that grabbed 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.599
 excellent because the team 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.159
 gives new energy and continued to fight 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.199
 or are a team that does not give up and 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.120
 You can also see that in the field that we 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.889
 still in the last bad buy 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.010
 but before the time came the 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.550
 two two beautiful asist of the pie 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.010
 lens pulls out 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.410
 one was lucky 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.410
 2 2 especially very important 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.260
 second was very important 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.700
 goal and gives the team 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.680
 yet the feeling did it anyway 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.120
 never get anything and you see it that way 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.640
 that we continue until the last minute 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560
 knok and finally those three two 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.730
 dragging in the passion not a second min 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.410
 we have scoreboard 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.870
 no, because after the kick-off was immediately 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.800
 jim last played a fantastic 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.630
 rest 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.180
 [Music] 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.060
 he was very present again today 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.520
 and the two and two shoot very many eggs 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.830
 yes fantastic within the equalizer of 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.450
 lens fifteen minutes before time that gave psv 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.490
 even more energy and so tom de de 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.180
 The rich defenders and Hudson's still him 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.850
 but agree with that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.400
 eventually gave lens decisive for 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.100
 put you print the theme taxes larger 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.100
 against the ball 3 2 for PSV 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.560
 hh well i have i have a lot of families now 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.930
 I want to do the shit quickly and if so 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.270
 what they call it a magna 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.860
 yes it will see that then to 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.340
 don't let him keep on fighting 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.590
 that we can make the three two is 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.770
 fantastic sometimes a little bit of luck 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.520
 you want to enforce with passion and 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.520
 play fight 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.840
 both teams were in favor of the wind 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.550
 keep opening it a bit too open 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.960
 for around you and back 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.580
 I do have compliments about the team 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.510
 given for the way they use the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.370
 second half have the radiation passion 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.810
 brought as a team 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.360
 Those three points that are very important 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.490
 especially since you are against direct competitor 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.200
 and now he's just a point 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.320
 back on az and 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.750
 anything is still possible and such 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.000
 with the extra time you make the most of your smile 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.740
 opponent block wood and the ropes and 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.419
 can ps wings look it up 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.140

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.550
 psv matches played over the weekend 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.130
 so Heerenveen wins so do it 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.760
 also feyenoord but fc twente and nac 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.760
 breda 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.560
 play equal in enschede ajax wins with

 three one from the county 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.930
 that then yields the following position 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.650
 the Ajax Premier League alone in the lead 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.690
 with 64 points from 13 games with still 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.169
 to play four games is the gap 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.930
 to the numbers 2 6 points that numbers 2 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.740

 twente 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.730
 share place four with gentlemen 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.130
 they are one point behind that 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.960
 coveted second position 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.120
 the top scorers list of psv will still be 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.220
