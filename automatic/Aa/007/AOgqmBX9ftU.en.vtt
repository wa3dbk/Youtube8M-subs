00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.550 

well<00:00:00.240> the<00:00:00.480> writings<00:00:00.750> been<00:00:00.840> on<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.079> wall<00:00:01.199> for<00:00:01.500> a

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
well the writings been on the wall for a

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.800 
well the writings been on the wall for a
while<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:02.100> fresh<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.460> easy<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.540> think

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
while with fresh and easy and I think

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.869 
while with fresh and easy and I think
there's<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.080> few<00:00:04.259> things<00:00:04.470> here<00:00:05.100> first<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.730> all

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
there's a few things here first of all

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.020 
there's a few things here first of all
the<00:00:06.299> stores<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:08.130> very<00:00:08.189> clinical<00:00:08.790> they're

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the stores are very clinical they're

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.270 
the stores are very clinical they're
very<00:00:09.179> small<00:00:09.540> they're<00:00:09.900> very<00:00:10.230> automated<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
very small they're very automated and I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.100 
very small they're very automated and I
think<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.639> know<00:00:11.759> Tesco<00:00:12.210> try<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> enter<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
think you know Tesco try to enter the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.810 
think you know Tesco try to enter the
u.s.<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.650> revolutionize<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.700> way<00:00:14.790> that

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
u.s. and revolutionize the way that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
u.s. and revolutionize the way that
Americans<00:00:15.389> shop<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.500> really

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
Americans shop but they just really

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.880 
Americans shop but they just really
failed<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> grasp<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.320> another

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
failed to grasp it so I think another

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590 
failed to grasp it so I think another
issue<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.760> fact<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.330> set

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
issue really is the fact that they set

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
issue really is the fact that they set
up<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.869> infrastructure<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:23.189> service

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
up the infrastructure to service

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.269 
up the infrastructure to service
thousands<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.180> these<00:00:24.269> stores<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
thousands of these stores but at the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.859 
thousands of these stores but at the
moment<00:00:26.670> they're<00:00:26.789> still<00:00:27.029> limited<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
moment they're still limited to just a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.670 
moment they're still limited to just a
few<00:00:28.050> hundred

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
few hundred

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
few hundred
so<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.429> stores<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.820> operating<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.480> quite

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so these stores are operating with quite

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.630 
so these stores are operating with quite
a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> overhead<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.460> very

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
a lot of overhead and it's it's very

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060 
a lot of overhead and it's it's very
difficult<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.300> them<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> turn<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> profit<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
difficult for them to turn a profit and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.950 
difficult for them to turn a profit and
so<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.399> why<00:00:35.550> after<00:00:35.820> five<00:00:36.030> years<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so that's why after five years the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.330 
so that's why after five years the
stores<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.350> still<00:00:37.469> hemorrhaging<00:00:37.620> money<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
stores are still hemorrhaging money and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
stores are still hemorrhaging money and
you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> u.s.<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:39.989> extremely

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you know the u.s. is an extremely

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
you know the u.s. is an extremely
competitive<00:00:40.920> market<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:41.940> very

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
competitive market there's some very

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.260 
competitive market there's some very
strong<00:00:42.570> established<00:00:43.320> players<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
strong established players there and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.100 
strong established players there and
unfortunately<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.420> today's<00:00:45.840> news

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
unfortunately I think today's news

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
unfortunately I think today's news
indicates<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.860> Tesco<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.370> inevitably

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
indicates that Tesco will inevitably

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
indicates that Tesco will inevitably
exit<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> market<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.190> they're<00:00:50.460> not

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
exit the market and you know they're not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
exit the market and you know they're not
the<00:00:50.700> only<00:00:50.910> ones<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.329> done<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.660> M&amp;S<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the only ones that have done it M&amp;S and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
the only ones that have done it M&amp;S and
Sainsbury's<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.860> tried<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> crack<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> US

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Sainsbury's have tried to crack the US

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
Sainsbury's have tried to crack the US
but<00:00:54.149> they've<00:00:54.360> had<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> exit<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but they've had to exit as well so I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
but they've had to exit as well so I
think<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.370> we'll<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.910> mentioned

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
think that's what we'll see I mentioned

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.029 
think that's what we'll see I mentioned
there<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> pressure<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.199> Philip<00:00:58.500> Clark<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there the pressure on Philip Clark the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
there the pressure on Philip Clark the
chief<00:00:59.280> executive<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.149> sense<00:01:00.390> though<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
chief executive in a sense though this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.450 
chief executive in a sense though this
fresh<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.469> easy<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> brainchild

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
fresh and easy thing was the brainchild

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.750 
fresh and easy thing was the brainchild
of<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.120> his<00:01:03.629> predecessor<00:01:04.110> Terry<00:01:04.409> lady<00:01:04.760> yes

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
of of his predecessor Terry lady yes

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
of of his predecessor Terry lady yes
that's<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> again<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that's right and again I think that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's right and again I think that
fresh<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> easy<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.720> innovative

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
fresh and easy was it was an innovative

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
fresh and easy was it was an innovative
idea<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> certainly<00:01:11.070> sparked<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
idea and it certainly sparked a lot of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
idea and it certainly sparked a lot of
reaction<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> u.s.<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> look<00:01:14.369> at

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
reaction in the u.s. so if you look at

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
reaction in the u.s. so if you look at
some<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> big<00:01:14.909> competitors<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.600> Walmart

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
some of the big competitors like Walmart

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
some of the big competitors like Walmart
they're<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.680> launching<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.220> chain<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> smaller

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
they're now launching a chain of smaller

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
they're now launching a chain of smaller
stores<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> identified

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
stores and I think they have identified

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.109 
stores and I think they have identified
a<00:01:19.950> gap<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> market<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:20.909> they've<00:01:21.090> just

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a gap in the market but they've just

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
a gap in the market but they've just
really<00:01:21.509> failed<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> deliver<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really failed to deliver on it and you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
really failed to deliver on it and you
know<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.909> news<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> tim<00:01:24.780> mason<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> CEO<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
know the news that tim mason the CEO of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
know the news that tim mason the CEO of
fresh<00:01:26.460> news<00:01:26.729> he<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.210> leaving<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
fresh news he is now leaving the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
fresh news he is now leaving the
business<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:28.740> quite<00:01:29.100> significant

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
business is also quite significant

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
business is also quite significant
because<00:01:30.240> he's<00:01:30.780> he<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.500> also<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> deputy<00:01:32.310> CEO

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
because he's he was also the deputy CEO

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060 
because he's he was also the deputy CEO
of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> entire<00:01:33.060> group<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.710> clear

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of the entire group and a clear

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
of the entire group and a clear
front-runner<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:36.420> Phillips<00:01:36.689> Clark<00:01:36.900> Philip

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
front-runner for Phillips Clark Philip

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
front-runner for Phillips Clark Philip
Clark's<00:01:37.560> job<00:01:37.860> when<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> time<00:01:38.909> comes<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.240> him

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
Clark's job when the time comes for him

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
Clark's job when the time comes for him
to<00:01:39.630> move<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> major

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to move on so I think that the major

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
to move on so I think that the major
implication<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.720> there's<00:01:42.960> no

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
implication here is that now there's no

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.770 
implication here is that now there's no
real<00:01:44.040> line<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> succession<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.450> place

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
real line of succession in place

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.800 
real line of succession in place
particularly<00:01:46.649> now<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> Richard<00:01:48.360> brazier

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
particularly now that Richard brazier

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
particularly now that Richard brazier
who<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> heading<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> UK<00:01:49.680> business<00:01:50.040> has<00:01:50.189> also

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
who is heading the UK business has also

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.270 
who is heading the UK business has also
left<00:01:50.810> look<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.380> tell<00:01:52.500> us<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:53.070> about

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
left look just tell us then a bit about

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
left look just tell us then a bit about
how<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.820> analyze<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.750> position<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.259> Tesco<00:01:55.500> as

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
how you analyze the position of Tesco as

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
how you analyze the position of Tesco as
it<00:01:56.520> stands<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> moment<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.689> still<00:01:57.960> feels

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it stands at the moment it still feels

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.319 
it stands at the moment it still feels
it<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.399> panache<00:02:00.060> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it doesn't quite have that panache that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
it doesn't quite have that panache that
it<00:02:00.420> did<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> few<00:02:00.780> years<00:02:01.020> ago<00:02:01.250> yeah<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.490> right

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
it did a few years ago yeah that's right

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
it did a few years ago yeah that's right
I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:02.880> they've<00:02:03.299> sort<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> lost<00:02:04.049> their<00:02:04.229> way

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I think they've sort of lost their way

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
I think they've sort of lost their way
they've<00:02:05.040> become<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.579> bit<00:02:05.670> complacent

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
they've become a little bit complacent

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.540 
they've become a little bit complacent
in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> UK<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.079> let's<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.770> forget<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
in the UK which let's not forget is the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.790 
in the UK which let's not forget is the
cash<00:02:08.759> cow<00:02:09.060> market<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> UK<00:02:10.170> accounts

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
cash cow market you know the UK accounts

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.210 
cash cow market you know the UK accounts
for<00:02:10.950> two-thirds<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.670> group<00:02:11.879> profits

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
for two-thirds of group profits

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.790 
for two-thirds of group profits
if<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.520> UK<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.120> performing<00:02:14.900> as<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.560> should

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
if the UK is not performing as it should

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.260 
if the UK is not performing as it should
be<00:02:15.950> well<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.310> puts<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.610> lot<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> pressure<00:02:16.970> on

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
be well that puts a lot of pressure on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.570 
be well that puts a lot of pressure on
international<00:02:17.900> operations<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.800> if<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.430> look

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
international operations and if you look

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.340 
international operations and if you look
internationally<00:02:19.940> they<00:02:20.660> have<00:02:20.990> actually

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
internationally they have actually

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.050 
internationally they have actually
reported<00:02:21.800> declines<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.640> like-for-like

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
reported declines and like-for-like

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.840 
reported declines and like-for-like
sales<00:02:23.210> in<00:02:23.780> eight<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.230> their<00:02:24.470> 12<00:02:24.710> markets<00:02:25.280> so

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
sales in eight of their 12 markets so

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.890 
sales in eight of their 12 markets so
you<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.090> see<00:02:26.240> why<00:02:26.360> there's<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.630> lot<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
you can see why there's a lot of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.930 
you can see why there's a lot of
pressure<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.230> Philip<00:02:27.590> Clark<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.340> exit<00:02:28.790> those

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
pressure on Philip Clark to exit those

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.200 
pressure on Philip Clark to exit those
markets<00:02:29.360> where<00:02:29.450> there's<00:02:29.690> no<00:02:29.810> clear<00:02:30.140> sign<00:02:30.440> of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
markets where there's no clear sign of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.090 
markets where there's no clear sign of
improvements<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.360> turning<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> profit<00:02:33.350> they

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
improvements of turning a profit they

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.340 
improvements of turning a profit they
recently<00:02:34.430> exited<00:02:34.940> their<00:02:35.450> Japanese<00:02:35.900> business

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
recently exited their Japanese business

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.920 
recently exited their Japanese business
and<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:37.160> think<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.820> forward<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.840> know

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
and I think going forward you know

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.540 
and I think going forward you know
Tesco's<00:02:39.290> never<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:39.680> been<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.860> flag<00:02:40.100> planter

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
Tesco's never really been a flag planter

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.430 
Tesco's never really been a flag planter
but<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.180> focus<00:02:41.510> will<00:02:41.660> very<00:02:41.870> much<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.110> on

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
but the focus will very much be on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.920 
but the focus will very much be on
fixing<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> UK<00:02:43.390> improving<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.480> quality<00:02:44.600> of
