drop into your project so we'll do just
that<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.720> select<00:01:40.790> our<00:01:41.790> straight<00:01:42.300> be<00:01:42.479> there

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
that if I select our straight be there

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:53.390 
that if I select our straight be there
hit<00:01:45.240> play<00:01:45.740> that's<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> plan<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.190> to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
hit play that's the plan we want to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.820 
hit play that's the plan we want to
extend<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.510> just<00:01:54.810> highlight<00:01:55.590> over<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
extend that we just highlight over the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.719 
extend that we just highlight over the
edge<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.190> drag<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> heart's<00:01:57.869> content

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
edge I drag it out to a heart's content

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
edge I drag it out to a heart's content
we<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.390> mix<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.810> match<00:02:00.930> or

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
we can also see mix and match or

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.219 
we can also see mix and match or
patterns<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.800> perhaps<00:02:02.310> want<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.670> add<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
patterns so perhaps want to add a

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.510 
patterns so perhaps want to add a
sixteenth<00:02:04.229> high<00:02:04.440> hat<00:02:04.680> pattern<00:02:05.010> in<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.280> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
sixteenth high hat pattern in there so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:19.940 
sixteenth high hat pattern in there so
we'll<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.729> take<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.690> end<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:19.260> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
we'll just take it on to the end if we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.540 
we'll just take it on to the end if we
wanted<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.550> change<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> tempo<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.400> do

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
wanted to change the tempo we can do

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.660 
wanted to change the tempo we can do
that<00:02:23.580> once<00:02:23.880> we've<00:02:24.030> dragged<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> loops<00:02:25.050> in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that once we've dragged the loops in

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
that once we've dragged the loops in
just<00:02:26.670> change<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> template<00:02:27.300> 120<00:02:28.230> beats<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
just change the template 120 beats a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.310 
just change the template 120 beats a
minute<00:02:28.680> doesn't<00:02:29.670> quite<00:02:29.790> sink<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:31.050> we

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.610 
the low frequencies on that you can hear
well<00:03:51.930> that's<00:03:52.049> done<00:03:52.319> pull<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.250> back<00:03:53.370> down<00:03:53.519> again

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
well that's done pull it back down again

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.920 
well that's done pull it back down again
same<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> high<00:03:56.100> hat<00:03:56.239> perhaps<00:03:57.239> induce<00:03:57.840> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
same on the high hat perhaps induce a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.900 
same on the high hat perhaps induce a
high<00:03:58.049> frequency<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.889> that<00:04:01.340> bit<00:04:02.340> harsh<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:02.730> you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
high frequency on that bit harsh but you

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:12.640 
high frequency on that bit harsh but you
get<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.060> idea<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:10.639> that's<00:04:11.639> basically

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
get the idea and that's basically

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.750 
get the idea and that's basically
addictive<00:04:13.650> drums<00:04:13.889> loading<00:04:14.310> what<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.489> can<00:04:14.609> do

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
addictive drums loading what you can do

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.840 
addictive drums loading what you can do
with<00:04:14.910> even<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.239> demo<00:04:16.430> but<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.700> for

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
with even the demo but that's for

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.090 
with even the demo but that's for
another<00:04:17.910> day<00:04:18.500> now<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.560> other<00:04:19.769> thing<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.039> was

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
another day now the other thing I was

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.770 
another day now the other thing I was
going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.340> show<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.729> was<00:04:22.340> using<00:04:23.389> audio<00:04:24.389> loops

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
going to show you was using audio loops

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.940 
going to show you was using audio loops
and<00:04:25.289> Reaper<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.010> i<00:04:26.220> get<00:04:26.669> rid<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.820> those<00:04:27.090> i<00:04:27.950> put

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
and Reaper so i get rid of those i put

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.460 
and Reaper so i get rid of those i put
that<00:04:29.100> back<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.460> 100<00:04:30.120> get<00:04:30.690> rid<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.990> looping

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
that back to 100 get rid of that looping

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:40.879 
that back to 100 get rid of that looping

loops<00:04:45.110> which<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.889> basically<00:04:47.070> using<00:04:47.490> the

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
loops which you can basically using the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.980 
loops which you can basically using the
same<00:04:47.729> way<00:04:47.880> as<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.030> media<00:04:48.300> loops<00:04:48.479> except<00:04:48.810> their

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
same way as the media loops except their

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.190 
same way as the media loops except their
audio

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.910 

just<00:04:54.200> audition<00:04:54.620> one<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.830> those<00:04:56.590> that's<00:04:57.590> fine

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
just audition one of those that's fine

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.810 
just audition one of those that's fine
going<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.430> drag<00:04:58.640> that<00:04:58.670> into<00:04:58.850> our<00:04:59.180> project<00:04:59.840> and

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
going to drag that into our project and

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.700 
going to drag that into our project and
then<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.940> shows<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.300> not<00:05:02.600> as<00:05:02.780> individual<00:05:03.500> hits

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
then it shows up not as individual hits

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.540 
then it shows up not as individual hits
but<00:05:04.040> as<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.880> audio<00:05:05.620> track<00:05:06.620> run<00:05:07.360> waveform<00:05:09.550> so

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
but as the audio track run waveform so

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:22.570 
but as the audio track run waveform so
we<00:05:10.640> can<00:05:10.790> play<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:21.040> sounds<00:05:22.040> pretty<00:05:22.190> good<00:05:22.400> now

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
we can play that sounds pretty good now

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.010 
we can play that sounds pretty good now
the<00:05:22.640> one<00:05:22.880> thing<00:05:23.030> got<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.300> be<00:05:23.390> sure<00:05:23.630> off<00:05:23.840> if

the one thing got to be sure off if
you're<00:05:24.200> going<00:05:24.290> to<00:05:24.350> do<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:24.650> in<00:05:24.710> Reaper<00:05:25.280> is

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
you're going to do this in Reaper is

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.020 
you're going to do this in Reaper is
that<00:05:25.850> you<00:05:27.040> make<00:05:28.040> sure<00:05:28.220> your<00:05:28.400> project<00:05:28.820> settings

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
that you make sure your project settings

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.820 
that you make sure your project settings
are<00:05:29.300> right<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.690> your<00:05:29.810> project<00:05:30.230> settings<00:05:30.410> need

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
are right and your project settings need

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.300 
are right and your project settings need
to<00:05:30.980> say<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:32.720> your<00:05:32.840> time<00:05:33.110> base<00:05:33.350> is<00:05:33.680> not<00:05:34.010> time

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
to say that your time base is not time

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.310 
to say that your time base is not time
it<00:05:34.670> is<00:05:34.970> beats<00:05:36.520> then<00:05:37.750> if<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.900> want<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.110> change

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
it is beats then if you want to change

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.820 
it is beats then if you want to change
the<00:05:39.410> tempo<00:05:44.200> automatically<00:05:45.200> syncs<00:05:45.530> that<00:05:45.680> to

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
the tempo automatically syncs that to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:57.910 
the tempo automatically syncs that to
the<00:05:45.950> current<00:05:46.460> tempo<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.870> can<00:05:56.990> also<00:05:57.110> cut<00:05:57.830> and

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
the current tempo you can also cut and

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920 
the current tempo you can also cut and
paste<00:05:58.130> any<00:05:58.490> part<00:05:58.790> of<00:05:58.850> this<00:05:58.970> loop<00:05:59.210> or<00:05:59.450> all<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.660> it

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
paste any part of this loop or all of it

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
paste any part of this loop or all of it
we<00:06:00.260> can<00:06:00.410> drag<00:06:00.620> it<00:06:00.650> out<00:06:00.920> same<00:06:01.670> as<00:06:01.790> a<00:06:01.850> midi<00:06:02.000> loops

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
we can drag it out same as a midi loops

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.670 
we can drag it out same as a midi loops
to<00:06:03.950> extend<00:06:04.310> it<00:06:04.460> or<00:06:05.330> we<00:06:05.450> can<00:06:05.720> highlight<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.350> part

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
to extend it or we can highlight a part

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.060 
to extend it or we can highlight a part
of<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.980> will<00:06:07.160> hire<00:06:07.340> this<00:06:07.490> phil<00:06:07.850> and<00:06:08.770> we<00:06:09.770> will

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
of it will hire this phil and we will

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.130 
of it will hire this phil and we will
copy<00:06:10.730> a<00:06:11.180> loop<00:06:11.750> i<00:06:12.850> will<00:06:13.850> copy<00:06:14.030> selected<00:06:14.600> area<00:06:14.930> of

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
copy a loop i will copy selected area of

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.360 
copy a loop i will copy selected area of
selected<00:06:15.560> items<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:18.710> then<00:06:19.690> we<00:06:20.690> will<00:06:21.370> paste

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
selected items and then we will paste

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.460 
selected items and then we will paste
that<00:06:22.670> so<00:06:23.390> we<00:06:23.510> should<00:06:23.540> then<00:06:23.810> have<00:06:23.840> two<00:06:24.110> fields

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
that so we should then have two fields

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:36.570 
that so we should then have two fields
at<00:06:24.560> the<00:06:24.590> end<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.830> that<00:06:24.950> beat

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.900 

okay<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.640> also<00:06:38.030> add<00:06:38.470> different<00:06:39.670> loops<00:06:40.670> in

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
okay you also add different loops in

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.360 
okay you also add different loops in
that's<00:06:41.060> no<00:06:41.210> problem<00:06:44.620> move<00:06:45.620> seamlessly<00:06:45.950> from

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
that's no problem move seamlessly from

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:58.690 
that's no problem move seamlessly from
one<00:06:46.550> to<00:06:46.670> the<00:06:46.700> other<00:06:56.260> pretty<00:06:57.260> cool<00:06:57.490> okay<00:06:58.490> that's

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
one to the other pretty cool okay that's

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.080 
one to the other pretty cool okay that's
basic<00:06:59.180> addictive<00:06:59.570> drums<00:06:59.810> and<00:07:00.200> audio<00:07:00.710> loops<00:07:01.090> in

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
basic addictive drums and audio loops in

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.800 
basic addictive drums and audio loops in
