00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.990
 depart burner 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.680
 make like 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.820
 soss 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.830
 so that over the can be another 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.600
 you born 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 between fern pick up normal y 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 us 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.920
 the minimum fire is still in mode 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.920
 expectations 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.240
 out of 5 plus small modes again 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.989
 something like this but from automatics 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.460
 here we just have an emergency unit 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.199
 there is if the temperature drops below 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.019
 given critical then the whole system here 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.149
 it turns off 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.220
 all this is the power standard but 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.229
 slightly converted there from 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.250
 adjusting the minimum speed 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:12.670
 the engine here is wound you apart 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 secondary wisely and everything is governed by turns 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.210
 engine 1 less less less 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.310
 all this for 5 years 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.680
 here I had to put an extra 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.960
 score 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 voltage regulator to lower 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 a little transformer because it was 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.170
 another engine simple zhigulevsk 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.790
 and he had enough janitor but this one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.220
 more resourceful need vice versa less 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.760
 voltage and why so done because 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 what is man working out 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.850
 too liquid that is there is actually 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.200
 pp oil and kerosene diesel 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 so here is just the mother process is worth 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 before the air supply 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 here at the same time we serve a straw 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:19.610
 this is the minimum of fuel dripping 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.610
 now quietly here you can see 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980
 a little bit 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.200
 everything 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 and here it is already outdated that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.140
 inside can be served 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.000
 could even in this little window all the pipe in 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.970
 the pipe this pipe goes in the middle 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.970
 not until the end of 20 centimeters without reaching 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.970
 his 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.540
 finished pale lips 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.600
 and everything is a regulator 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.420
 minimum fan speed is 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.210
 need to when out 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.980
 you adjust the small mode up 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.600
 less fuel and less rpm 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 When the output is made the desired mode 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.830
 momentum themselves themselves past it 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.300
 everything passes directly 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.300
 on the fan for a long time 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.180
 and everything and fuel to full flow 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.110
 it turns out 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.840
 and the air is full that is approximately in 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.640
 the office is on the floor of course strongly stove 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.640
 very huge flame 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.850
 like this 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.680
 let's say here I tried to put 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.140
 a photo 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.550
 relay but it did not go apparently either this 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.030
 they cost correctly either 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.500
 you will need to buy again for 100 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.780
 rubles worth and just rewire 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.240
 additional role that put and all 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.220
 so that it works the other way around 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.220
 Basically there is a court that it will stand 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.069
 view light 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.930
 2 review 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.939
 ok it will react about 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.109
 that is, you can do without it 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.260
 control unit 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:17.859
 it just answers the whole system once all 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.859
 turned off the strip like that 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.830
 now I think you should already have a look 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.060
 that we have a stove stove just inside and 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.940
 here's a pipe cut 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.880
 through the water shirt us almost everything if 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.480
 let's say there were were 2 doors 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 you can do there indifferent though 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.630
 already 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.390
 memory 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.280
 of course 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.210
 very sick 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.330
 reduce here 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.810
 but in principle 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.629
 from regulate revolutions here these here i 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.500
 it also reacts as little as 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.530
 high revs 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.020
 given that is, you can ask less 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.720
 turns 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.889
 this one usually works on the contrary 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.770
 the arrow you add here is the opposite 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.819
 decrease clockwise the same 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.740
 the most that you 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.430
 but this is for this block 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.430
 of management 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.460
 here someone launched 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.090
 boiler temperature now 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.090
 options 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.750
 degrees as we ask such will be us 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.310
 here is not necessary so much room 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.030
 now ok here is the garage 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.370
 garage wall 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.090
 This is insulated very badly in the regiment 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.550
 here it is on the cinder block 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.719
 outside the village but at the same time we are calm when 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.689
 40 liters per day was typed right now at 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:53.339
 we just pot drip apparently there 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.899
 factory marriage made as well as 2 degrees 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.989
 stable was no longer given 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:00.089
 water temperature was 60 degrees all 

00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:03.329
 it's so easy just in case 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:06.360
 oil will not be very this is all boiler then 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.969
 there is this this does not apply here all 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.020
 oil system 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:15.699
 still consider the minimum they are now 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.390
 you become a little bit smaller then what 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.250
 leave 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.500
 lantern which were at high speeds 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.840
 and all aligned again 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.950
 and like this principle in any stove can 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:30.220
 paste transferred water temperature 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.050
 it was 60 degrees all this so simple 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.100
 just in case a sudden oil will not have 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.030
 man's all the boiler that is it to this 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.270
 the whole oil system doesn't apply 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.930
 still consider the minimum can 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.930
 tilt
