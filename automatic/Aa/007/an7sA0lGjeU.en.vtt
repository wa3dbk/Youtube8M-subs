to be cryogenic or flame or you know

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.580 
to be cryogenic or flame or you know
like<00:02:46.349> Aunt<00:02:46.590> iia<00:02:47.540> very<00:02:48.540> cool<00:02:48.840> stuff<00:02:49.109> so<00:02:49.349> now<00:02:49.530> you

then<00:03:51.479> now<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.169> to<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.349> skills<00:03:52.709> i<00:03:52.859> got<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
then now on to the skills i got as a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.189 
then now on to the skills i got as a
center<00:03:53.579> very<00:03:54.239> cool<00:03:54.479> stuff<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:54.930> as<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.139> said

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
center very cool stuff so as I said

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.990 
center very cool stuff so as I said
there's<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> century<00:03:56.040> now<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.220> basically<00:03:56.579> you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
there's a century now and basically you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.539 
there's a century now and basically you
project<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.989> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.319> like<00:03:58.549> holographic

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
project this kind of like holographic

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.119 
project this kind of like holographic
projector<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.419> bam<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> holographic

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
projector and bam you have a holographic

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.849 
projector and bam you have a holographic
century<00:04:02.909> that<00:04:03.540> shoots<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> people<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.590> and

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
century that shoots the people like and

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.409 
century that shoots the people like and
you<00:04:04.919> can<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.609> through<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.000> actually

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
you can you can through it actually

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.080 
you can you can through it actually
among<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.470> animes<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:08.159> it's<00:04:08.579> great<00:04:08.790> for

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
among the animes so it's great for

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.330 
among the animes so it's great for
strategy<00:04:09.599> because<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.290> scatters<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
strategy because like it scatters the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.140 
strategy because like it scatters the
the<00:04:12.030> guys<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:12.569> pretty<00:04:13.290> cool<00:04:13.530> stuff<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:14.159> hope

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
the guys around pretty cool stuff I hope

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.610 
the guys around pretty cool stuff I hope
you<00:04:15.239> guys<00:04:15.359> are<00:04:15.629> not<00:04:15.750> fully<00:04:15.989> bombing<00:04:16.349> me<00:04:16.500> or

whatever so pretty cool stuff now garrus
also<00:04:22.169> had<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.530> landmine<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.340> he<00:04:23.430> can<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:23.729> burn

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
also had a landmine so he can just burn

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.690 
also had a landmine so he can just burn
landmine<00:04:24.419> into<00:04:24.630> battle<00:04:24.930> fail<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.349> bam<00:04:25.700> pretty

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
landmine into battle fail and bam pretty

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.310 
landmine into battle fail and bam pretty
cool<00:04:26.909> stuff<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.360> also<00:04:27.510> had<00:04:27.779> like<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.960> quite

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
pieces really really cool stuff um also

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.950 
pieces really really cool stuff um also
had<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.340> they<00:04:41.940> tweaked<00:04:42.420> like<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> special

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
had like they tweaked like the special

had like they tweaked like the special
effect<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> singularity<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.820> want

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
effect like in the singularity I want

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.240 
effect like in the singularity I want
you<00:04:46.800> can<00:04:46.950> have<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.350> can<00:04:49.470> steal<00:04:49.680> sabotage

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
people so really really fast based

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.910 
people so really really fast based
combat<00:04:53.940> even<00:04:54.450> more<00:04:54.690> polished<00:04:55.200> than<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.740> one

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
combat even more polished than the one

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.670 
combat even more polished than the one
in<00:04:56.040> mass<00:04:56.190> effect<00:04:56.610> two<00:04:57.140> very<00:04:58.140> very<00:04:58.260> much

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
in mass effect two very very much

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.380 
in mass effect two very very much
looking<00:04:59.100> forward<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.760> one<00:05:00.060> especially

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
looking forward to this one especially

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.640 
looking forward to this one especially
since<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.930> story<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.290> going<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.440> be<00:05:01.530> awesome

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
since the story is going to be awesome

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.690 
since the story is going to be awesome
that's<00:05:02.070> why<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.250> play<00:05:02.430> mass<00:05:02.669> effect

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
that's why you play mass effect

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.670 
that's why you play mass effect
originally<00:05:03.360> but<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.870> polished<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.380> combat

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
originally but it polished a combat

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.970 
originally but it polished a combat
system<00:05:05.100> even<00:05:05.400> more<00:05:05.640> it's<00:05:06.300> more<00:05:06.810> strategic<00:05:07.470> but

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
system even more it's more strategic but

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.420 
system even more it's more strategic but
also<00:05:08.190> more<00:05:08.550> fast-paced<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.560> more<00:05:10.560> person<00:05:11.100> and

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
also more fast-paced and more person and

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.970 
also more fast-paced and more person and
there's<00:05:11.820> more<00:05:12.030> customization<00:05:12.900> what<00:05:13.800> else

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
there's more customization what else

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.560 
there's more customization what else
could<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.160> ask<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.550> mass<00:05:14.940> effect<00:05:15.300> 3<00:05:15.510> is

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
could you ask for mass effect 3 is

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.900 
could you ask for mass effect 3 is
coming<00:05:15.840> up<00:05:15.990> later<00:05:16.710> this<00:05:16.860> year<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.790> I'm

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
coming up later this year so I'm

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.530 
coming up later this year so I'm
definitely<00:05:18.030> looking<00:05:18.360> forward<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.020> huh
