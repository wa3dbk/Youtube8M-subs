00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.610
 kay hello everyone like we just 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.930
 figured out the previous lesson or maybe 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.520
 not only that may well be to 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.809
 watched the previous lesson a week ago but 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.769
 nevertheless as we explained in 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.250
 previous lesson 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 the colors we add in the lightroom 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.390
 pupils are mixed and if I want 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.939
 take my purebred blue 220 groin and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.660
 after that I'll take the red 360 groin june 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.040
 30 it does not matter and add and mix them then 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.989
 finally get 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.370
 anything but red and blue 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.989
 especial go will raspberry not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.809
 I know in general how it is a terrible thing here 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.469
 will be and this is the first thing that we need 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.870
 remember 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.579
 colors are always mixed so if 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 Our image has some 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.050
 parasitic tint or there is some 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.089
 color and top in something cover the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.679
 you must always remember that they will 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.199
 mix and need to make 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.089
 some adjustments let's see 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.719
 this thesis on the example of some 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.210
 photos 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.890
 we have a secret military here 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.780
 Kazakh base which we 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.460
 photographed in the winter on a very bad 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.850
 camera so everything is very strong 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.430
 makes a noise 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.759
 but no matter how you can learn from 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.860
 any color correction books 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.540
 maximum volumes do not look alone 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.380
 and the same colors in the colors and in the shadows and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.250
 some colors of the color transition that is 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.290
 transition from light blue to blue i 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.590
 summer you have it you look enough 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.180
 volumetric action walk it will be possible 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.939
 check it out then on the gradient 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 take the same color and stuff 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.030
 his and in shadow and light and then compare 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.360
 this 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 let us do it now in a barrel not 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 got copy it here then add 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.009
 instead of blue 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.329
 purple shadows here here are more blue 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.189
 In this case, this thing will look 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.710
 much more voluminous variety 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.380
 blue colors of the purple canopy than 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.789
 just the same color 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.219
 accordingly, if we catch this photo 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.860
 then you can easily notice determine 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.660
 which is not a parasitic color of course although in 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.170
 Generally would call it parasitic but 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.430
 dominant color on this and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.200
 fermentation so greenish bluish 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.660
 prices it will be understandable well si lead 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.130
 pipette and poke somewhere pictures 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.440
 will be gray and in general it will be 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.630
 absolutely not interesting to us and to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.640
 Sorry to do something super mega 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.060
 creative impossible for that simple 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.040
 reason that overall she is already dull boring 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.500
 and accordingly I will return the same 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.330
 color shade that was made when 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.269
 shooting i have returned the white balance to 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.470
 I will need a starting position split 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.300
 toning to somehow 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.100
 diversify this image because 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.920
 white balance will change all colors 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.410
 the whole image considering what it is 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.180
 low key image i want 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340
 paint in some shade and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.530
 accordingly I put that color in mediums 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.380
 which is the shadow I want to paint in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.630
 blue on but if i take blue normal 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.390
 water in the shadows and this is here from exactly 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.819
 in the middle of the blue start to add it then 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.400
 the whole image is enrolled and in general 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.390
 this is obvious and logical given that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.370
 us low key 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.230
 I will need to take the balance and start 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.880
 twist it in one side as you 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.700
 guess twist need to be right 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.470
 but if you are suddenly confused where 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 you need to twist it, you can hold the button 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.120
 alt click on the balance you will see where 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.859
 some color will be added as 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.079
 see most of the photos now 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.760
 blue colored smaller part 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.519
 colored red red because 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.239
 here we have oink 0 blue because 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.000
 here is x 240 for some reason let's 220 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.250
 put okay accordingly i pinch 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.530
 alter balance and starts moving to the right 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.049
 until the whole image is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.910
 gaze to the right is such an incomprehensible 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.829
 letting go a little advice after 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.260
 you let go of alt and generally 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.600
 used the balance slider when 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.579
 hold alt and highly recommend 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.019
 give my eyes some rest i better 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.310
 just even turn off the stove alenka 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.140
 look at the image of who she was 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.780
 just because it's overrun 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.970
 image especially if you work 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.920
 tired go at night very hard 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.620
 eyes and you harder significantly 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.239
 perceive colors will be just that 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.269
 this way if i want my his 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.169
 the image was 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.360
 rather blue than green then i need 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.370
 will take for the kind of knowingly more 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.370
 purple color i.e. shift to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.009
 here's the red side 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.569
 right and my balance should be 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.240
 accordingly, also slightly removed 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.159
 right considering that I have a photo 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.810
 in low key 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.210
 in this way so adjust 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.460
 saturation so i have 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.099
 turned out to be quite an interesting color 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.470
 Palette in the highlights I have such and 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.800
 a greenish bluish pale tint in 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.229
 my shadows are pretty saturated blue 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.509
 if we tried to do this on 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.509
 our scheme, we would not 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.449
 we have something like this image 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.639
 apart from the fact that this gradient 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:15.849
 lighter if I cut off both white 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.710
 part about this palette here 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.389
 in this image like this 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.169
 gradient 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.240
 the only thing again is that we don't have 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.919
 such dark colors such saturated by 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.400
 This site can be solved schools 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.400
 reduce 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.849
 Well, I think this is all that 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.060
 it was necessary today to find out that this is not 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.770
 only the colors from the media are thinly mixed with 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.900
 each other but colors in general 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.110
 filters are mixed in the next lesson 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.789
 we'll see how we can see 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.750
 handle portrait using the same 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.750
 most knowledge
