that I hope that you guys continue to
chip<00:04:04.230> away<00:04:04.260> at<00:04:05.160> your<00:04:05.640> channel<00:04:06.270> especially<00:04:06.720> if

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
chip away at your channel especially if

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.060 
chip away at your channel especially if
you're<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.990> beginner<00:04:07.080> I'm<00:04:07.620> going<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.860> try<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
you're a beginner I'm going to try to

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.620 
you're a beginner I'm going to try to
put<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> little<00:04:08.550> bit<00:04:08.730> more<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:08.970> these<00:04:09.090> videos<00:04:09.120> up

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
put a little bit more of these videos up

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.060 
put a little bit more of these videos up
a<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:10.020> bit<00:04:10.110> more<00:04:10.260> often<00:04:10.650> because<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:11.010> think

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
a little bit more often because I think

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.070 
a little bit more often because I think
they<00:04:11.400> can't<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> little<00:04:11.910> helpful<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.900> then

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
they can't be a little helpful so then

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.390 
they can't be a little helpful so then
that<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.320> hope<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.680> guys<00:04:13.830> enjoyed<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.220> video
