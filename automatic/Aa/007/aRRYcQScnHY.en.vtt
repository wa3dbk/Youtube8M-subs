00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.960
Hello and welcome to Rooster Teeth Production's Production Studios

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.440
content that you see on the internet every day.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.040
I'm going to take a tour of the studio, and I thought that you would like to come along.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.460

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.700
We produce some of the top quality, [to himself] fuck, okay, wait, go back

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820
And our first stop is going to be, the place where we record the Drunk Tank Podcast

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.620
It is one of the most popular podcasts in the whole world

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.760
It's number one video podcast in video game and number thirty overall on iTunes

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.980
But, now that... now that NPR has been defunded, the sky is the limit

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.020
The Drunk Tank is led by our Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Gustavo Zorolo

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.400
Gus: "I told you you have to pay me on the first of the month, not the second not the third."

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.400
Man: "Hey man my car just broke down and I'm tryin to get my pregnant wife to the hospital"

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.820
You think he looked sick?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.900
Okay and now let's go next door and see our state-of-the-art facility where we create the informational video game show

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.420

And this is our state-of-the-art studio

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.360
Where we produced Immersion

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.420
Also many RT Shorts are made, in this very studio.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.340
And over there is Griffon, who writes our RT Comic and also creates all of our props and sets.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.500
Griffon: Is that it?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.260
Burnie: I'm great!

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.100
And this is our green screen

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.240
Due to budget cuts and the rising crude oil prices we couldn't afford to plaint a-

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.440
We couldn't afford to paint a blue screen

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
But we can make it blue, thanks to the miracle of...

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.940
