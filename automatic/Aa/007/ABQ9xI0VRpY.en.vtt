would<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.700> need<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.000> much<00:03:06.180> space<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.569> that

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659

unless you wanted your defensive mids to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.649 
unless you wanted your defensive mids to
really<00:03:11.159> push<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.849> bomb<00:03:12.120> forward<00:03:12.480> but

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.509 
really push on and bomb forward but
other<00:03:12.930> than<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.290> there's<00:03:13.739> really<00:03:13.800> no<00:03:14.099> point

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
other than that there's really no point

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.820 
other than that there's really no point
