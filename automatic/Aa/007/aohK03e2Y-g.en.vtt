kind of going going in the 335 came out

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.069 
kind of going going in the 335 came out
in<00:02:03.390> 1958<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> wasn't<00:02:05.610> until<00:02:05.850> 1959<00:02:06.689> they

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
in 1958 and it wasn't until 1959 they

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.740 
in 1958 and it wasn't until 1959 they
decided<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> lose<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> center<00:02:08.310> block<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> put

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
decided to lose the center block and put

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960 
decided to lose the center block and put
p90s<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:11.400> something<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:11.819> bit

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
p90s in it and do something a little bit

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.160 
p90s in it and do something a little bit
different<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
different with the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
different with the
with<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> 335<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> derived<00:02:15.210> from

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
with the 335 so it kind of derived from

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.730 
with the 335 so it kind of derived from
the<00:02:15.780> 335<00:02:17.240> but<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.110> guitar<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.470> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the 335 but it's just a guitar that we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.130 
the 335 but it's just a guitar that we
haven't<00:02:20.040> built<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.569> since<00:02:21.569> those<00:02:21.810> years

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
haven't built in since those years

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.190 
haven't built in since those years
historically<00:02:22.830> correct<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.580> fact<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
historically correct for that fact so it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
historically correct for that fact so it
just<00:02:25.380> made<00:02:25.560> sense<00:02:25.590> at<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.010> time<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.730> had

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
just made sense at the time and we had

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
just made sense at the time and we had
the<00:02:27.060> right<00:02:27.240> skill<00:02:27.540> set<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.020> right<00:02:28.170> people

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
on board to to pull it off you know it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.800 
on board to to pull it off you know it
takes<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.740> high<00:02:31.920> skill<00:02:32.250> level<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> type

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
takes a high skill level to do this type

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.900 
takes a high skill level to do this type
of<00:02:33.840> thing<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.380> got<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.740> vos<00:02:35.160> finished<00:02:35.580> all

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
the hardware's aged and that takes a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.979 
the hardware's aged and that takes a
skill<00:02:38.340> set<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.760> finding<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.840> people

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989

something<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> off<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.860> takes<00:02:44.040> time

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
something like this off just takes time

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.670 
something like this off just takes time
to<00:02:44.459> develop<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.390> timing<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:45.870> right<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to develop so the timing was right the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
to develop so the timing was right the
market<00:02:47.070> was<00:02:47.190> ripe<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:47.970> once<00:02:48.600> again

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
market was ripe for it and once again
