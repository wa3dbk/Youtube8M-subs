usually<00:00:07.680> crowded<00:00:08.099> around<00:00:08.460> more<00:00:08.970> Fran<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
usually crowded around more Fran and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660 
usually crowded around more Fran and
that's<00:00:09.929> where<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> mainly<00:00:10.950> kill<00:00:11.130> them<00:00:11.280> there's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
that's where I mainly kill them there's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.770 
that's where I mainly kill them there's
another<00:00:11.880> spot<00:00:12.150> where<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.509> kill<00:00:12.660> them

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
another spot where you can kill them

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.089 
another spot where you can kill them
right<00:00:13.019> by<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.320> entrance<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> eye<00:00:14.009> or

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
right by the entrance of the eye or

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.980 
right by the entrance of the eye or
where<00:00:14.309> there's<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> few<00:00:14.969> over<00:00:15.000> there<00:00:15.360> too<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
where there's a few over there too but I

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.630 
where there's a few over there too but I
decided<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.590> kill<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.949> more<00:00:17.160> van<00:00:17.369> area

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
decided to kill at the more van area

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.980 
decided to kill at the more van area
because<00:00:17.970> they're<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.539> compact

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
because they're a little bit compact

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420 
because they're a little bit compact
there<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> lure<00:00:20.010> them<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
there and you can kind of lure them in

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.040 
there and you can kind of lure them in
the<00:00:20.520> middle<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.630> four<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the middle and you have like four to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
the middle and you have like four to
five<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.470> kill<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.279> these<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> male<00:00:24.060> ears

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
five to kill so these are the male ears

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
five to kill so these are the male ears
I<00:00:24.480> did<00:00:24.660> make<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> video<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> while<00:00:25.650> ago<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I did make a video a while ago of the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.640 
I did make a video a while ago of the
Rangers<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.210> they're<00:00:27.930> pretty<00:00:28.170> similar<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
Rangers and they're pretty similar I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.960 
Rangers and they're pretty similar I
mean<00:00:28.890> there's<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
mean there's not really that much of a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
mean there's not really that much of a
difference<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.570> than<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.289> your

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
difference other than you know your

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.350 
difference other than you know your
combat<00:00:31.949> style<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.399> use<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.149> their

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
combat style you use and then their

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
combat style you use and then their
drops<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.930> slightly<00:00:34.260> different

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
drops are slightly different

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.350 
drops are slightly different
speaking<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> drops<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.940> rune<00:00:36.120> plate

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
speaking of drops they have rune plate

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
speaking of drops they have rune plate
bodies<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.079> Rin<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.680> h's<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.460> also

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
bodies and Rin two h's and they also

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.790 
bodies and Rin two h's and they also
drop<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> lot<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.450> coins<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> spring<00:00:40.559> cleaner

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
drop a lot of coins so a spring cleaner

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
drop a lot of coins so a spring cleaner
is<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.219> viable<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.360> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
is pretty viable here and that's for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
is pretty viable here and that's for
gear<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> use<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.350> staff<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> my

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
gear I use not your staff and my

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.680 
gear I use not your staff and my
subjugation<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.629> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
subjugation you don't really need that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.290 
subjugation you don't really need that
much<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.289> than<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.610> use

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
much more than that here and I also use

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
much more than that here and I also use
my<00:00:48.539> slayer<00:00:48.809> helm<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> task<00:00:49.829> for

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
my slayer helm because I was on task for

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
my slayer helm because I was on task for
pretty<00:00:50.250> much<00:00:50.370> every<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.059> these<00:00:51.239> kills<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
pretty much every one of these kills I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
pretty much every one of these kills I
just<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> did<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> slowly<00:00:53.430> through

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just kind of did it slowly through

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
just kind of did it slowly through
Slayer<00:00:54.120> yeah<00:00:54.750> they're<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> mean<00:00:54.989> they're<00:00:55.140> one

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
Slayer yeah they're I mean they're one

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
Slayer yeah they're I mean they're one
of<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.649> favorite<00:00:55.949> tasks<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
of my favorite tasks because like you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
of my favorite tasks because like you
can<00:00:57.239> kill<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> 330<00:00:58.350> per<00:00:58.559> hour<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.980> least<00:00:59.070> at

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
can kill like 330 per hour at least at

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.979 
can kill like 330 per hour at least at
my<00:00:59.399> rate<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> maybe<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.809> bit

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
my rate you can maybe go a little bit

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
my rate you can maybe go a little bit
faster<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.609> how<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
faster but you know that's just how I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
faster but you know that's just how I
got<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> took<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.780> roughly<00:01:04.170> three

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
got it so it took like roughly three

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.620 
got it so it took like roughly three
hours<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> loot<00:01:05.430> video<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.330> only

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
hours to do this loot video and the only

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.700 
hours to do this loot video and the only
thing<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> worry<00:01:07.619> about

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
thing you really have to worry about

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.740 
thing you really have to worry about
here<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.580> stun<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> every<00:01:09.630> now

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
here is that they do stun you every now

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
here is that they do stun you every now
and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.590> use<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> lot<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and then so I would use a lot of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
and then so I would use a lot of
anticipation<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.060> freedom<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
anticipation and freedom just so you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
anticipation and freedom just so you
don't<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.920> stunned<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> when

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
don't get stunned all the time and when

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
don't get stunned all the time and when
you're<00:01:15.090> stunned<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.479> seem<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.320> more

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you're stunned they seem to have more

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.410 
you're stunned they seem to have more
damage<00:01:16.890> maybe<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.119> get

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
damage maybe they don't but you just get

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
damage maybe they don't but you just get

this<00:02:44.129> is<00:02:44.250> probably<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.790> fourth<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.720> my<00:02:45.900> entire

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this is probably a fourth of my entire

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.759 
this is probably a fourth of my entire
loot<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:47.010> drop<00:02:47.250> either<00:02:47.400> 8<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:47.730> 12<00:02:48.239> K<00:02:48.569> GP<00:02:49.530> in

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
loot they drop either 8 or 12 K GP in

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.800 
loot they drop either 8 or 12 K GP in
one<00:02:50.069> drop<00:02:50.370> every<00:02:50.760> time<00:02:50.879> they<00:02:51.000> drop<00:02:51.209> coins<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
one drop every time they drop coins so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.960 
one drop every time they drop coins so
don't<00:02:52.139> like<00:02:52.739> skip<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.159> coin<00:02:53.370> drops<00:02:53.609> because

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
don't like skip the coin drops because

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.819 
don't like skip the coin drops because
just<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.389> thousand<00:02:54.780> kills<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.200> got<00:02:55.680> two

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
just in the thousand kills I got two

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.319 
just in the thousand kills I got two
point<00:02:56.010> five<00:02:56.159> mil<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.639> that's<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.030> know<00:02:57.090> only

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
point five mil and that's you know only

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.539 
point five mil and that's you know only
like<00:02:57.540> five<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.170> six<00:02:58.439> tasks<00:02:58.950> worth<00:02:59.159> so<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
like five to six tasks worth so it's

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.360 
like five to six tasks worth so it's
like<00:02:59.670> 500k<00:03:00.269> coins<00:03:00.959> per<00:03:01.260> task<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.889> you<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.220> it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
like 500k coins per task so you know it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.949 
like 500k coins per task so you know it
really<00:03:02.489> does<00:03:02.790> add<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.329> then<00:03:03.720> other<00:03:03.900> than

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
really does add up and then other than

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
really does add up and then other than
that<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.200> mean<00:03:04.319> they<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.709> drop<00:03:04.889> a<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.220> like

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
that I mean they just drop a lot of like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.940 
that I mean they just drop a lot of like
regular<00:03:05.849> items<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.840> pretty<00:03:07.170> standard<00:03:07.530> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
regular items that are pretty standard I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.890 
regular items that are pretty standard I
mean<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.549> could<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:08.849> spring<00:03:09.150> cleaner<00:03:09.389> these

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
mean I could have spring cleaner these

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.619 
mean I could have spring cleaner these
ruin<00:03:10.739> play<00:03:10.920> bodies<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.430> two<00:03:11.939> h's<00:03:12.269> but<00:03:12.480> back

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
ruin play bodies and two h's but back

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.030 
ruin play bodies and two h's but back
then<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.349> didn't<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.829> spring

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
then I really didn't use the spring

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.220 
then I really didn't use the spring
cleaner<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.540> get<00:03:15.840> about<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
cleaner but you know you get about the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.900 
cleaner but you know you get about the
same<00:03:16.260> amount<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.680> profit<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.549> easier

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
same amount of profit just to be easier

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.569 
same amount of profit just to be easier
and<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.690> they<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.049> noted<00:03:19.739> herbs<00:03:19.949> noted

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and then they do have noted herbs noted

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.360 
and then they do have noted herbs noted
mithril<00:03:20.940> or<00:03:21.120> limp<00:03:21.720> roots<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.919> white

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
mithril or limp roots and the white

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.650 
mithril or limp roots and the white
berries<00:03:23.699> so<00:03:23.910> that's<00:03:24.269> pretty<00:03:24.480> much<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
berries so that's pretty much it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.689 
berries so that's pretty much it
everything<00:03:25.530> else<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.829> basically<00:03:26.040> rare<00:03:26.489> drop

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
everything else is basically rare drop

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.699 
everything else is basically rare drop
table<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.269> then<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.840> did<00:03:28.019> get<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:28.440> risk

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
table and then I did get at risk

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.589 
table and then I did get at risk
fragment<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.430> early<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.090> don't<00:03:30.449> really

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
fragment pretty early on I don't really

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.089 
fragment pretty early on I don't really
remember<00:03:30.690> when<00:03:31.139> but<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.650> kind<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:31.889> cool

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
remember when but that is kind of cool

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.740 
remember when but that is kind of cool
so<00:03:32.519> yeah<00:03:32.639> let's<00:03:32.849> just<00:03:32.879> price<00:03:33.150> check<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:33.510> much<00:03:33.659> I

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so yeah let's just price check so much I

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:50.629 
so yeah let's just price check so much I
made<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:48.199> 1908<00:03:49.199> to<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:49.979> it's<00:03:50.459> kind<00:03:50.609> of

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
made in the 1908 to be and it's kind of

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.309 
made in the 1908 to be and it's kind of
surprising<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.090> they<00:03:51.299> stuck<00:03:51.659> to<00:03:51.870> be<00:03:51.989> around

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
surprising that they stuck to be around

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.080 
surprising that they stuck to be around
three<00:03:52.530> million<00:03:52.709> our<00:03:52.919> even<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.790> know<00:03:53.879> right

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
three million our even to you know right

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.390 
three million our even to you know right
now<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.540> guess<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.590> mean<00:03:55.709> some<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.040> items<00:03:56.159> are

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
now I guess I mean some of the items are

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.219 
now I guess I mean some of the items are
kind<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.699> like<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.389> can't<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.810> change<00:03:58.049> in

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
kind of like they can't really change in

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.110 
kind of like they can't really change in
price<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.739> because<00:03:58.979> they're<00:03:59.159> you<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.549> high

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
price just because they're you know high

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
price just because they're you know high
demand<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.690> everything<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.409> like

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
demand and everything like that and like

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.809 
demand and everything like that and like
most<00:04:01.889> of<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.069> items<00:04:02.280> are<00:04:02.400> actually<00:04:02.669> like

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
most of the items are actually like

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.159 
most of the items are actually like
items<00:04:03.090> that'll<00:04:03.269> never<00:04:03.419> change<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
items that'll never change like the

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.629 
items that'll never change like the
route<00:04:04.319> items<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.799> then<00:04:04.979> obviously<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.489> coin

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
route items and then obviously the coin

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.879 
route items and then obviously the coin
drops<00:04:05.909> so<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> guess<00:04:06.449> it<00:04:06.599> could<00:04:06.810> stay<00:04:07.409> 3<00:04:07.620> min<00:04:07.769> an

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
drops so I guess it could stay 3 min an

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.890 
drops so I guess it could stay 3 min an
hour<00:04:07.979> and<00:04:08.250> that's<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.579> crazy<00:04:08.699> that<00:04:09.449> there's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
hour and that's just crazy that there's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.149 
hour and that's just crazy that there's
still<00:04:10.079> creatures<00:04:10.409> out<00:04:10.560> there<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.859> are<00:04:10.979> very

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
still creatures out there that are very

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.369 
still creatures out there that are very
easy<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.519> kill<00:04:11.790> such<00:04:12.569> as<00:04:12.720> these<00:04:12.870> guys<00:04:13.049> that

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
easy to kill such as these guys that

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.080 
easy to kill such as these guys that
have<00:04:13.530> relatively<00:04:14.159> low<00:04:14.430> requirements<00:04:15.000> other

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
have relatively low requirements other

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.909 
have relatively low requirements other
than<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.659> know<00:04:15.750> actually<00:04:15.930> being<00:04:16.289> in<00:04:16.590> elf<00:04:16.709> city

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
than you know actually being in elf city

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.979 
than you know actually being in elf city
that<00:04:17.609> are<00:04:17.729> 3<00:04:17.909> mil<00:04:18.060> an<00:04:18.180> hour<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.690> not<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
that are 3 mil an hour and not to

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.050 
that are 3 mil an hour and not to
mention<00:04:19.139> they're<00:04:19.349> very<00:04:19.650> good<00:04:19.979> experience<00:04:20.909> per

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
mention they're very good experience per

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.909 
mention they're very good experience per
hour<00:04:21.180> as<00:04:21.479> for<00:04:22.019> combat<00:04:22.409> I<00:04:22.560> mean<00:04:22.680> they're<00:04:22.800> not

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
hour as for combat I mean they're not

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.440 
hour as for combat I mean they're not
that

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
that
