probably<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.230> good<00:03:36.349> stopping<00:03:36.680> but<00:03:37.069> maybe<00:03:37.280> just

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
probably a good stopping but maybe just

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.650 
probably a good stopping but maybe just
a<00:03:37.580> little<00:03:37.819> bit<00:03:37.910> too<00:03:38.000> early<00:03:38.030> for<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.420> crowds

a little bit too early for the crowds

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.160 
a little bit too early for the crowds
likely<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.829> Bernard<00:03:43.400> Hopkins<00:03:43.700> captures<00:03:44.480> his

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
likely so Bernard Hopkins captures his

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.319 
likely so Bernard Hopkins captures his
first<00:03:45.620> world<00:03:45.920> title<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.519> his<00:03:46.579> third<00:03:46.910> tries
