00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
broccoli what we will do is we're going

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.719 
broccoli what we will do is we're going
to<00:01:28.540> use<00:01:28.810> these<00:01:29.050> stalks<00:01:29.470> will<00:01:29.740> peel<00:01:30.040> off<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> few

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
to use these stalks will peel off a few

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.200

of<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.940> stemi<00:01:31.930> pieces<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:37.030> we'll

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
of the stemi pieces and then we'll

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.400
