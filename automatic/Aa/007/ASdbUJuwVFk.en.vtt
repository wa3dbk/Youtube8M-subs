00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
mean how far can it go especially for a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
mean how far can it go especially for a
company<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.570> hasn't<00:00:34.110> produced<00:00:34.800> any

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
getting a time premium I think that's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060

have a $200 price target on Tesla and if

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.319 
have a $200 price target on Tesla and if
Tesla<00:00:47.219> does<00:00:47.399> everything<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.149> they're

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
gonna do over the next few years then

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
gonna do over the next few years then
the<00:00:50.010> stocks<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.489> overvalued<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.449> it's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the stocks not overvalued and it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
the stocks not overvalued and it's
getting<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> premium<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> time

make<00:01:09.510> sense<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.990> depending<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.860> which

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
make sense see depending on which

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
because look at the right one in order

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370

to see a profit there I think the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
to see a profit there I think the
interesting<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

billion<00:01:42.360> dollars<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.220> amazing

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
billion dollars this is to me amazing

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.450 
billion dollars this is to me amazing
and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.899> thinking<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I was thinking about the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.440 
and I was thinking about the
supply-demand

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
supply-demand

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
supply-demand
is<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> case<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.140> they're<00:01:49.799> only<00:01:50.759> making

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
is it the case that they're only making

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
is it the case that they're only making
or<00:01:51.630> only<00:01:51.869> selling<00:01:52.350> five<00:01:52.560> thousand<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> month

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
or only selling five thousand a month

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
or only selling five thousand a month
because<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.030> many<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.479> they

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because that's just as many as they

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
because that's just as many as they
could<00:01:54.659> make<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.350> double<00:01:55.710> production

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
could make if they double production

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.109 
could make if they double production
would<00:01:56.399> they<00:01:56.549> sell<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.000> too<00:01:58.130> yeah<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.579> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
would they sell that too yeah so it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.950 
would they sell that too yeah so it's
five<00:02:00.299> thousand<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> quarter<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.399> they<00:02:02.399> are

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
five thousand a quarter and they are

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
five thousand a quarter and they are
production<00:02:03.960> constrained<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
production constrained a lot of it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.740 
production constrained a lot of it
actually<00:02:05.700> has<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> supplier

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
actually has to do with the supplier

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.529 
actually has to do with the supplier
Network<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.829> suppliers<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.879> ramp<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Network the suppliers have to ramp to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.119 
Network the suppliers have to ramp to
supply<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> Tesla<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.830> way<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.099> can

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
supply to Tesla so that way they can

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.770 
supply to Tesla so that way they can
ramp<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
ramp the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.620 
ramp the
factory<00:02:12.080> Kendu<00:02:12.640> probably<00:02:13.640> about<00:02:13.760> 40,000

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
factory Kendu probably about 40,000

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.970 
factory Kendu probably about 40,000
vehicles<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.410> where<00:02:15.560> they<00:02:15.680> want<00:02:15.890> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
vehicles and that's where they want a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.280 
vehicles and that's where they want a
per<00:02:16.670> year<00:02:16.970> without<00:02:17.120> any<00:02:17.270> more<00:02:17.660> investment<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
per year without any more investment and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.630 
per year without any more investment and
that's<00:02:18.350> really<00:02:18.620> want<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.830> get<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> next<00:02:19.400> year

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
that's really want to get to next year

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's really want to get to next year
but<00:02:20.510> our<00:02:20.720> supplier<00:02:21.170> constrained<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:21.920> well

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
but our supplier constrained as well

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100 
but our supplier constrained as well
that's<00:02:22.550> what<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.730> was<00:02:22.850> wondering<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.330> mean<00:02:23.360> where

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
that's what I was wondering I mean where

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.410 
that's what I was wondering I mean where
do<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.319> think<00:02:24.500> demand<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:25.730> they'll

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
do you think demand is because they'll

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.870 
do you think demand is because they'll
basically<00:02:27.110> by<00:02:27.350> as<00:02:27.590> many<00:02:27.770> as<00:02:27.920> Elon<00:02:28.340> Musk<00:02:28.640> can

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
basically by as many as Elon Musk can

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.479 
basically by as many as Elon Musk can
make<00:02:29.120> how<00:02:29.780> far<00:02:30.080> does<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.220> demand

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
make how far does that go is the demand

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.470 
make how far does that go is the demand
at<00:02:31.700> 60,000<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> year<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.989> at<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> hundred<00:02:34.480> so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
at 60,000 a year is it at a hundred so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.510 
at 60,000 a year is it at a hundred so
it's<00:02:35.870> an<00:02:35.989> interesting<00:02:36.230> question<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:36.890> you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
it's an interesting question because you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.309 
it's an interesting question because you
know<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> would<00:02:37.850> have<00:02:37.970> said<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.020> know<00:02:39.140> maybe

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
know I would have said you know maybe

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.070 
know I would have said you know maybe
50,000<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.190> year<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.510> Consumer<00:02:41.930> Reports

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
50,000 a year on the Consumer Reports

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.720 
50,000 a year on the Consumer Reports
report<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.069> best<00:02:43.280> car<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
report that it's the best car on the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.160 
report that it's the best car on the
market<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.540> got<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> report

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
market but now I just got the report

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.259 
market but now I just got the report
that<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.860> safest<00:02:46.370> car<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.910> market

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
that it's the safest car on the market

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.320 
that it's the safest car on the market
and<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:49.220> even<00:02:49.430> changes<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.030> demand

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
and so that even changes the demand

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.540 
and so that even changes the demand
equation<00:02:50.630> even<00:02:51.080> still<00:02:51.320> further<00:02:51.620> because<00:02:51.980> it's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
equation even still further because it's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.210 
equation even still further because it's
the<00:02:53.060> safest<00:02:53.480> car<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:53.959> drive<00:02:54.220> electric

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
the safest car you can drive electric

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.400 
the safest car you can drive electric
vehicle<00:02:55.519> technology<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.750> disruptive

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
vehicle technology is really disruptive

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.360 
vehicle technology is really disruptive
and<00:02:57.650> you're<00:02:58.280> seeing<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.660> means<00:03:00.370> here

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
and you're seeing what that means here

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.550 
and you're seeing what that means here
in<00:03:01.489> Tesla<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.690> talk<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.959> us<00:03:03.110> about<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
in Tesla but talk to us about the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800 
in Tesla but talk to us about the
potential<00:03:04.100> consumers<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.090> mean<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.569> base

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
potential consumers here I mean the base

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.930 
potential consumers here I mean the base
price<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.610> Tesla

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
price I think for that is that the Tesla

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.759 
price I think for that is that the Tesla
s<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.239> about<00:03:08.480> 71<00:03:08.930> thousand<00:03:09.319> dollars<00:03:09.650> but

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
s is about 71 thousand dollars but

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.440 
s is about 71 thousand dollars but
you're<00:03:09.920> talking<00:03:10.430> about<00:03:10.700> really<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.120> hundred

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
you're talking about really a hundred

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.000 
you're talking about really a hundred
thousand<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.319> probably<00:03:12.590> get<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.800> car<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
thousand to probably get the car you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.930 
thousand to probably get the car you
really<00:03:13.459> want

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
really want

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.789 
really want
I<00:03:13.970> mean<00:03:14.269> Andrea<00:03:14.660> how<00:03:15.050> big<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.500> that

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
I mean Andrea how big is that

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.810 
I mean Andrea how big is that
marketplace<00:03:16.549> realistically<00:03:17.860> yes<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.370> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
marketplace realistically yes so on I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.030 
marketplace realistically yes so on I
think<00:03:20.360> 40,000<00:03:20.930> vehicles<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.320> year<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.650> two

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
think 40,000 vehicles a year is two

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.400 
think 40,000 vehicles a year is two
percent<00:03:22.459> market<00:03:22.940> share<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.329> that<00:03:23.720> market<00:03:24.230> so

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
percent market share on that market so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.090 
percent market share on that market so
it's<00:03:24.560> two<00:03:24.860> percent<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.530> if<00:03:27.650> they<00:03:27.769> were<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.980> do

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
it's two percent so if they were to do

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.069 
it's two percent so if they were to do
four<00:03:28.370> percent<00:03:28.760> market<00:03:29.120> share<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:29.840> you're<00:03:29.959> at

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
four percent market share then you're at

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.680 
four percent market share then you're at
eighty<00:03:30.230> thousand<00:03:30.709> vehicles<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:31.190> year<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.820> so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
eighty thousand vehicles a year so so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.970 
eighty thousand vehicles a year so so
there's<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.900> lot<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.079> percents<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.680> market

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
there's a lot of percents of market

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
there's a lot of percents of market
share<00:03:34.010> for<00:03:34.310> them<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.549> capture<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.660> they<00:03:35.750> have

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
share for them to capture and they have

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.270 
share for them to capture and they have
to<00:03:35.959> make<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> vehicles<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.829> meet<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.160> demand

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
to make the vehicles to meet that demand

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.370 
to make the vehicles to meet that demand
so<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.880> they've<00:03:37.970> done<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.360> obviously<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> great

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
so and they've done it obviously a great

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.199 
so and they've done it obviously a great
job<00:03:39.709> designing<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.430> vehicle<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.060> know<00:03:41.120> a

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
job designing this vehicle I know a

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.509 
job designing this vehicle I know a
couple<00:03:41.420> people<00:03:41.540> who<00:03:41.930> bought<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.519> absolutely

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
couple people who bought it absolutely

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.580 
couple people who bought it absolutely
absolutely<00:03:46.060> like<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.180> said<00:03:47.390> it's<00:03:47.630> gotten

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
absolutely like you said it's gotten

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.900 
absolutely like you said it's gotten
incredible<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.250> mean<00:03:49.370> they<00:03:49.489> broke<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
incredible I mean they broke the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.099 
incredible I mean they broke the
equipment<00:03:50.269> when<00:03:50.359> they<00:03:50.390> were<00:03:50.510> testing<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.959> for

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
equipment when they were testing it for

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.319 
equipment when they were testing it for
safety<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.280> no<00:03:52.459> one<00:03:52.579> even<00:03:52.760> knows<00:03:52.880> how<00:03:53.060> safe

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
safety so but no one even knows how safe

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.870 
safety so but no one even knows how safe
it<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.570> but<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.739> wonder<00:03:55.370> what<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.549> think<00:03:55.579> about

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
it is but I wonder what you think about

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.479 
it is but I wonder what you think about
other<00:03:56.750> competitors<00:03:57.560> coming<00:03:57.799> into<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.220> space

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
other competitors coming into the space

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.420 
other competitors coming into the space
because<00:03:58.970> it's<00:03:59.359> not<00:03:59.510> going<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.720> be<00:03:59.810> long<00:04:00.109> before

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
because it's not going to be long before

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.590 
because it's not going to be long before
the<00:04:01.430> likes<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.820> General<00:04:02.180> Motors<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.450> Ford

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
the likes of General Motors and Ford

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.170 
the likes of General Motors and Ford
realized<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.709> there<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.400> money<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:04.940> made

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
realized that there is money to be made

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.840 
realized that there is money to be made
here<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.780> mean<00:04:06.200> every<00:04:06.859> car<00:04:07.100> company<00:04:07.370> could<00:04:07.700> get

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
here I mean every car company could get

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.580 
here I mean every car company could get
into<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.150> space<00:04:08.390> arguably<00:04:08.930> fairly<00:04:09.380> easily

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
into this space arguably fairly easily

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.800 
into this space arguably fairly easily
right<00:04:11.829> no<00:04:12.829> because<00:04:13.130> Tesla<00:04:13.910> has<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> lot<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.540> IP

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
right no because Tesla has a lot of IP

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
right no because Tesla has a lot of IP
and<00:04:15.200> their<00:04:15.350> battery<00:04:15.709> technology<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.700> their

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and their battery technology and their

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.430 
and their battery technology and their
thermo<00:04:17.180> management

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
thermo management

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.520 
thermo management
so<00:04:18.890> a<00:04:19.280> lot<00:04:19.580> of<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.790> has<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.239> with<00:04:20.440> Tesla's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.020 

it's<00:04:24.530> they<00:04:25.130> have<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.310> lot<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.520> IP<00:04:25.730> in<00:04:26.000> the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
it's they have a lot of IP in the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.090 
it's they have a lot of IP in the
battery<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.660> match<00:04:26.930> technology<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.770> five<00:04:27.980> to

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
battery and match technology is five to

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.680 
battery and match technology is five to
ten<00:04:28.280> years<00:04:28.490> ahead<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.880> competition<00:04:29.030> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
ten years ahead of the competition and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.810 
ten years ahead of the competition and
they<00:04:30.320> get<00:04:30.470> an<00:04:30.560> amazing<00:04:31.010> range<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.640> they're

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
they get an amazing range and they're

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.550 
they get an amazing range and they're
using<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.420> time<00:04:32.780> they've<00:04:33.110> got<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.290> time

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
using this time they've got a time

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.560 
using this time they've got a time
advantage<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.280> first<00:04:34.820> mover<00:04:35.180> advantage

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
advantage a first mover advantage

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.970 
advantage a first mover advantage
they're<00:04:35.750> using<00:04:36.080> this<00:04:36.170> time<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.440> build<00:04:36.770> out<00:04:36.950> a

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
they're using this time to build out a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.300 
they're using this time to build out a
charging<00:04:37.550> network<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:38.920> so<00:04:39.920> even<00:04:40.100> if

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
charging network that so even if

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.230 
charging network that so even if
somebody<00:04:40.460> were<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.730> come<00:04:40.940> into<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> market

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
somebody were to come into the market

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.060 
somebody were to come into the market
maybe<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.810> couple<00:04:42.140> years<00:04:42.320> from<00:04:42.410> now<00:04:42.590> Tesla<00:04:43.010> is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
maybe a couple years from now Tesla is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.440 
maybe a couple years from now Tesla is
already<00:04:43.340> gonna<00:04:43.460> have<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.700> charging<00:04:44.060> network

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
already gonna have a charging network

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.990 
already gonna have a charging network
built<00:04:44.690> out<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.860> still<00:04:46.280> gives<00:04:46.520> them<00:04:46.730> further

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
built out that still gives them further

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.060 
built out that still gives them further
advantage<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.720> will<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.080> only<00:04:48.350> work<00:04:48.530> with<00:04:48.770> will

advantage I will it only work with will
only<00:04:49.310> work<00:04:49.520> with<00:04:49.700> Tesla's<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.390> they're

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
only work with Tesla's that they're

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.470 
only work with Tesla's that they're

supercharger network their proprietary
to<00:04:54.020> Tesla<00:04:54.440> right<00:04:54.650> now<00:04:54.830> yeah<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.520> because<00:04:55.940> they

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
to Tesla right now yeah and because they

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.760 
to Tesla right now yeah and because they
have<00:04:56.210> such<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.420> long<00:04:56.720> range<00:04:57.020> on<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.350> car<00:04:57.530> the

have such a long range on the car the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.010 
have such a long range on the car the
car<00:04:57.920> can<00:04:58.040> go<00:04:58.160> 300<00:04:58.670> miles<00:04:58.820> they<00:04:59.480> don't<00:04:59.660> need<00:04:59.810> as

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
car can go 300 miles they don't need as

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.680 
car can go 300 miles they don't need as
many<00:05:00.400> superchargers<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.640> station<00:05:02.360> around<00:05:02.600> the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
many superchargers a station around the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.660 
many superchargers a station around the
country<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.620> get<00:05:03.740> from<00:05:03.950> point<00:05:04.160> A<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.280> point<00:05:04.400> B

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
country to get from point A to point B

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.760 
country to get from point A to point B
whereas<00:05:05.540> if<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.720> have<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.840> shorter<00:05:06.230> range<00:05:06.440> such

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
whereas if you have a shorter range such

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.500 
whereas if you have a shorter range such
as<00:05:06.890> like<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.130> BMW<00:05:07.580> i3<00:05:07.700> for<00:05:08.090> example<00:05:08.420> the

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
as like the BMW i3 for example the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.420 
as like the BMW i3 for example the
electric<00:05:08.840> range<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.140> think<00:05:09.170> is<00:05:09.440> under<00:05:10.100> 100

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
electric range I think is under 100
