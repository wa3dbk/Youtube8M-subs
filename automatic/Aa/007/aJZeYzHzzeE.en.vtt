00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.140
 Here I am I Zach cover is it is in Aichi 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.070
 I would like to talk about the waterproof cover 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.830
 8 I say I Zack for climbing 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.369
 How is it done 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.369
 It has well be in that this kind of nylon and Kano steel pipe made of fabric 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.780
 It seems that it is difficult to get water into it, but I did coating or 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.510
 And during the rain as it was not completely waterproof 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.350
 I 'm walking all the way in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 Naturally we will see while the article gets wet 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.210
 You will end up with all the stuff in the package 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.900
 So it is rain cover to use at that time 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.000
 This is by the way with regard to this backpack 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.960
 Based on this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 In this part 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.870
 Or burger 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.379
 Belongs to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.379
 Leaving 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.340
 In the form of 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.650
 Two covers will be available 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.220
 It is the most likely of Zach say that this kind of rain person 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:29.160
 So Well that has become sold separately 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.160
 The cover that the maker of Zac has put out 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.010
 You may buy some items and prepare them 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.730
 Well I think that originally called either any possible things that come with doing this 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:45.050
 The important thing is the rain cover that fits the size of the go 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.870
 But also or have became so can do is it that some size regulation say buy 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.480
 If too much size 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.520
 Wind comes in from such a place 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.039
 I'm sorry 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.039
 Very difficult to use on the mountain 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.950
 Another important thing is the small size even with the main cover
