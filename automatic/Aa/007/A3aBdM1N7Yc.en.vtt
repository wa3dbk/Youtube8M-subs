00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.559 

so<00:00:05.400> now<00:00:05.520> I'm<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.759> show<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.270> make

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
so now I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.620 
so now I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:06.779> hammer<00:00:07.410> dango<00:00:08.010> component<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:09.150> hang<00:00:09.360> off<00:00:09.599> of

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
a hammer dango component to hang off of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.910 
a hammer dango component to hang off of
your<00:00:10.230> chain<00:00:10.730> so<00:00:11.730> basically<00:00:12.090> we've<00:00:12.330> made<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
your chain so basically we've made the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.519 
your chain so basically we've made the
basic<00:00:13.920> unit<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> loop<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.500> I'm<00:00:16.500> going

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
basic unit with the loop and I'm going

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859 
basic unit with the loop and I'm going
to<00:00:16.830> pick<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> place<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.820> put<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to pick a place to put it on to the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.580 
to pick a place to put it on to the
chain<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.340> gonna<00:00:23.460> look<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.699> this

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
chain and so it's gonna look like this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.709 
chain and so it's gonna look like this
and<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.890> gonna<00:00:26.130> start<00:00:28.340> wrapping<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> with

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and I'm gonna start wrapping so with

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860 
and I'm gonna start wrapping so with
this<00:00:33.840> technique<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:36.329> heavier

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this technique you can use a heavier

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.490 
this technique you can use a heavier
wire<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.160> were<00:00:38.280> using<00:00:38.520> before<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
wire then you were using before or a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
wire then you were using before or a
thinner<00:00:40.500> wire<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> little

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
thinner wire you want something a little

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
thinner wire you want something a little
bit<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.480> dainty<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.670> finer

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
bit more dainty and be like finer

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
bit more dainty and be like finer
looking<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> basically<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> have

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
looking so basically that's what I have

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
looking so basically that's what I have
and<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:53.629> lay<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> metal<00:00:55.230> block

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and I'm going to lay it on a metal block

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.900 
and I'm going to lay it on a metal block
and<00:00:56.840> basically<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.140> hammer<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:59.609> metal

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and basically when you hammer the metal

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
and basically when you hammer the metal
you're<00:01:00.420> flattening<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.170> metal<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> also<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you're flattening the metal and also you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
you're flattening the metal and also you
are<00:01:02.879> able<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.329> stretch<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> direction

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
are able to stretch it in the direction

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.359 
are able to stretch it in the direction
that<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> go<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.860> I'm<00:01:07.860> gonna<00:01:08.100> look

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that you want it to go so I'm gonna look

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
that you want it to go so I'm gonna look
and<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:11.630> want<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and see if I want this to be I want it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.370 
and see if I want this to be I want it
to<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.900> shorter<00:01:14.509> okay<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to be shorter okay so I think that's a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
to be shorter okay so I think that's a
good<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.490> been<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> minute<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.759> I'm

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
good it's been a minute and so now I'm

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.210 
good it's been a minute and so now I'm
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.500> hammer<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> flatten

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
going to hammer it and when you flatten

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.140 
going to hammer it and when you flatten
the<00:01:23.400> metal<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> reflect<00:01:25.110> light

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.540 

differently<00:01:30.150> than<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:31.230> it<00:01:31.350> was<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> round<00:01:31.890> piece

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
differently than if it was a round piece

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.370 
differently than if it was a round piece
of<00:01:32.730> wire<00:01:32.910> so<00:01:33.330> I'm<00:01:33.390> flattening<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:33.990> metal<00:01:34.230> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of wire so I'm flattening the metal and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
of wire so I'm flattening the metal and
I'm<00:01:34.470> also<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.160> of<00:01:35.250> stretching<00:01:35.760> it<00:01:35.990> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I'm also kind of stretching it in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.410 
I'm also kind of stretching it in
different<00:01:37.560> directions<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> way

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
different directions so if I go this way

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.950 
different directions so if I go this way
it's<00:01:40.100> touches<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> horizontally<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.330> kind<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's touches it horizontally I'm kind of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's touches it horizontally I'm kind of
dragging<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.590> hammer<00:01:43.950> across<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.000> metal<00:01:47.450> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
dragging my hammer across the metal so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.820 
dragging my hammer across the metal so
you<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.960> something<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.500> looks<00:01:49.710> like

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
you would get something that looks like

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.760 
you would get something that looks like
this<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.050> kind<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.410> reflects

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this and you see how it kind of reflects

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.640 
this and you see how it kind of reflects
like<00:01:56.010> completely<00:01:56.729> differently<00:01:57.119> than<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.720> round

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
like completely differently than a round

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.600 
like completely differently than a round
piece<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.010> Wagner<00:02:01.040> okay<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> can

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
piece of Wagner okay so then you can

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.719 
piece of Wagner okay so then you can
look<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.890> decide<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.550> length

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
look and decide if you like the length

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
look and decide if you like the length
of<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.240> dangle

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of this dangle

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
of this dangle
I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:07.830> gonna<00:02:07.950> make<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.820> bit

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I think I'm gonna make it a little bit

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.610 
I think I'm gonna make it a little bit
shorter<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.320> gonna<00:02:10.440> snip<00:02:11.070> off<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
shorter so I'm just gonna snip off the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
shorter so I'm just gonna snip off the
edge<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.070> gonna<00:02:14.160> hold<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.760> I'm<00:02:15.330> just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
edge and I'm gonna hold it I'm just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080 
edge and I'm gonna hold it I'm just
gonna<00:02:15.660> snip<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> off<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.880> snip

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
gonna snip it off and then when you snip

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
gonna snip it off and then when you snip
it<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.420> lose<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.840> sort<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.080> organic

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it off you lose that sort of organic

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.170 
it off you lose that sort of organic
hammered<00:02:20.550> edge<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.420> gonna<00:02:21.540> lightly

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
hammered edge so I'm just gonna lightly

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.690 
hammered edge so I'm just gonna lightly
hammer<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.989> get<00:02:25.140> sort<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.470> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
hammer it so then you get sort of that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.699 
hammer it so then you get sort of that
organic<00:02:26.780> finish<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:30.390> how<00:02:30.720> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
organic finish on it and that's how you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.940 
organic finish on it and that's how you
make<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.280> dangle
