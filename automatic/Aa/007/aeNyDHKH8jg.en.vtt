the<00:05:05.410> fight<00:05:05.620> up<00:05:05.890> front<00:05:06.220> here<00:05:06.729> comes<00:05:06.910> synthesis

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
the fight up front here comes synthesis

Ollie<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.960> CAV<00:05:08.110> getting<00:05:08.380> rear<00:05:08.560> charges<00:05:09.039> they

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
Ollie and CAV getting rear charges they

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.460 
Ollie and CAV getting rear charges they
have<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.700> go<00:05:09.820> through<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.330> onager<00:05:10.720> pieces<00:05:11.289> so

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
have to go through the onager pieces so

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.340 
have to go through the onager pieces so
it<00:05:11.560> slows<00:05:11.770> their<00:05:12.010> charge<00:05:12.250> down<00:05:12.460> considerably

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
it slows their charge down considerably

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.840 
it slows their charge down considerably
I've<00:05:14.350> noticed<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.039> sawing<00:05:15.250> cab<00:05:15.580> pulls

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
I've noticed that the sawing cab pulls

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.490 
I've noticed that the sawing cab pulls
out<00:05:16.000> swords<00:05:16.510> whenever<00:05:16.870> they<00:05:17.020> go<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.260> melee

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
coma which is kind of cool the Spartan

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.150 
coma which is kind of cool the Spartan
pikemen<00:05:20.169> broke<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.830> I'm<00:05:20.890> gonna<00:05:20.979> go<00:05:21.130> ahead

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
also going to route so that's pretty

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.490 
also going to route so that's pretty
much<00:05:36.490> it<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:37.030> this<00:05:37.300> fight<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:38.050> was<00:05:38.140> kind<00:05:38.320> of<00:05:38.350> an

interesting<00:05:39.010> one<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:39.190> was<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.640> large<00:05:40.479> or

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
interesting one this was a large or

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.159 
interesting one this was a large or
ultra<00:05:41.410> funds<00:05:41.620> battle<00:05:42.450> that's<00:05:43.450> why<00:05:43.630> you<00:05:43.690> saw<00:05:43.930> so

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
ultra funds battle that's why you saw so

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.480 
ultra funds battle that's why you saw so
many<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.410> these<00:05:44.470> elite<00:05:44.740> units<00:05:45.100> and<00:05:45.280> then<00:05:45.370> the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
many of these elite units and then the

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.830 
many of these elite units and then the
the<00:05:45.729> units<00:05:46.030> that<00:05:46.150> my<00:05:46.240> opponent<00:05:46.570> brought<00:05:46.690> there

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
the units that my opponent brought there

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.000 
the units that my opponent brought there
but<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:46.990> thought<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:47.200> liked<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.620> just<00:05:47.800> cuz<00:05:47.919> it

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
but I thought you liked this just cuz it

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.830 
but I thought you liked this just cuz it
was<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.160> little<00:05:48.340> different<00:05:48.760> than<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.630> typical

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
was a little different than a typical

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840 
was a little different than a typical
battle<00:05:50.320> none<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.070> my<00:05:51.160> pikemen<00:05:51.490> actually<00:05:51.700> got<00:05:51.820> a

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
battle none of my pikemen actually got a

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.010 
battle none of my pikemen actually got a
whole<00:05:51.970> lot<00:05:52.090> of<00:05:52.180> kills<00:05:52.360> it's<00:05:52.510> because<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.840> takes

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
whole lot of kills it's because it takes

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.930 
whole lot of kills it's because it takes
a<00:05:53.140> long<00:05:53.350> time<00:05:53.380> for<00:05:53.680> pikemen<00:05:54.190> to<00:05:54.310> get<00:05:54.460> kills<00:05:54.729> or

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
a long time for pikemen to get kills or

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.580 
a long time for pikemen to get kills or
they<00:05:55.090> have<00:05:55.240> to<00:05:55.390> be<00:05:55.510> in<00:05:55.660> a<00:05:55.720> choke<00:05:55.930> point<00:05:55.960> royal

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
they have to be in a choke point royal

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
how I got this many kills I guess it

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.129 
how I got this many kills I guess it
just<00:06:12.849> adds<00:06:13.000> up<00:06:13.240> across<00:06:13.419> all<00:06:13.629> my<00:06:13.750> units<00:06:13.990> not

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
just adds up across all my units not

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.510 
just adds up across all my units not
none<00:06:14.349> of<00:06:14.379> my<00:06:14.500> units<00:06:14.800> in<00:06:14.889> particular<00:06:15.340> really

none of my units in particular really
did<00:06:15.699> all<00:06:15.759> that<00:06:15.940> well<00:06:16.120> but<00:06:16.960> my<00:06:17.080> opponents<00:06:17.500> units

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
did all that well but my opponents units

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.710
