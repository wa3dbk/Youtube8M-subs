00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.699 
like 50 TV shows that I have not watched
so<00:02:19.400> basically<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.030> semester<00:02:20.569> was<00:02:20.810> super

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
so basically this semester was super

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.879 
so basically this semester was super
hectic<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.999> was<00:02:23.359> just<00:02:23.689> filled<00:02:23.930> with<00:02:24.109> so<00:02:24.680> many

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:24.889 
hectic it was just filled with so many

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.819 
hectic it was just filled with so many
different<00:02:25.129> things<00:02:25.400> um<00:02:26.109> classes<00:02:27.109> for<00:02:27.379> starters

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
different things um classes for starters

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.640 
different things um classes for starters
I<00:02:28.099> thought<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.000> was<00:02:29.150> taking<00:02:29.299> like<00:02:29.659> less<00:02:30.019> credits

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
I thought I was taking like less credits

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.920 
I thought I was taking like less credits
um<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.519> apparently<00:02:31.909> because<00:02:32.359> classes<00:02:32.810> were

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
um but apparently because classes were

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.720 
um but apparently because classes were
harder<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.799> didn't<00:02:34.099> matter<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.579> was

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
harder it didn't matter that I was

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.819 
harder it didn't matter that I was
taking<00:02:35.030> less<00:02:35.209> credits<00:02:35.689> because<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:36.379> still<00:02:36.650> had

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
taking less credits because I still had

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.740 
taking less credits because I still had
to<00:02:36.920> study<00:02:37.159> just<00:02:37.459> as<00:02:37.609> much<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:37.969> my<00:02:38.120> 20<00:02:38.419> credits

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
to study just as much as my 20 credits

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.199
