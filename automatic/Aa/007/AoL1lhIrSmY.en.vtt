00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
it'll be interesting to see how that is

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.640 
it'll be interesting to see how that is
also<00:00:07.940> the<00:00:08.940> sport<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.080> white<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.559> know

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650

also the sport and it's in white I know
there's<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.040> lot<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.309> competition<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
there's a lot of competition on the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
there's a lot of competition on the
black<00:00:13.049> version<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.790> chose<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> white

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
black version I just chose a white

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
black version I just chose a white
because<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.690> chip<00:00:15.929> faster<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.039> I'm

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
because your chip faster and because I'm

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
because your chip faster and because I'm
sort<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.550> white<00:00:17.760> better<00:00:18.029> even<00:00:18.779> though<00:00:18.900> I

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
sort of like white better even though I

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.099 
sort of like white better even though I
think<00:00:19.740> combination<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.420> black<00:00:21.779> casing

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
think combination of the black casing

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.070 
think combination of the black casing
and<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> white<00:00:23.090> very<00:00:24.090> cool<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.930> an

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and the white very cool now this is an

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.130 
and the white very cool now this is an
interesting<00:00:25.320> box<00:00:25.849> I<00:00:26.849> didn't<00:00:27.480> expect<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
interesting box I didn't expect it to be

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
interesting box I didn't expect it to be
like<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.650> long<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:30.289> oddly<00:00:31.289> shaped<00:00:32.030> but

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
like this long and this oddly shaped but

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.030 
like this long and this oddly shaped but
I<00:00:33.480> guess<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.850> cut<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> open<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> plastic

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.010 

and<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> look<00:00:45.090> inside<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
charger looks a little bit funny because

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.750

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
elongated so this could just tear this

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.310 
elongated so this could just tear this
all<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.880> Apple<00:01:18.060> watch<00:01:18.270> could<00:01:19.140> be

traditional<00:02:18.410> wall<00:02:19.410> charger<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> way<00:02:21.960> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
traditional wall charger like the way to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.540 
traditional wall charger like the way to
get<00:02:22.200> an<00:02:22.260> iPhone<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.190> get<00:02:23.340> your

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
get an iPhone and then you get your

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.470 
get an iPhone and then you get your
Apple<00:02:24.240> watch<00:02:24.270> charger<00:02:25.100> which<00:02:29.090> looks<00:02:30.090> super

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
Apple watch charger which looks super

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.580 
Apple watch charger which looks super
funky<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.110> looks<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:32.690> normal<00:02:33.690> cable<00:02:34.290> but

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
funky it looks like a normal cable but

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.550 
funky it looks like a normal cable but
then<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.860> comes<00:02:35.280> out<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:37.260> bumpy

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
then it comes out with this little bumpy

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.220 
then it comes out with this little bumpy
thing<00:02:37.770> at<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> end<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:39.230> interesting

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
thing at the end which is interesting

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.070 
thing at the end which is interesting
but<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.500> pushed<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.190> put<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.700> think

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
but you pushed it you put this I think

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.590 
but you pushed it you put this I think
some<00:02:43.080> order<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.970> Apple<00:02:45.209> watch<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
some order like that the Apple watch and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.300 
some order like that the Apple watch and
they<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:46.020> connect<00:02:46.290> magnetically<00:02:46.980> if<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.130> take

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
they will connect magnetically if I take

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
they will connect magnetically if I take
off<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.580> plastic<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.750> that's<00:02:49.200> how<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
off this plastic and that's how it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.650 
off this plastic and that's how it
charges<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.250> what<00:02:53.540> they<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.630> a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
charges so this is what they have a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.930 
charges so this is what they have a
watch<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> plastic<00:02:55.680> off<00:02:55.830> looks<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.490> up

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
watch with the plastic off looks like up

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 
watch with the plastic off looks like up
close<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.660> I'll<00:02:58.350> put<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:58.740> wrist<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
close now I'll put on my wrist but it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.210 
close now I'll put on my wrist but it
looks<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.880> lot<00:03:00.030> smaller<00:03:00.420> than<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> lot<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
looks a lot smaller than a lot of the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.400 
looks a lot smaller than a lot of the
ones<00:03:02.430> shown<00:03:02.760> off<00:03:03.000> by<00:03:03.390> Apple<00:03:03.840> previously<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.380> I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
ones shown off by Apple previously and I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.710 
ones shown off by Apple previously and I
think<00:03:04.620> that's<00:03:04.770> because<00:03:04.920> they've<00:03:05.160> been<00:03:05.250> mainly

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
think that's because they've been mainly

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.740 
think that's because they've been mainly
showing<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> large<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
showing the large one and this is the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
showing the large one and this is the
smaller<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.080> here<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:11.040> selection

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
smaller one so here we have a selection

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.600 
smaller one so here we have a selection
for<00:03:11.760> language<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.800> now<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.040> need<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> pair<00:03:14.580> it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
for language and now we need to pair it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.720 
for language and now we need to pair it
with<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:15.030> phone<00:03:15.300> which<00:03:15.920> I'll<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.459> here<00:03:20.700> I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
with my phone which I'll do so here I

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.040 
with my phone which I'll do so here I
have<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.269> wrist<00:03:21.480> they<00:03:21.780> clicked

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
have it on the wrist they clicked

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.660 
have it on the wrist they clicked
appearing<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.739> think<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.010> doing<00:03:23.400> some

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
appearing and I think it's doing some

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.420 
appearing and I think it's doing some
interesting<00:03:24.030> QR<00:03:24.570> code<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.200> connection<00:03:26.130> but

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
interesting QR code like connection but

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.800 
interesting QR code like connection but
they<00:03:26.519> don't<00:03:26.730> have<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.060> app<00:03:27.209> running<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.690> my

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
they don't have the app running on my

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.320 
they don't have the app running on my
phone<00:03:28.019> yet<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.459> gonna<00:03:29.700> recognize<00:03:29.880> I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
phone yet so it's not gonna recognize I

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.509 
phone yet so it's not gonna recognize I
just<00:03:30.510> wanted<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.840> give<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.350> quick<00:03:31.920> look<00:03:32.130> at

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
just wanted to give you a quick look at

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.630 
just wanted to give you a quick look at
what<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.540> looks<00:03:33.600> like<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.680> wrist<00:03:34.890> now<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
what it looks like on the wrist now I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.330 
what it looks like on the wrist now I
guess<00:03:36.600> my<00:03:36.630> wrist<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.140> around<00:03:37.320> normal<00:03:38.130> size

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
guess my wrist is around normal size

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.300 
guess my wrist is around normal size
this<00:03:38.940> one<00:03:39.120> barely<00:03:39.450> fits<00:03:39.780> me<00:03:39.959> at<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.920> biggest

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
this one barely fits me at the biggest

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.490 
this one barely fits me at the biggest
setting<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.269> think<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.750> did<00:03:42.930> whatever

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
setting and I think I just did whatever

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.350 
setting and I think I just did whatever
the<00:03:43.709> default<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.400> when<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> ordered<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.299> I

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
the default was when I ordered it but I

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.030 
the default was when I ordered it but I
believe<00:03:45.570> there<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.380> other<00:03:46.530> strapping

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
believe there is that other strapping

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.830 
believe there is that other strapping
might<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.370> might<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.700> one<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.480> makes<00:03:48.660> it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
might be it might be one that makes it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.300 
might be it might be one that makes it
longer<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.440> could<00:03:49.590> pop<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.070> straps

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
longer and you could pop up the straps

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.940 
longer and you could pop up the straps
pretty<00:03:50.610> easily<00:03:51.320> as<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.739> they're

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
pretty easily as you can see they're

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.470 
pretty easily as you can see they're
just<00:03:52.980> connected<00:03:53.580> right<00:03:53.730> there<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.299> push

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
just connected right there and then push

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.390 
just connected right there and then push
a<00:03:54.510> button<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> bottom<00:03:55.320> when<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.160> off

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
a button on the bottom when it's off

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
a button on the bottom when it's off
your<00:03:56.670> wrist<00:03:56.940> it'll<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.420> pop<00:03:57.600> up<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> just

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
