what a tandem to come in as rookies I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.110 
what a tandem to come in as rookies I
can't<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.950> another<00:02:37.160> tandem<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.970> came

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.339 
team
Washington<00:06:42.330> has<00:06:42.419> problems<00:06:42.839> on<00:06:42.959> defense

the<00:07:03.479> fact<00:07:03.719> put<00:07:03.929> a<00:07:03.959> little<00:07:04.110> asterisk<00:07:04.349> nice<00:07:04.919> -

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
the fact put a little asterisk nice -

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.449 
the fact put a little asterisk nice -
that<00:07:05.249> ain't<00:07:05.520> no<00:07:05.580> record<00:07:06.479> at<00:07:06.599> home<00:07:06.629> I<00:07:07.459> thought

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:08.459 
that ain't no record at home I thought

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.230 
that ain't no record at home I thought
it<00:07:08.520> would've<00:07:08.669> been<00:07:08.789> great<00:07:08.909> if<00:07:09.089> the<00:07:09.479> 49ers<00:07:10.080> lost

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
it would've been great if the 49ers lost

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.489 
it would've been great if the 49ers lost
which<00:07:12.240> they<00:07:12.389> didn't<00:07:12.689> if<00:07:12.749> the<00:07:12.809> 49ers<00:07:13.169> lost<00:07:13.409> on

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:13.499 
which they didn't if the 49ers lost on

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.929 
which they didn't if the 49ers lost on
the<00:07:13.559> Seahawks<00:07:13.709> in<00:07:14.159> the<00:07:14.369> Packers<00:07:14.729> would<00:07:14.819> have

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
the Seahawks in the Packers would have

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.089 
the Seahawks in the Packers would have

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
tied for the number two seed and the pin

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.350 
tied for the number two seed and the pin
the<00:07:17.189> Seahawks<00:07:17.519> would<00:07:17.669> have<00:07:17.789> got<00:07:18.029> the<00:07:18.119> number

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
the Seahawks would have got the number

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
two seed in the bye by virtue of the

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.619 
two seed in the bye by virtue of the
Golden<00:07:20.339> Tate<00:07:20.490> touchdown<00:07:20.939> I<00:07:20.969> was<00:07:21.179> so<00:07:21.330> rooting

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:21.629 
Golden Tate touchdown I was so rooting

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:22.879

for<00:07:21.749> that<00:07:21.809> it<00:07:22.019> would<00:07:22.080> have<00:07:22.199> been<00:07:22.229> got<00:07:22.769> the

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
for that it would have been got the

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.159 
for that it would have been got the
number<00:07:23.129> two<00:07:23.279> seed<00:07:23.490> because<00:07:23.789> of<00:07:23.939> that<00:07:24.029> any<00:07:24.300> well

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
number two seed because of that any well

number two seed because of that any well
you<00:07:25.529> could<00:07:25.709> argue<00:07:25.889> had<00:07:26.459> they<00:07:26.610> lost<00:07:26.849> then<00:07:27.089> the

00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:27.119 
you could argue had they lost then the

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:28.279 
you could argue had they lost then the
Packers<00:07:27.479> would<00:07:27.599> have<00:07:27.689> had<00:07:27.779> the<00:07:27.869> number<00:07:28.139> two

Packers would have had the number two
seed<00:07:28.559> well<00:07:28.830> unfortunately<00:07:29.159> it<00:07:29.550> didn't<00:07:29.849> this
