 and good 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 but he left Charlie's angels' 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 after the first season because 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.880
 according to what she said 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 I wanted to pursue a career more towards 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.259
 cinema wanted to get away from television 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.670
 I wanted to get away from the series the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.410
 producers allowed it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.380
 although later they forced her 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 contract situations to return in 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.580
 later episodes 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.850
 for seasons 3 and 4 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.980

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.130
 appearing in the angels of charlie ' 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.220
 now under the control of the actress who 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.490
 he came to substitute for jose who was the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.920
 young cher actress and the one who played 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.140
 the sister of jill munroe crisis crisis 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.060
 very road and good this act is a model 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.460
 1976 so it's a model of the year of 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.940
 year that the series of 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.960
 TV 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.210
 and well you can see it this has this 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.480
 so striking design the blue stripes 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.190
 that cover it all over the surface what 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.430
 which was quite curious because this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.000
 auto used it mainly used jean 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.040

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.600
 the angels of charlie 'very rarely do 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.460
 they got into high persecutions 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.620
 he was being mistreated or not taken care of 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.810
 practically with pincitas this one does not 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.780
 they got in 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.080
 in dangerous lands they made editions 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.110
 so that the car seemed to run 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.670
 fast and I really did not do it because 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.120
 good being a model of the year what 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.890
 they dealt with a lot of care and just 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.170
 it was until the sunset season that 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.830
 literally if they put it to run in 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.610
 serious in a chase where gray 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.209
 monroe followed you there through a 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.040
 mountainous terrain in this vehicle is 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.739
 it was the good the most memorable moment 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.420
 of the collector in this in the series of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.280

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.360
 this 2013 and have taken advantage of the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.540
 coincidence that appears in the series 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.950

 molds is a high quality product 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.879
 it's worth it frankly 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.729
