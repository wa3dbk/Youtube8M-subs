actually<00:02:15.989> play<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.650> hoping<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.220> minecarts

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
actually play and hoping these minecarts

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.850 
actually play and hoping these minecarts
shoot<00:02:18.090> people<00:02:18.420> around<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.409> actually<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
shoot people around and they actually a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.140 
shoot people around and they actually a
decent<00:02:20.040> way<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.519> around<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:20.790> some

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
decent way to get around because some

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.490 
decent way to get around because some
stages<00:02:21.540> some<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.720> these<00:02:21.780> minecarts<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.409> be

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
stages some of these minecarts can be

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
stages some of these minecarts can be
faster<00:02:23.040> than<00:02:23.459> actual<00:02:23.849> sprinting<00:02:24.510> speed<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
faster than actual sprinting speed so it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.899 
faster than actual sprinting speed so it
does<00:02:25.409> mix<00:02:25.620> things<00:02:25.830> up<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:26.220> bit<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.819> can

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
does mix things up a little bit you can

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.580 
does mix things up a little bit you can
actually<00:02:27.150> fit<00:02:27.269> two<00:02:27.540> people<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:28.049> these<00:02:28.200> carts

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
actually fit two people in these carts

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.800 
actually fit two people in these carts
as<00:02:28.739> well<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.370> crouch<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.909> be<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> lethal

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
as well so if you crouch and be a lethal

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750 
as well so if you crouch and be a lethal
combination<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.250> watches<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.610> back

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
combination one of you watches the back

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.800 
combination one of you watches the back
one<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.180> watch<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.450> front

one if you watch the front

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.390 
one if you watch the front
you<00:02:33.959> should<00:02:34.319> speed<00:02:34.590> through<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.950> map<00:02:35.129> just

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you should speed through the map just

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.890 
you should speed through the map just
gunning<00:02:35.790> people<00:02:35.819> down<00:02:36.090> two<00:02:36.360> absolutely<00:02:36.659> there

gunning people down two absolutely there

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
gunning people down two absolutely there
is<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.860> also<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.129> an<00:02:38.250> easy<00:02:38.430> target<00:02:38.700> if

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
is and you can also be an easy target if

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.160 
is and you can also be an easy target if
the<00:02:39.060> enemies<00:02:39.329> are<00:02:39.360> smart<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.079> very

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the enemies are smart so it's very

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.660 
the enemies are smart so it's very
interesting<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.769> kind<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.099> playstyle<00:02:41.549> they

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
interesting a kind of playstyle they

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.369 
interesting a kind of playstyle they
added<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.120> I've<00:02:42.720> never<00:02:42.840> seen<00:02:43.049> something<00:02:43.230> like

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
added and I've never seen something like

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.319 
added and I've never seen something like
that<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.799> bunch<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.099> minecart<00:02:44.879> speeding<00:02:45.239> around

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
that a bunch of minecart speeding around

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.449 
that a bunch of minecart speeding around
I<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:46.109> any<00:02:46.290> point<00:02:46.650> there's<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:47.010> three

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
I think as any point there's about three

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.099 
I think as any point there's about three
of<00:02:47.579> them<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.940> same<00:02:48.120> time<00:02:48.180> possibly<00:02:48.870> two

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
of them at the same time possibly two

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.990 
of them at the same time possibly two
but<00:02:49.680> yeah<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.310> definitely<00:02:50.609> very

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but yeah that's definitely very

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.089 
but yeah that's definitely very
interesting<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.629> lot<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.590> things<00:02:52.859> also

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
interesting and a lot of things also

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.410 
interesting and a lot of things also
very<00:02:53.370> cool<00:02:53.579> about<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.910> type<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.269> might

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
very cool about this type you might

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.229 
very cool about this type you might
notice<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.079> B<00:02:55.560> flag<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.190> actually<00:02:56.790> moving

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
notice the B flag is actually moving

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.839 
notice the B flag is actually moving
it's<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> platform<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.859> its<00:02:59.069> own<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.519> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
it's on a platform of its own and it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.849 
it's on a platform of its own and it
moves<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.510> down<00:03:00.650> constantly<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.769> you're

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859

entire team spawn on one side they might

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.650 
entire team spawn on one side they might

be able to get access to B and then it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.030 
be able to get access to B and then it
might<00:03:51.780> move<00:03:51.959> up<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.680> little<00:03:52.769> there's

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.559 
move all the way around them up again
those<00:03:55.859> get<00:03:56.099> control<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.419> does

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
those get control and it really does

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
is a very complicated one there's about

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.539 
is a very complicated one there's about
three<00:04:15.569> levels<00:04:15.959> in<00:04:16.199> general<00:04:16.560> possibly<00:04:17.250> four

three levels in general possibly four

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.520 
three levels in general possibly four
and<00:04:17.760> there's<00:04:18.389> lots<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.900> lots<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.349> different

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and there's lots and lots of different

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.620 
and there's lots and lots of different
strange<00:04:20.099> alleyways<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.970> actual<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.389> it's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
strange alleyways the actual is it's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.630 
strange alleyways the actual is it's
quite<00:04:21.840> decent<00:04:22.409> size<00:04:22.590> map<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.039> itself<00:04:23.400> it's

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
quite decent size map in itself it's

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.730 
quite decent size map in itself it's
probably<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.210> probably<00:04:24.570> medium<00:04:25.020> size<00:04:25.289> but

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
probably a probably medium size but

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.440 
probably a probably medium size but
actually<00:04:26.130> engagements<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.789> get<00:04:26.940> into

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
actually engagements you get into

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.700 
actually engagements you get into
are<00:04:27.540> definitely<00:04:28.080> close<00:04:28.320> quarters<00:04:28.620> at<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
are definitely close quarters at the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.440 
are definitely close quarters at the
start<00:04:28.980> this<00:04:29.070> game<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.490> load<00:04:29.850> up<00:04:29.880> when<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.210> Roman

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
start this game I load up when the Roman

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.700 
start this game I load up when the Roman
things<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> assumed<00:04:31.140> are<00:04:31.260> press<00:04:31.440> start<00:04:31.680> on

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
things that I assumed are press start on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.320 
things that I assumed are press start on
the<00:04:31.770> map<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.100> saw<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.670> was<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.850> pretty<00:04:33.060> large

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the map and saw it was a pretty large

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.790 
the map and saw it was a pretty large
map<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.810> expected<00:04:34.290> some<00:04:34.470> long<00:04:34.650> range

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
map so I expected some long range

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.290 
map so I expected some long range
gunfights<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.700> pulled<00:04:35.880> at<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.030> Remington

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
gunfights so I pulled at the Remington

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.360 
gunfights so I pulled at the Remington
and<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.050> getting<00:04:37.320> destroyed<00:04:37.770> those<00:04:38.040> too

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
and I was getting destroyed those too

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.100 
and I was getting destroyed those too
much<00:04:38.550> close<00:04:38.790> quarters<00:04:39.150> action<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.870> Roman

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
much close quarters action the Roman

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.840 
much close quarters action the Roman
team<00:04:40.230> couldn't<00:04:40.530> handle<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.100> close<00:04:41.550> range

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
team couldn't handle the close range

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.670 
team couldn't handle the close range
kind<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.270> SMGs<00:04:42.810> that<00:04:42.990> are<00:04:43.050> rushing<00:04:43.410> me<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:43.650> I

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
kind of SMGs that are rushing me so I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.350 
kind of SMGs that are rushing me so I
put<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.010> vector<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.670> I'm<00:04:44.790> doing<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.210> much

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
put on a vector and I'm doing so much

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.060 
put on a vector and I'm doing so much
better<00:04:45.630> than<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.810> vector<00:04:46.140> it's<00:04:46.530> definitely<00:04:47.040> a

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
better than the vector it's definitely a

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.160 
better than the vector it's definitely a
close<00:04:47.460> range<00:04:47.790> map<00:04:48.060> I'd<00:04:48.210> say<00:04:48.360> all<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.780> maps<00:04:48.990> are

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
close range map I'd say all the maps are

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.900 
close range map I'd say all the maps are
on<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.350> map<00:04:49.410> pack<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.460> think<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.790> would

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
on this map pack and I think it would

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.520 
on this map pack and I think it would
love<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.300> add<00:04:51.450> these<00:04:51.720> very<00:04:52.020> close<00:04:52.260> quarters

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
love to add these very close quarters

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.170 
love to add these very close quarters
maps<00:04:52.800> in<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.040> DLC<00:04:53.370> which<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.640> really<00:04:53.820> like<00:04:54.000> and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
maps in the DLC which I really like and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.150 
maps in the DLC which I really like and
but<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.050> definitely<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.530> close<00:04:55.830> quarter

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
but this is definitely a close quarter

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160 
but this is definitely a close quarter
so<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.280> could<00:04:56.460> recommend<00:04:56.760> using<00:04:57.090> SMG<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.020> for

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
so I could recommend using SMG so for

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.810 
so I could recommend using SMG so for
another<00:04:58.410> vector<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.920> mtar<00:04:59.310> well<00:04:59.760> the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
another vector or the mtar well the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.310 
another vector or the mtar well the
Bizon<00:05:00.060> or<00:05:00.300> something<00:05:00.630> like<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.200> it's

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
Bizon or something like that but it's

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.710 
Bizon or something like that but it's
definitely<00:05:01.500> an<00:05:01.740> SMG<00:05:02.070> map<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:02.940> see<00:05:02.970> most

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
definitely an SMG map and you see most

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.150 
definitely an SMG map and you see most
the<00:05:03.930> engagements<00:05:04.410> there<00:05:04.500> are<00:05:04.560> lots<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.890> very

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
the engagements there are lots of very

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.970 
the engagements there are lots of very
strange<00:05:05.900> verticality<00:05:06.900> points<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:07.530> most<00:05:07.830> of

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
strange verticality points so most of

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.560 
strange verticality points so most of
the<00:05:08.070> points<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.610> will<00:05:08.970> be<00:05:09.000> your<00:05:09.240> cut<00:05:09.330> up<00:05:09.420> up

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
the points that will be your cut up up

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.180 
the points that will be your cut up up
and<00:05:09.720> down<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.110> very<00:05:10.380> you've<00:05:10.680> kind<00:05:10.950> of<00:05:11.010> rather

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
and down is very you've kind of rather

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.500 
and down is very you've kind of rather
you'll<00:05:11.430> get<00:05:11.580> someone<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.940> same<00:05:12.090> level<00:05:12.480> you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
you'll get someone the same level you

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.180 
you'll get someone the same level you
often<00:05:13.290> they'll<00:05:13.410> be<00:05:13.500> going<00:05:13.590> kind<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.890> up<00:05:14.040> a

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
often they'll be going kind of up a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.130 
often they'll be going kind of up a
slope<00:05:14.460> or<00:05:14.670> up<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.000> down<00:05:15.120> some<00:05:15.300> stairs<00:05:15.690> or

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
slope or up and down some stairs or

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.020 
slope or up and down some stairs or
climbing<00:05:16.650> up<00:05:16.680> some<00:05:16.890> objects<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:17.760> of<00:05:17.850> course

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
climbing up some objects but of course

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.370 
climbing up some objects but of course
there's<00:05:18.180> also<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.510> minecart<00:05:19.170> so<00:05:19.290> you

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
there's also the minecart so you

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.570 
there's also the minecart so you
actually<00:05:19.530> knows<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.920> can<00:05:20.070> actually<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.370> hit

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
actually knows you can actually it hit

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.850 
actually knows you can actually it hit
by<00:05:20.730> them<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.120> if<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.900> get<00:05:22.020> hit<00:05:22.200> too<00:05:22.470> much<00:05:22.650> you

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
by them and if you get hit too much you

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.530 
by them and if you get hit too much you
will<00:05:23.010> die<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.280> think<00:05:23.370> if<00:05:23.670> you<00:05:23.760> stand<00:05:24.030> back<00:05:24.270> like

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
will die I think if you stand back like

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.090 
will die I think if you stand back like
in<00:05:24.660> front<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.110> it'll<00:05:25.440> basically<00:05:25.590> push<00:05:25.950> you

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
in front of it it'll basically push you

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.620 
in front of it it'll basically push you
along<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.640> will<00:05:26.730> do<00:05:26.880> like<00:05:27.060> little<00:05:27.270> bits<00:05:27.540> of

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
along and it will do like little bits of

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.990 
along and it will do like little bits of
damage<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.080> might<00:05:28.260> do<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:28.530> 25<00:05:29.100> damage<00:05:29.760> each

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
damage it might do like 25 damage each

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 
damage it might do like 25 damage each
time<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:30.810> if<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:30.960> get<00:05:31.140> here<00:05:31.320> about<00:05:31.470> four<00:05:31.740> times

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
time so if you get here about four times

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.710 
time so if you get here about four times
it<00:05:32.250> will<00:05:32.610> kill<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.150> eventually<00:05:33.300> just

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
it will kill you and eventually just

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.660 
it will kill you and eventually just
flatten<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.260> run<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.560> over<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.370> it<00:05:35.580> is

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
flatten you and run you over but it is

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.490 
flatten you and run you over but it is
easy<00:05:35.910> just<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.150> press<00:05:36.390> a<00:05:36.570> or<00:05:36.750> X<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.170> just<00:05:37.290> climb

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
easy just to press a or X and just climb

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.260 
easy just to press a or X and just climb
onto<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.980> thing<00:05:38.250> itself<00:05:38.580> but<00:05:38.700> if<00:05:38.940> you're<00:05:39.060> weak

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
onto the thing itself but if you're weak

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.120 
onto the thing itself but if you're weak
then<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:39.810> can<00:05:40.050> get<00:05:40.230> hit<00:05:40.410> over<00:05:40.740> I'm<00:05:40.860> not<00:05:41.010> gonna

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
then you can get hit over I'm not gonna

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.590 
then you can get hit over I'm not gonna
like<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.400> did<00:05:41.580> happen<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.970> few<00:05:42.000> times<00:05:42.390> I<00:05:42.540> was

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
like that did happen a few times I was

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.080 
like that did happen a few times I was
very<00:05:43.140> weak<00:05:43.380> after<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.770> gunfight<00:05:44.010> good<00:05:44.670> minecart

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
very weak after a gunfight good minecart

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.910 
very weak after a gunfight good minecart
came<00:05:45.300> out<00:05:45.450> nowhere<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.230> just<00:05:46.260> ran<00:05:46.680> me<00:05:46.710> over

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
came out nowhere and just ran me over

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.580 
came out nowhere and just ran me over
and<00:05:47.460> it's<00:05:48.120> absolutely<00:05:48.330> crazy<00:05:48.780> but<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.260> didn't

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
and it's absolutely crazy but you didn't

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.900 
and it's absolutely crazy but you didn't
watch<00:05:49.710> out<00:05:49.890> for<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.070> minecarts<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.670> keep<00:05:50.790> an

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
watch out for the minecarts and keep an

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.100 
watch out for the minecarts and keep an
eye<00:05:50.970> on<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> mini-map<00:05:51.210> it's<00:05:51.540> pretty<00:05:51.750> simple

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
eye on the mini-map it's pretty simple

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.480 
eye on the mini-map it's pretty simple
just<00:05:52.470> keep<00:05:52.680> an<00:05:52.800> eye<00:05:52.830> on<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:52.980> mini-map<00:05:53.070> every

just keep an eye on the mini-map every

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.440 
just keep an eye on the mini-map every
now<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:53.730> again<00:05:53.760> you<00:05:53.970> should<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.180> doing<00:05:54.360> that

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
now and again you should be doing that

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.090 
now and again you should be doing that
anyway<00:05:54.780> but<00:05:55.350> if<00:05:55.590> keep<00:05:55.770> an<00:05:55.890> eye<00:05:55.950> on<00:05:55.980> the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
mini-map to be able to see it from my

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.790 
mini-map to be able to see it from my
carts<00:05:57.660> come<00:05:57.750> around<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:57.990> corner<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.500> there's

fast and you're kind of head glitching
in<00:06:08.700> this<00:06:08.880> minecart<00:06:09.420> but<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.690> thing<00:06:09.870> isn't

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
in this minecart but the thing isn't

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.630 
in this minecart but the thing isn't
very<00:06:10.620> armoured<00:06:10.950> you<00:06:11.040> can<00:06:11.160> shoot<00:06:11.340> through<00:06:11.550> it

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
very armoured you can shoot through it

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.070 
very armoured you can shoot through it
pretty<00:06:11.790> easily<00:06:12.060> especially<00:06:12.330> if<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:12.870> put<00:06:12.990> an

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
pretty easily especially if you put an

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.690 
pretty easily especially if you put an
armor-piercing<00:06:13.560> round<00:06:13.950> you<00:06:14.250> shoot<00:06:14.580> through

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
armor-piercing round you shoot through

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.310 
armor-piercing round you shoot through
it<00:06:14.760> very<00:06:15.000> easily<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.750> are<00:06:15.960> also<00:06:16.140> a

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
it very easily and you are also a

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.840 
it very easily and you are also a
sitting<00:06:16.770> target<00:06:16.950> everyone<00:06:17.310> knows<00:06:17.520> where<00:06:17.760> you

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
sitting target everyone knows where you

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.920 
sitting target everyone knows where you
are<00:06:18.000> everyone<00:06:18.300> knows<00:06:18.420> where<00:06:18.570> you're<00:06:18.660> coming

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
are everyone knows where you're coming

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.280 
are everyone knows where you're coming
from

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
from

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.900 
from
so<00:06:19.590> it's<00:06:19.800> a<00:06:19.860> pretty<00:06:20.070> easy<00:06:20.340> target<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.730> there's

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
so it's a pretty easy target and there's

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.820 
so it's a pretty easy target and there's
also<00:06:21.030> a<00:06:21.150> part<00:06:21.420> where<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:21.900> go<00:06:22.140> up<00:06:22.320> this<00:06:22.500> kind<00:06:22.770> of

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
also a part where you go up this kind of

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.620 
also a part where you go up this kind of
Hill<00:06:23.130> on<00:06:23.280> an<00:06:23.400> incline<00:06:23.820> so<00:06:24.150> where<00:06:24.360> you'll<00:06:24.480> be

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
Hill on an incline so where you'll be

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.110 
Hill on an incline so where you'll be
very<00:06:24.840> very<00:06:24.960> slowly<00:06:25.470> moving<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.160> pretty<00:06:27.000> much

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
very very slowly moving and pretty much

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.270 
very very slowly moving and pretty much
a<00:06:27.300> sitting<00:06:27.750> duck<00:06:27.780> for<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.380> enemies<00:06:28.710> so<00:06:28.920> make

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
a sitting duck for the enemies so make

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.980 
a sitting duck for the enemies so make
sure<00:06:29.310> you're<00:06:29.910> keeping<00:06:30.060> these<00:06:30.360> tips<00:06:30.630> in<00:06:30.840> mind

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
sure you're keeping these tips in mind
