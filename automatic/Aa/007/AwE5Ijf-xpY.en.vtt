flowers which are violas I'll get into

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
flowers which are violas I'll get into
that<00:00:35.940> later<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.040> England<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that later so when I was in England I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.260 
that later so when I was in England I
purchased<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.230> seeds<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:41.399> didn't<00:00:42.090> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
purchased some seeds I didn't really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.240 
purchased some seeds I didn't really
expect<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> back<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.010> me

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
expect them to make it back with me

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.959 
expect them to make it back with me
through<00:00:44.520> customs<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.300> declared<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
through customs but I declared them and

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
through customs but I declared them and
then<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.450> let<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.079> through<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.440> me

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
then they just let them through with me

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.939 
then they just let them through with me
so<00:00:49.800> whatever<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.670> plan<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.800> sewing<00:00:52.800> these

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
so whatever I don't plan on sewing these

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.450 
so whatever I don't plan on sewing these
seeds<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.530> because<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.649> move<00:00:56.039> around<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.340> lot

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
seeds but because I move around a lot

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
seeds but because I move around a lot
it's<00:00:56.640> difficult<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.300> me<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:59.359> here's<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's difficult for me but here's one of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.380 
it's difficult for me but here's one of
my<00:01:01.079> Primrose<00:01:01.800> plants<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> pot<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.800 
it wasn't really that strong of a pink
which<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> why<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.299> cuz<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.570> really

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
which is why I got it cuz I don't really

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
which is why I got it cuz I don't really
like<00:01:12.990> pink<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:15.030> cool<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.500> put<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like pink but it's cool so I put it in a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.620 
like pink but it's cool so I put it in a
pot<00:01:17.580> basically<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> grow<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:20.630> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pot basically when you grow these you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
pot basically when you grow these you
want<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.650> moist<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:25.189> never

let<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.580> dry<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:26.820> cuz<00:01:27.210> otherwise<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.720> will

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
let them dry out cuz otherwise they will

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.899 
let them dry out cuz otherwise they will
die<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> happen

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
leaf right here it's turning yellow

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
leaf right here it's turning yellow
maybe<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.290> little

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
maybe you can see that maybe a little

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.390 
maybe you can see that maybe a little
focus<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.130> know

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
focus I don't know

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.220 
focus I don't know
but<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.150> don't<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.660> happen<00:01:54.900> so

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
but you don't want that to happen so

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.120 
but you don't want that to happen so
keep<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> shade<00:01:56.240> they<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.390> Hardy<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
keep them in the shade they are Hardy to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.610 
keep them in the shade they are Hardy to
USDA<00:01:59.130> zone<00:01:59.580> six<00:02:00.090> which<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.480> very<00:02:00.900> cold<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
USDA zone six which is very cold I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.040 
USDA zone six which is very cold I
believe<00:02:02.370> it<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.550> get<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.240> negative<00:02:03.660> 10

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
believe it can get up like negative 10

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.800 
believe it can get up like negative 10
negative<00:02:04.370> something<00:02:05.370> just<00:02:05.790> very<00:02:06.270> cold<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
negative something just very cold so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
negative something just very cold so
they're<00:02:07.020> very<00:02:07.260> Hardy<00:02:08.220> plants<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.910> keep

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
they're very Hardy plants but just keep

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.950 
they're very Hardy plants but just keep
them<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:10.320> moistened<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.130> watered<00:02:11.960> um

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
them well moistened and well watered um

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.360 
them well moistened and well watered um
so<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.760> leaves<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.570> edible<00:02:16.200> I've<00:02:16.770> heard<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
so the leaves are edible I've heard and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.770 
so the leaves are edible I've heard and
so<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.730> flowers<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.540> want<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
so are the flowers but I don't want to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
so are the flowers but I don't want to
try<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.530> don't<00:02:19.590> want<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.880> take<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
try it because I don't want to take a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.480 
try it because I don't want to take a
chance<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.930> I'm<00:02:22.200> pretty<00:02:22.890> sure<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.340> are

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
chance but I'm pretty sure that they are

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.900 
chance but I'm pretty sure that they are
edible<00:02:23.670> they<00:02:24.240> do<00:02:24.300> smell<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.990> lettuce<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
edible they do smell like lettuce if you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.680 
edible they do smell like lettuce if you
you<00:02:27.450> know<00:02:27.570> take<00:02:28.110> them<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.470> crush<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.250> but

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you know take them and crush them but

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.010 
you know take them and crush them but
whatever<00:02:30.860> these<00:02:31.860> plants<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> variety<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
whatever these plants have a variety of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
have a blue one outside I've seen white

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
have a blue one outside I've seen white
yellow<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.420> haven't<00:02:51.810> seen<00:02:51.959> orange<00:02:52.410> maybe<00:02:52.770> it's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
yellow I haven't seen orange maybe it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.810 
yellow I haven't seen orange maybe it's
like<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> golden<00:02:53.880> yellow<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.370> lot<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
like a golden yellow but just a lot of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.580 
like a golden yellow but just a lot of
colors<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.040> yeah<00:02:59.040> that's<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.459> cool<00:02:59.670> so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
colors and yeah that's really cool so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.660 
colors and yeah that's really cool so
when<00:03:01.590> they've<00:03:01.769> been<00:03:01.800> flowering<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.489> flower

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
when they've been flowering they flower

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.640 
when they've been flowering they flower
for<00:03:03.000> quite<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> long<00:03:03.600> time<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.900> guess<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.500> like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
for quite a long time I guess it's like

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.280 
for quite a long time I guess it's like
from<00:03:05.040> fall<00:03:05.400> through<00:03:05.910> spring<00:03:07.489> you'll<00:03:08.489> get

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
from fall through spring you'll get

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.880 
from fall through spring you'll get
these<00:03:10.290> spent<00:03:10.769> flowers<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:12.600> that

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
these spent flowers you can see that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.590 
these spent flowers you can see that
what<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.920> want<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:15.500> pinch<00:03:16.500> those<00:03:16.739> off

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
what you want to do is pinch those off

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.910 
what you want to do is pinch those off
because<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:19.019> happens<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:19.470> plants<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:21.920> when

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
because what happens with plants is when

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.120 
because what happens with plants is when
the<00:03:23.070> flower<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.400> pollinated<00:03:24.360> by<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.019> bee<00:03:25.530> or<00:03:25.560> an

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
the flower is pollinated by a bee or an

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.410 
the flower is pollinated by a bee or an
insect<00:03:26.489> or<00:03:26.640> by<00:03:26.880> itself<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.820> seeds<00:03:29.970> start<00:03:30.300> to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
insect or by itself the seeds start to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.100 
insect or by itself the seeds start to
develop<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:32.400> seeds<00:03:32.700> produce<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.660> plant

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
develop and the seeds produce a plant

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.550 
develop and the seeds produce a plant
hormone

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
hormone

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.210 
hormone
I<00:03:34.769> believe<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.670> gibberellin<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:37.410> tells

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
I believe it's gibberellin that tells

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.900 
I believe it's gibberellin that tells
the<00:03:38.489> plant<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:40.260> stop<00:03:40.560> making<00:03:41.070> flowers<00:03:41.459> because

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
the plant to stop making flowers because

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600 
the plant to stop making flowers because
you<00:03:42.360> know<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.750> plant<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.220> flowering<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
you know if the plant is flowering and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.160 
you know if the plant is flowering and
it's<00:03:44.730> already<00:03:44.970> making<00:03:45.120> seeds<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.930> plant

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
it's already making seeds the plant

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.050 
it's already making seeds the plant
wants<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.709> devote<00:03:47.010> its<00:03:47.250> energy<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.850> seed

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
wants to devote its energy to seed

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.820 
wants to devote its energy to seed
production<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.690> fruit<00:03:48.870> production<00:03:48.989> not

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
production and fruit production not

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.310 
production and fruit production not
making<00:03:50.280> more<00:03:50.400> flowers<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.959> same<00:03:52.140> thing

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
making more flowers the same thing

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.509 
making more flowers the same thing
happens<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.709> cucumbers<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.430> ever

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
happens in cucumbers if you're ever

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.789 
happens in cucumbers if you're ever
going<00:03:53.700> cucumbers<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.380> every<00:03:55.769> time

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
going cucumbers you know that every time

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.199 
going cucumbers you know that every time
you<00:03:56.040> pick<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> cucumbers<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:57.030> more

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
you pick the cucumbers the more

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.330 
you pick the cucumbers the more
cucumbers<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> plant<00:03:58.080> produces<00:03:58.340> same

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
cucumbers of the plant produces same

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
cucumbers of the plant produces same
thing<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.660> more<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> pick<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.230> flowers

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
thing so the more you pick the flowers

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.820 
thing so the more you pick the flowers
the<00:04:01.739> more<00:04:01.920> flowers<00:04:02.220> are<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.489> come

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
the more flowers are going to come

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.800 
the more flowers are going to come
so<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.850> just<00:04:04.620> perpetuates<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.860> whole<00:04:06.010> thing

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
so that just perpetuates the whole thing

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.270 
so that just perpetuates the whole thing
most<00:04:07.810> primroses<00:04:08.170> have<00:04:08.470> yellow<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> center

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
most primroses have yellow in the center

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.250 
most primroses have yellow in the center
I<00:04:09.640> don't<00:04:09.940> know<00:04:10.030> if<00:04:10.090> that's<00:04:10.270> intentional<00:04:10.720> or

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
I don't know if that's intentional or

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.560 
I don't know if that's intentional or
the<00:04:11.410> breeders<00:04:11.710> can't<00:04:12.070> get<00:04:12.850> rid<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.300> but<00:04:13.540> I

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
the breeders can't get rid of that but I

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.860 
the breeders can't get rid of that but I
don't<00:04:13.840> mind<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.350> yellow

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
don't mind the yellow

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.550 
don't mind the yellow
yeah<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.049> pinch<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.560> flowers<00:04:18.190> off<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
yeah just pinch the flowers off and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.040 
yeah just pinch the flowers off and
sometimes<00:04:20.560> they<00:04:20.799> smell<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:23.460> yeah<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:25.050> this

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
sometimes they smell good yeah so this

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.010 
sometimes they smell good yeah so this
one<00:04:26.350> needs<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.420> sometimes

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
one needs to go and you know sometimes

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
really tell but there are a lot of

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.830 
really tell but there are a lot of

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
flowers in there coming up yeah so after

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.040 
flowers in there coming up yeah so after
the<00:04:47.350> spring<00:04:47.530> comes<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.220> goes<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.870> flower

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the spring comes and goes and the flower

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.050 
the spring comes and goes and the flower
stops<00:04:51.150> flowering<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:53.140> do<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.260> do<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:54.520> can

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
stops flowering what do you do you can

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.030 
stops flowering what do you do you can
you<00:04:55.870> have<00:04:55.960> two<00:04:56.140> options<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.680> couple<00:04:56.920> options

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
you have two options a couple options

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.240 
you have two options a couple options
you<00:04:57.570> can<00:04:58.570> keep<00:04:58.840> it<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.200> pot<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.650> keep

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
you can keep it in the pot and just keep

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.190 
you can keep it in the pot and just keep
it<00:05:00.400> well<00:05:00.550> watered<00:05:00.580> during<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> summer<00:05:01.450> no<00:05:02.020> big

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
it well watered during the summer no big

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.100 
it well watered during the summer no big
deal<00:05:02.410> or<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.700> can<00:05:03.940> pull<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.630> out<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> pot

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
deal or you can pull it out of the pot

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.500 
deal or you can pull it out of the pot
and<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:06.160> can<00:05:06.370> divide<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.760> because<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> lot<00:05:07.450> of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
and you can divide it because a lot of

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.300 
and you can divide it because a lot of
the<00:05:07.570> times<00:05:07.750> what<00:05:07.900> will<00:05:08.050> happen<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:09.100> one

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
the times what will happen is this one

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.860 
the times what will happen is this one
is<00:05:09.900> coming<00:05:10.900> up<00:05:11.020> here<00:05:11.320> too<00:05:11.730> it<00:05:12.730> will<00:05:12.940> split<00:05:13.750> up

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
is coming up here too it will split up

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.070 
is coming up here too it will split up
into<00:05:14.050> two<00:05:14.410> separate<00:05:14.950> plants<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:16.750> can<00:05:16.900> see

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
into two separate plants and you can see

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.930 
into two separate plants and you can see
the<00:05:17.230> little<00:05:17.380> rosette<00:05:17.890> forming<00:05:18.310> forming<00:05:18.610> their

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the little rosette forming forming their

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.409 
the little rosette forming forming their
new<00:05:19.630> leaves<00:05:19.870> are<00:05:20.140> coming<00:05:20.950> out<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.910> that's

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
new leaves are coming out so that's

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.300 
new leaves are coming out so that's
actually<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.870> new<00:05:23.050> plant<00:05:23.320> as<00:05:23.560> long<00:05:23.950> as<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.160> have

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
actually a new plant as long as you have

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.150 
actually a new plant as long as you have
a<00:05:24.340> leaf<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.330> root<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:26.290> can<00:05:26.530> have<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:26.980> new

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
a leaf and a root you can have a new

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.070 
a leaf and a root you can have a new
plant<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:27.669> this<00:05:27.820> is<00:05:27.970> an<00:05:28.090> easy<00:05:28.270> way<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.540> multiply

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
plant so this is an easy way to multiply

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.380 
plant so this is an easy way to multiply
them<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.500> plants<00:05:29.770> do<00:05:30.580> this<00:05:30.760> themselves<00:05:31.000> but

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
them the plants do this themselves but

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.760 
them the plants do this themselves but
you<00:05:31.450> can<00:05:31.600> actually<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:31.900> pull<00:05:32.530> them<00:05:32.650> apart

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
you can actually just pull them apart

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.000 
you can actually just pull them apart
and<00:05:33.130> then<00:05:33.310> have<00:05:34.110> two<00:05:35.110> plants<00:05:35.440> instead<00:05:35.650> of<00:05:35.830> one

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
and then have two plants instead of one

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.610 
and then have two plants instead of one
but<00:05:36.850> left<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.600> their<00:05:37.720> own<00:05:37.750> planted<00:05:38.380> in<00:05:38.500> the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
but left to their own planted in the

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.710 
but left to their own planted in the
ground<00:05:38.830> they<00:05:39.070> will<00:05:39.100> just<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.790> know<00:05:39.820> get

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
ground they will just you know get

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.030 
ground they will just you know get
bigger<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.050> bigger<00:05:41.169> like<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:41.470> mushroom<00:05:41.800> over

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
bigger and bigger like a mushroom over

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.720 
bigger and bigger like a mushroom over
the<00:05:42.220> years<00:05:42.419> but<00:05:43.419> pretty<00:05:44.410> easy<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.890> grow<00:05:45.040> so<00:05:45.490> far

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
the years but pretty easy to grow so far

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.220 
the years but pretty easy to grow so far
here<00:05:46.000> in<00:05:46.030> Northern<00:05:46.419> California<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.990> haven't

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
here in Northern California I haven't

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.230 
here in Northern California I haven't
had<00:05:47.320> very<00:05:47.440> many<00:05:47.620> problems<00:05:47.860> besides<00:05:48.700> maybe

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
had very many problems besides maybe

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.830 
had very many problems besides maybe
being<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.990> little<00:05:50.169> bit<00:05:50.320> too<00:05:50.680> dry<00:05:51.840> overall

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
being a little bit too dry overall

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.740 
being a little bit too dry overall
they're<00:05:53.050> pretty<00:05:53.230> easy<00:05:53.470> I'm<00:05:53.800> glad<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.750> was

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
they're pretty easy I'm glad that I was

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.180 
they're pretty easy I'm glad that I was
interested<00:05:56.020> in<00:05:56.260> them<00:05:56.440> after<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:56.740> went<00:05:56.890> on<00:05:57.040> that

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
interested in them after I went on that

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.700 
interested in them after I went on that
trip<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:57.520> saw<00:05:57.880> them<00:05:58.120> growing<00:05:58.390> because<00:05:58.870> I

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
trip and saw them growing because I

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.920 
trip and saw them growing because I
noticed<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> climate<00:06:01.180> in<00:06:01.330> England<00:06:01.750> was

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
noticed that the climate in England was

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.110 
noticed that the climate in England was
very<00:06:02.110> similar<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:03.370> weather<00:06:03.580> up<00:06:04.030> here

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
very similar to the weather up here

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.870 
very similar to the weather up here
during<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.290> winter<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:06.310> was<00:06:06.340> at<00:06:06.550> home<00:06:06.610> they

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
during the winter and I was at home they

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.210 
during the winter and I was at home they
probably<00:06:07.630> not<00:06:07.930> too<00:06:08.050> hard<00:06:08.230> to<00:06:08.290> grow<00:06:08.500> they're

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
probably not too hard to grow they're

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.060 
probably not too hard to grow they're
not<00:06:09.370> so<00:06:10.440> hopefully<00:06:11.440> that's<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.740> little<00:06:11.890> bit

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
not so hopefully that's a little bit

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.730 
not so hopefully that's a little bit
helpful<00:06:12.550> hopefully<00:06:13.000> you<00:06:13.479> could<00:06:13.690> actually<00:06:14.260> see
