times over the course of these three

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
times over the course of these three
days<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> pay

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
days and you pretty much have to pay

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460 
days and you pretty much have to pay
attention<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.479> well<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.869> strict<00:01:40.200> attention

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
attention to well very strict attention

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
attention to well very strict attention
to<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:40.890> they're<00:01:41.040> happening<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to when they're happening because if you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
to when they're happening because if you
miss<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.329> can't<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:42.930> pick<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

miss one you can't really pick up the
story<00:01:43.590> again<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> you'll<00:01:44.280> probably<00:01:44.490> just

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
story again and you'll probably just

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.600

want<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> reload<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.450> game<00:01:45.750> after<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
want to reload your game after that so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
want to reload your game after that so
in<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> sense<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
in that sense you don't have all that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.210 
in that sense you don't have all that
much<00:01:50.009> free<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.939> around<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.570> check

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
much free time to go around and check

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
much free time to go around and check
everything<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.670> that's<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.810> sort<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
everything out and that's that's sort of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
everything out and that's that's sort of
made<00:01:55.470> its<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.460> difficult<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
made its it's even more difficult to to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
made its it's even more difficult to to
see<00:01:57.750> everything<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> first<00:01:58.350> time<00:01:58.590> through

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
see everything the first time through

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.139 
see everything the first time through
just<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> save<00:01:59.579> system<00:01:59.969> there's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
just because the save system there's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
just because the save system there's
only<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.509> slot<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.079> save<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.409> game<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.740> every

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
only one slot to save your game so every

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.910 
only one slot to save your game so every
time<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> save<00:02:02.540> whether<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> safe

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
time you save whether it's in the safe

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
time you save whether it's in the safe
room<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> security<00:02:05.969> room<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.329> any<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
room in the security room or any of the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.619 
room in the security room or any of the
mall<00:02:07.619> bathrooms<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> overwrite

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
mall bathrooms it's going to overwrite

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.570 
mall bathrooms it's going to overwrite
the<00:02:09.869> same<00:02:10.050> slot<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.590> there's<00:02:10.770> no<00:02:10.890> real<00:02:11.129> going

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the same slot so there's no real going

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.450 
the same slot so there's no real going
back

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460

which cancels your your story progress

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.570 
which cancels your your story progress
basically<00:03:01.360> but<00:03:01.690> it'll<00:03:01.990> keep<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.950> statistics

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
basically but it'll keep your statistics

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580 
basically but it'll keep your statistics
for<00:03:03.820> Frank<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.020> start<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> story

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
for Frank so that you start the story

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.200 
for Frank so that you start the story
mode<00:03:05.860> over<00:03:06.010> with<00:03:06.400> all<00:03:06.550> these<00:03:06.640> augmented

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
mode over with all these augmented

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.760 
mode over with all these augmented
abilities<00:03:07.600> making<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.050> easier<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.620> move

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
abilities making it easier to move

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.800 
abilities making it easier to move
through<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.730> dead<00:03:10.090> rising<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.450> definitely

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
through and so dead rising is definitely

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.120 
through and so dead rising is definitely
a<00:03:10.870> game<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> need<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.710> play<00:03:11.890> through

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
a game that you need to play through

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.130 
a game that you need to play through
multiple<00:03:12.670> times<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.690> everything

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
multiple times to really see everything

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.720 
multiple times to really see everything
and<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.950> know<00:03:14.980> that's<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.310> really<00:03:15.550> such<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
and you know that's not really such a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.030 
and you know that's not really such a
bad<00:03:15.850> thing<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.320> lot<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.620> fun<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.890> do

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
bad thing it's it's a lot of fun to do

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.620 
bad thing it's it's a lot of fun to do
the<00:03:18.280> first<00:03:18.490> time<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.790> get<00:03:18.970> through<00:03:19.240> you're

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the first time you get through you're

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.910 
the first time you get through you're
definitely<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.470> charge

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
definitely going to want to charge

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.410 
definitely going to want to charge
