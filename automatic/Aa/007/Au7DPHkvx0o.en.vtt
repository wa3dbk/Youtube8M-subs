00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.589
 Good people, I want to show you here. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.910
 which is what is happening already 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.219
 about three months I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 I've been going through this one for that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.930
 problem is a tv of the brand lg model 32 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.519
 l of 350 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 I bought this tv at about minus 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 from two years to less than two years is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.579
 she was in perfect working order 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.530
 in images she of excellent quality 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.379
 pick up hd channels and analog channels 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 also perfect and began to present 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.969
 a message on the screen of an update 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.700
 software 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 after numerous attempts following the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:02.370
 steps that the TV was undermining and without success 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 is to contact the staff of the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:13.500
 staff and the staff min. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.439
 schuil to download from their site a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.759
 update that was there for me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:27.270
 update the first old era 03.04 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:34.520
 point 03 and the update available in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 site was the era is not the 0 3 point 05.04 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 then you can download purposes according to 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.540
 with what I was being excluded right? 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.329
 I downloaded the site update 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.259
 in a folder created with the name of agreement 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.520
 that was to power the system on tv reads 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:00.740
 I put it in the pen drive and put it in natv 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.280
 after doing so countless attempts 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.320
 will be able to update this software 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.910
 What happened? 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.300
 my hope was that this 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.910
 update 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.660
 Standing is not some benefits but 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.590
 unfortunately nothing was made worse 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 as you see here in images 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.070
 this update does not provide 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:33.960
 plus the Portuguese language but only 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:38.590
 in English Spanish French and Chinese is 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.110
 she is not in the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.030
 people are going to have her scan 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.930
 of the channels, right? 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.530
 the tuning of channels it does not find 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.800
 do not tune to the hd channels is only 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.560
 analogue channels and as such 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.150
 What are you seeing, the image is 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.870
 each key is black and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 white and this is on any channel, right? 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.580
 Look at where we put her 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.850
 will stay 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.260
 in the same way she neither colored nor 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:22.720
 not even the color she gives 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:26.680
 There are countless situations I've already tried. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.510
 all have now and finally went into 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.300
 contact with the lg and the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.080
 The attendants there met me 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.020
 Attendant is not very educated but 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:47.530
 unfortunately the solution they give me is 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.670
 I pick up the tv and take it to the tour 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.870
 technical 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 but when I questioned and I was 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.510
 short 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.440
 due to the TV is already almost two years ago 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.040
 This does not mean that the guarantee of a 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.170
 year if I did not make the extended warranty 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.660
 then lose the warranty is over what 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.489
 happens now I have to take the course will 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.510
 have to get out of my pocket concert 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.910
 something that was actually an effect 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.489
 provided by lg itself 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.730
 so I'm here making this alert 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.940
 For who you are? 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.610
 that have LG's very careful 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.780
 time to update this software 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.510
 because this is a virus it is not about 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.660
 update as because even a 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.640
 for example girl who helped me to lg 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.290
 people have updates that are 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.890
 downloaded to your computer to 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.590
 antivirus and bring benefit and not 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.410
 This is what happened to me, right? 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.720
 and so I'm coming to the conclusion that 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.760
 this update was in fact she did not 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.730
 It's a virus, you're the one who calls me. 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.040
 attention is that this is going to happen 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.050
 approximately in the 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.870
 that my 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.400
 my warranty just so it's much 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.640
 coincidence if it can be called 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.080
 this coincidence, right? 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.940
 but you do not bring the situation 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.160
 so that the consumer does not mark now 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.660
 with this expense of having to take the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.210
 device authorized for use with 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.670
 sure will have the cost of it and will 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.500
 Who is going to pay is going to be me but for 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.510
 something that if tv had like me 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.570
 I explained that the girl had given a 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.070
 normal defect the tv was embroidering a 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.280
 default fine is one thing 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.070
 happens is a device but caused 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.440
 by a software company I think 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.850
 who should rather have responsibility 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.490
 would be company 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.370
 but as the attendants themselves told me 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.210
 We do not see ships in this 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.520
 situation 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.660
 so here is the alert so that you 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.480
 be careful 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:10.380
 I repeat, it's a LG TV, and mine is mine. 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.870
 model 32 l of 350 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.810
 but I believe that there must be others 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.580
 models too and these models will ask 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.160
 Do you know what's going to happen then? 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.160
 very careful about this okay
