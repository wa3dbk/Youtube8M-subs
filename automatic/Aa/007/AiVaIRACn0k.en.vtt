there's only how many of those in the

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.580 
there's only how many of those in the
world<00:05:45.700> 1300<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:46.840> they<00:05:46.930> were<00:05:47.020> two<00:05:47.229> there<00:05:47.470> was

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
world 1300 and they were two there was

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.290 
world 1300 and they were two there was
only<00:05:47.710> 2<00:05:47.950> left<00:05:48.130> by<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.400> time<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:48.610> got<00:05:48.820> this<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.240> I

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
only 2 left by the time I got this so I

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.330 
only 2 left by the time I got this so I
think<00:05:49.450> there's<00:05:49.630> only<00:05:49.780> one

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.780 
I might end up leaving the store so you
probably<00:05:52.620> don't<00:05:53.010> have<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.160> chance<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.520> getting
