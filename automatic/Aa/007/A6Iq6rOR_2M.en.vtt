00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 a few days ago cristina from times of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.790
 papers called xunta that I have my 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.620
 case and I love to gossip what 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 that there are the other narrows so if 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 we show that there is in mine that is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.309
 the most unexpected random and sometimes 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.080
 useless so we put on like it's not because 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.080
 I'm going to open my studio 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 because this little cloud quotes with a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 mustache and I fell in love it seems like it's super 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 small but it's not super wide and if I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.230
 I like a lot so I can almost carry 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 my right to pay very well this is my 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 the one that he used normally this is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.360
 my university card as you will see 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.360
 it has no mystery 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 has been modified so much for 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.960
 teachers when this is my pen the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.560
 mine is a wonderful script super good 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.300
 has a super chubby tip is super 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.170
 ok the quote that he used the royal blue 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 blanquita 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.470
 in the peak a bit the worm to see it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.330
 the one of christina and good a pen without 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.979
 I love writing with the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.630
 notes when I'm studying about 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.680
 any clarification because it is here 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.450
 hello kitty and how is it without girl and 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.649
 also before I used the star 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.649
 Well, to cover the issues 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310
 accustomed to it is framed 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 Typical these are long but how was it going 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.970
 undoing the plastic I let you go 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.750
 little things and we left the goals of the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.700
 plastic puppy stitch so I've 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.200
 hooked is already perfect 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.790
 now I have these I'm changing the brand 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.590
 I'm not really faithful to one of these 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.270
 are the changes with westwood those of my 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 mother I had it out there I chose it is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.240
 plus 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.240
 so it has a chubby tip 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.790
 and then they have a finite point 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.380
 yes 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 and that was good for me because with 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 the finite point I write the name of the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 theme and then with the chubby tip I do 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.440
 the famous 9 days and in this case 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.040
 I have 4 subjects that is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.560
 misleading mercantile 2 civil 7 property 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.500
 intellectual and mercantile 1 then I have 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 mechanical pencils as you can see I do not have a 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.590
 place I say I do not have here tips 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.390
 because what I have is they look from the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.950
 petitioning great little guy so do not 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.510
 I have a receipt for it because they are 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.750
 a fussy and whole tip 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:41.110
 pencil is not sharp because I have a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.970
 friend I have one two and three black balls 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.500
 because it's never enough I'm very 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.000
 maniac and I'm afraid to stay without 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.370
 ink in an exam and that stresses me 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 a lot so I'm cautious I have three and 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.300
 blue I have two I have two typix one that 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.580
 it's pointed out well the other one that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.070
 They are giving it take about four years 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.870
 paper made is incredibly durable not 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.700
 I swear to you that what I have from 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.270
 the beginning of the race without exaggerating 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.680
 get a green pen I have a red pen 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.360
 of paper I love this brand 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.590
 I have a pink pen because 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.450
 and those who know me 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.160
 this is I love it has a super tip 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.760
 chubby are very nice to write 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.650
 they had a pack of blue purple green and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.800
 pink but I do not have them scattered 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.230
 my house I have mines of 0-5 for him 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.030
 it's also obvious this but from ossa fire 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.040
 the first want to do exams later 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.750
 I have pincitas of these that as you will see 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.129
 they are colors no matter if it is clear 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.690
 but I think that used by the code 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.370
 civil but I have amended and a little 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.140
 They are super cute little stones 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.110
 pastel colors and brought them by others 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.849
 points or whatever comes up I take a lot of 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.410
 Inks like you see some pancakes that are worth 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.360
 for milan and I thought yes but good 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.980
 He touched the converter motorcycles 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.840
 blue color and then he called the ink 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.170
 from him to me is not worth it because basically the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 head and west if you see is more beautiful 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.560
 I have two good publics you never know 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.660
 when are we going to be able to use are we going 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.879
 Spain I have a lot of clips in shape 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.950
 very swindon heart are already very useful 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.930
 and finally a safety pin that I do not know 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.730
 how you see is a little bitchy because 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.140
 I recently had to change the red cop 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.090
 because with the model now I used this 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.680
 pilot loose painted gel I do not know why 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.140
 what I do not like at all you're a boli this is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.180
 everything I have 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.060
 curiosity and that you liked the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.209
 amount of bullshit I carry in my 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.650
