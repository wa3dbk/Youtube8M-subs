00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
you how to duplicate powered rails BAM

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.460 
you how to duplicate powered rails BAM
alright<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.480> didn't<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> chance<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.260> make<00:00:19.410> a

What did he say something about
confusing<00:00:42.780> pulsar's<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.680> something<00:00:44.160> who

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
confusing pulsar's or something who

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
confusing pulsar's or something who
knows<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.300> late<00:00:45.860> alright<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> made<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
knows and it's late alright so I made a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
knows and it's late alright so I made a
couple<00:00:47.579> different<00:00:47.760> posters<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:49.170> were

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
couple different posters on some were

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
couple different posters on some were
working<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.370> efficiently<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.000> others

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
working and not as efficiently as others

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.049 
working and not as efficiently as others
and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.399> actually<00:00:53.610> worked

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and then this one here actually worked

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
and then this one here actually worked
pretty<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.809> let<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.289> show<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.469> how<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pretty well so let me show you how to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
pretty well so let me show you how to
build<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> Pulsar<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> block<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
build the Pulsar so you put a block in a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
build the Pulsar so you put a block in a
block<00:00:59.449> then<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:01.280> dust<00:01:02.280> dust<00:01:02.699> dust<00:01:02.850> dust<00:01:03.449> dust

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
block then you dust dust dust dust dust

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.880 
block then you dust dust dust dust dust
and<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> pulsar<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> we'll<00:01:07.710> put<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and you have a pulsar and we'll put a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.719 
and you have a pulsar and we'll put a
sticky<00:01:08.250> piston<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.510> goes<00:01:09.659> crazy<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
sticky piston here it goes crazy and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.800 
sticky piston here it goes crazy and
then<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> hole<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.729> will<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:15.509> all

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
then I put a hole here I will get all

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
then I put a hole here I will get all
but<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.340> powered<00:01:17.700> rails<00:01:22.460> all

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
but one actually two powered rails all

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.140 
but one actually two powered rails all
right

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
right

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150 
right
and<00:01:25.480> I<00:01:25.870> one<00:01:26.020> survival<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.740> works<00:01:26.920> on

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
and I one survival in the works on

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.280 
and I one survival in the works on
creative<00:01:27.580> which<00:01:28.120> I<00:01:28.270> guess<00:01:28.300> would<00:01:28.660> point<00:01:29.020> then

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
creative which I guess would point then

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.920 
creative which I guess would point then
right<00:01:29.500> but<00:01:29.740> yeah<00:01:30.580> it's<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.940> survival<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.540> place

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
right but yeah it's a survival I place

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.620 
right but yeah it's a survival I place
one<00:01:31.960> down<00:01:32.500> here<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.010> then<00:01:33.910> I<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.390> try<00:01:34.600> to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
one down here and then I just try to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.480 
one down here and then I just try to
catch<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.470> just<00:01:35.830> hold<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.190> down<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.280> then

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
catch it I just hold it down and then

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.080 
catch it I just hold it down and then
yeah<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:41.350> crazy<00:01:41.970> spin<00:01:42.970> out<00:01:43.300> powered<00:01:44.020> rails<00:01:45.090> so

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
yeah go crazy spin out powered rails so

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.400 
yeah go crazy spin out powered rails so
I<00:01:46.120> don't<00:01:46.360> know<00:01:46.450> if<00:01:46.540> this<00:01:46.660> is<00:01:46.720> what<00:01:47.020> he<00:01:47.170> meant
