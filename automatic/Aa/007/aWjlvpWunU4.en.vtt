here<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> arms<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.049> it's<00:02:26.260> kind<00:02:27.010> of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
here for the arms but it's kind of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.100 
here for the arms but it's kind of
not<00:02:27.610> let<00:02:28.150> me<00:02:28.209> see<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.629> zoom<00:02:28.659> in<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.019> little

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
not let me see if I can zoom in a little

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.530 
not let me see if I can zoom in a little
bit<00:02:29.260> more<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.040> epic<00:02:30.489> masterpiece<00:02:30.670> but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
bit more on this epic masterpiece but

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.440 
bit more on this epic masterpiece but
anyway<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.319> like<00:02:32.470> kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.459> like<00:02:33.640> basically

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
anyway it's like kind of like basically

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.589 
anyway it's like kind of like basically
how<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.900> did<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.260> was<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:36.519> can<00:02:37.060> turn<00:02:37.330> and

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
how they did it was this can turn and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.110 
how they did it was this can turn and
that's<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.290> doesn't<00:02:38.500> really<00:02:38.890> move<00:02:39.849> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that's it it doesn't really move that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300 
that's it it doesn't really move that
much<00:02:40.360> except<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.080> fart<00:02:41.409> his<00:02:41.769> arms<00:02:42.099> can't

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
much except for that fart his arms can't

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.890 
much except for that fart his arms can't
really<00:02:42.580> come<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:42.819> because<00:02:43.269> I'm<00:02:43.569> guessing

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
really come down because I'm guessing

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.380 
really come down because I'm guessing
he's<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.230> swole<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.760> arms<00:02:46.120> are

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
he's so swole there but the arms are

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.470 
he's so swole there but the arms are
like<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.170> position<00:02:47.440> they<00:02:47.860> don't<00:02:48.040> move

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
like in that position they don't move

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.449 
like in that position they don't move
these<00:02:49.480> been<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.079> little<00:02:50.530> bit<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.190> really

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
these been a little bit it's a really

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.039 
these been a little bit it's a really
stiff<00:02:51.790> figure<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> kind<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.870> it's

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
stiff figure I kind of like that it's

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.860 
stiff figure I kind of like that it's
good<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.200> posing<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.819> fist<00:02:55.120> move<00:02:55.420> they

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
good for posing and the fist move they

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.110 
good for posing and the fist move they
