00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
time is that it is that it what you got

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.070 
time is that it is that it what you got
oh<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.150> wheels<00:03:11.330> are<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.540> need<00:03:11.690> normally

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
oh so the wheels are you need normally

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.000 
oh so the wheels are you need normally
change<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.470> oh<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.730> ok<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.890> forget<00:03:15.890> it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
change it oh but ok all right forget it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.760 
change it oh but ok all right forget it
then<00:03:16.280> let's<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:17.120> stick<00:03:17.630> with<00:03:17.690> forces<00:03:18.590> stick

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
then let's just stick with forces stick

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.620 
then let's just stick with forces stick
with<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.160> rims<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.060> guess<00:03:20.270> that's<00:03:20.480> what

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
with these rims I guess that's what

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.250 
with these rims I guess that's what
makes<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.959> back<00:03:21.110> unique<00:03:21.470> finally<00:03:22.160> understand

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
makes the back unique finally understand

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.740 
makes the back unique finally understand
alright<00:03:24.760> let's<00:03:25.760> give<00:03:25.970> this<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.239> real<00:03:26.420> quick
