notice<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.610> board<00:01:39.850> spins<00:01:40.210> around<00:01:40.360> in

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
notice that the board spins around in

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.690 
notice that the board spins around in
the<00:01:40.750> direction<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.200> quick<00:01:41.409> rotation<00:01:41.950> once

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the direction the quick rotation once

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.340 
the direction the quick rotation once
again<00:01:42.880> it's<00:01:43.210> lift<00:01:43.420> up<00:01:43.600> quickly<00:01:43.869> for<00:01:44.110> an<00:01:44.200> ollie

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
again it's lift up quickly for an ollie

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.200 
again it's lift up quickly for an ollie
then<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.830> quick<00:01:45.190> rotation<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.970> board

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
then a quick rotation of the board

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.660 
then a quick rotation of the board
either<00:01:46.390> clockwise<00:01:46.659> or<00:01:46.900> counterclockwise<00:01:47.670> now

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
either clockwise or counterclockwise now

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.200 
either clockwise or counterclockwise now
it's<00:01:48.909> time<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.240> get<00:01:49.360> into<00:01:49.510> manual

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's time to get into manual

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.270 
it's time to get into manual
with<00:01:50.690> all<00:01:50.900> these<00:01:51.080> it's<00:01:51.409> all<00:01:51.590> about<00:01:51.799> popping<00:01:52.220> up

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
with all these it's all about popping up

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.070 
with all these it's all about popping up
the<00:01:52.369> front<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.700> board<00:01:52.909> manuals<00:01:53.810> it's

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the front of the board manuals it's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.330 
the front of the board manuals it's
still<00:01:54.320> about<00:01:54.500> lifting<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.979> front<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.250> the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
still about lifting the front of the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.800 
still about lifting the front of the
board<00:01:55.580> but<00:01:55.760> now<00:01:55.970> we<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.540> do<00:01:56.690> it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
board but now we want you to do it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.080 
board but now we want you to do it
slower<00:01:57.200> by<00:01:57.830> slowly<00:01:58.190> raising<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.790> front<00:01:59.000> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
slower by slowly raising the front of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.010 
slower by slowly raising the front of
the<00:01:59.150> board<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.479> will<00:01:59.570> see<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the board you will see that the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.570 
the board you will see that the
skateboard<00:02:00.440> doesn't<00:02:00.860> pop<00:02:01.040> into<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.340> air

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
skateboard doesn't pop into the air

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.270 
skateboard doesn't pop into the air
instead<00:02:02.510> we<00:02:02.659> are<00:02:02.690> initiating<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.500> manual<00:02:04.040> or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
instead we are initiating a manual or

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.240 
instead we are initiating a manual or
what<00:02:04.460> some<00:02:04.729> people<00:02:05.000> would<00:02:05.060> call<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.570> wheelie

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
what some people would call a wheelie

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.469 
what some people would call a wheelie
now<00:02:07.250> we're<00:02:07.490> vert<00:02:07.670> skating<00:02:08.000> you'll<00:02:08.270> want<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
now we're vert skating you'll want to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.090 
now we're vert skating you'll want to
turn<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> board<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.350> parallel<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.069> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
raise the nose of the board and then

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.740 
raise the nose of the board and then
drop<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> down<00:02:25.040> getting<00:02:25.880> height<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:26.300> vert<00:02:26.540> is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
drop it down getting height then vert is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.050 
drop it down getting height then vert is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
coming off the top of the ramp try

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.060 
coming off the top of the ramp try
tilting<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.140> board<00:02:39.380> right<00:02:39.650> before<00:02:39.980> the

coping to get the spin if you tilt it in
the<00:02:45.709> air<00:02:45.860> you'll<00:02:46.100> do<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> flip<00:02:46.550> trick<00:02:46.790> instead

the air you'll do a flip trick instead

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.600 
the air you'll do a flip trick instead
the<00:02:47.720> more<00:02:47.930> severe<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.410> tilt<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.010> more<00:02:49.220> spins

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the more severe the tilt the more spins

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.940 
the more severe the tilt the more spins
you'll<00:02:49.819> get<00:02:50.030> 304<00:02:51.019> sensors<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.590> board<00:02:51.800> will

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
you'll get 304 sensors on the board will

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
you'll get 304 sensors on the board will
allow<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.310> make<00:02:52.550> grabs<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.750> sensor<00:02:54.110> on

allow you to make grabs the sensor on

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.660 
allow you to make grabs the sensor on
your<00:02:54.380> heel<00:02:54.620> edge<00:02:54.650> will<00:02:55.070> be<00:02:55.160> disabled
