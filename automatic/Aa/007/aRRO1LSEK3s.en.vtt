what Lee's from he's not from a very
goodly<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.660> there's<00:03:24.810> not<00:03:24.930> much<00:03:25.049> chance<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.290> him

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
goodly so there's not much chance of him

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.050 
goodly so there's not much chance of him
standing<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:25.799> go<00:03:25.950> off<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> make<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> sign

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
standing but we go off and make a sign

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
standing but we go off and make a sign
here<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.390> pick<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.750> second<00:03:28.170> strike<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.410> it's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
here we pick up a second strike and it's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.849 
here we pick up a second strike and it's
going<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.090> Lewandowski<00:03:30.090> um<00:03:30.359> not<00:03:31.140> sure<00:03:31.200> it

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
going to be Lewandowski um not sure it

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.500 
going to be Lewandowski um not sure it
was<00:03:32.100> such<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> great<00:03:32.549> idea<00:03:32.730> again<00:03:33.150> because<00:03:33.390> he's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
was such a great idea again because he's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.330 
was such a great idea again because he's
very<00:03:33.810> similar<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.260> an<00:03:34.470> outage<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:34.980> terms<00:03:35.190> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
very similar to an outage in terms of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.660 
very similar to an outage in terms of
their<00:03:35.579> quite<00:03:35.880> tall<00:03:36.540> strong<00:03:37.049> players<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.040> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
their quite tall strong players and that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.830 
their quite tall strong players and that
they've<00:03:38.880> got<00:03:38.970> decent<00:03:39.180> place<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.720> mainly

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
they've got decent place but it's mainly

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800 
they've got decent place but it's mainly
about<00:03:39.959> their<00:03:40.260> finishing<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.880> was<00:03:42.600> looking

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
about their finishing but I was looking

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.240 
about their finishing but I was looking
at<00:03:42.870> some<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.170> players<00:03:43.290> looking<00:03:43.620> at<00:03:43.739> s<00:03:43.950> fine

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
at some of the players looking at s fine

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.789 
at some of the players looking at s fine
and<00:03:44.670> Juve<00:03:45.480> who<00:03:45.660> are<00:03:45.780> very<00:03:46.019> very<00:03:46.170> Pacey<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
and Juve who are very very Pacey in the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.670 
and Juve who are very very Pacey in the
league<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.510> only<00:03:49.260> seemed<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.590> be

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
league and they just only seemed to be

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.840 
league and they just only seemed to be
about<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.010> pace<00:03:50.160> they<00:03:50.370> don't<00:03:50.519> really<00:03:50.700> have

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
about the pace they don't really have

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.090 
about the pace they don't really have
very<00:03:50.880> good<00:03:51.239> finishing<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.230> decided<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.920> go

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
very good finishing so I decided to go

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.949 
very good finishing so I decided to go
with<00:03:53.220> these<00:03:53.700> two<00:03:53.880> up<00:03:53.970> top<00:03:54.120> which<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.840> know

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
with these two up top which you know

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.630 
with these two up top which you know
we'll<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.739> how<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.859> goes<00:03:56.010> hopefully<00:03:56.370> it'll<00:03:56.579> be

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
we'll see how it goes hopefully it'll be

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.309 
we'll see how it goes hopefully it'll be
a<00:03:56.670> good<00:03:56.790> partnership<00:03:57.180> only<00:03:57.720> not<00:03:58.079> having<00:03:58.290> that

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
a good partnership only not having that

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.199 
a good partnership only not having that
much<00:03:58.590> worse<00:03:58.799> stats<00:03:59.100> than<00:03:59.280> Lewandowski<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.090> is

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
much worse stats than Lewandowski but is

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.270 
much worse stats than Lewandowski but is
like<00:04:00.470> seven<00:04:01.470> rated<00:04:01.769> lower<00:04:01.920> than<00:04:02.100> him<00:04:02.190> or

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
like seven rated lower than him or

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.620 
like seven rated lower than him or

something like that which is kind of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.059 
something like that which is kind of
crazy<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:04.079> we're<00:04:04.200> going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.380> go<00:04:04.440> into<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.859> game
