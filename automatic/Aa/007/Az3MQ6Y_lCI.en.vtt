from<00:04:40.990> now<00:04:42.720> there's<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.780> lot<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.320> it'd<00:04:44.470> be

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
from now there's a lot of it it'd be

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.380 
from now there's a lot of it it'd be
little<00:04:45.040> annoying<00:04:45.280> building<00:04:45.900> um<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:48.390> building

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
little annoying building um on building

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.750 
little annoying building um on building
around<00:04:49.900> them<00:04:50.110> but<00:04:50.260> it's<00:04:50.410> like<00:04:50.590> one<00:04:50.860> hit<00:04:51.070> and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
around them but it's like one hit and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.820 
around them but it's like one hit and
they're<00:04:51.940> destroyed<00:04:52.330> so<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.290> farming<00:04:53.770> is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
they're destroyed so on farming is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.410 
they're destroyed so on farming is
probably<00:04:54.190> going<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.400> be<00:04:54.460> easier<00:04:54.940> now<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.300> this

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
probably going to be easier now in this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.050 
probably going to be easier now in this
