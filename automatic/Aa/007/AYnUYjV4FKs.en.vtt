00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
good chance of finding the end zone I

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.020 
good chance of finding the end zone I
think<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> giants<00:03:06.409> are<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.220> think

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
think the giants are going to I think

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.099 
think the giants are going to I think
they're<00:03:08.150> going<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.299> handle<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.870> game<00:03:09.079> I

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
they're going to handle that game I

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.210 
they're going to handle that game I
think<00:03:09.260> they're<00:03:09.530> going<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.709> handle<00:03:10.129> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
think they're going to handle the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.250 
think they're going to handle the
Redskins<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.030> probably<00:03:11.450> be<00:03:11.659> running<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:12.049> lot

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
Redskins and probably be running a lot

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.080 
Redskins and probably be running a lot
in<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.440> fourth<00:03:12.709> quarter<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.280> again<00:03:13.849> I<00:03:13.879> think

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
in the fourth quarter and again I think

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.729 
in the fourth quarter and again I think
Jacobs<00:03:14.569> has<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> good<00:03:14.930> chance<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.319> finding<00:03:15.650> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
Jacobs has a good chance of finding the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.650 
Jacobs has a good chance of finding the
end<00:03:15.889> zone<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:16.519> use<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.790> safer<00:03:17.180> play<00:03:17.389> for

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
end zone I think use the safer play for

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.659 
end zone I think use the safer play for
eight<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.959> ten<00:03:18.139> points<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.680> sweet<00:03:18.919> got<00:03:19.370> agree

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
eight to ten points of sweet got agree

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.339
