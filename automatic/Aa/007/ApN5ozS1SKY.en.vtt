we're<00:00:00.420> talking<00:00:00.780> about<00:00:00.870> how<00:00:01.110> ERT<00:00:01.469> would

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
we're talking about how ERT would

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.500 
we're talking about how ERT would
specifically<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.580> beneficial<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.149> tennis

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
specifically be beneficial to tennis

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.470 
specifically be beneficial to tennis
elbow<00:00:04.609> so<00:00:05.609> first<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.940> ought<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.060> understand

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
elbow so first we ought to understand

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.220 
elbow so first we ought to understand
what's<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.740> tennis<00:00:07.980> elbow

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
what's going on with tennis elbow

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.169 
what's going on with tennis elbow
generally<00:00:10.230> tennis<00:00:10.500> elbow<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.309> terror<00:00:11.730> it's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
generally tennis elbow is a terror it's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.289 
generally tennis elbow is a terror it's
a<00:00:12.300> tear<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.769> usually<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> tendon<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
a tear of usually the tendon or the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.570 
a tear of usually the tendon or the
muscle<00:00:15.660> tendon<00:00:16.020> Junction<00:00:16.529> as<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:17.310> attaches

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
muscle tendon Junction as it attaches

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.820 
muscle tendon Junction as it attaches
into<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> lateral<00:00:18.449> elbow<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:19.380> course<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> can

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
into the lateral elbow of course it can

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.320 
into the lateral elbow of course it can
happen<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> medial<00:00:20.609> side<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:20.970> well<00:00:21.150> or

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
happen on the medial side as well or

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.480 
happen on the medial side as well or
even<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> tricep<00:00:22.109> tendon<00:00:22.439> usually<00:00:23.369> we're

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
even to the tricep tendon usually we're

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.269 
even to the tricep tendon usually we're
talking<00:00:23.760> about<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.539> guy<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> if

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
talking about this guy right here so if

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.910 
talking about this guy right here so if
we<00:00:26.340> zoom<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> arm<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> let<00:00:28.830> me

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we zoom up here on the arm and let me

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.339 
we zoom up here on the arm and let me
get<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.519> fingers<00:00:29.929> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:30.960> see

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
get you with your fingers you can see

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.729 
get you with your fingers you can see
the<00:00:31.769> course<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> anatomy<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.090> muscles

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
the course of the anatomy the muscles

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
the course of the anatomy the muscles
continue<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> arm<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.940> way<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
continue down the arm all the way in to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.819 
continue down the arm all the way in to
the<00:00:36.630> fingers<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.110> give<00:00:37.290> me<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:37.530> motion

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the fingers really give me some motion

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.880 
the fingers really give me some motion
there<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.270> those<00:00:39.660> guys<00:00:39.930> go

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
there and you can see those guys go

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.510 
there and you can see those guys go
ahead<00:00:40.980> relax

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.920 

the<00:00:44.520> problem<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.059> tennis<00:00:45.329> elbow<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the problem with tennis elbow is not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410 
the problem with tennis elbow is not
just<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> tearing<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.000> problem

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just the tearing here the problem

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
just the tearing here the problem
actually<00:00:48.570> goes<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.530> further<00:00:49.739> than

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
actually goes back a little further than

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000 
actually goes back a little further than
that<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.940> usually<00:00:51.390> occurs<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.649> muscle

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that it usually occurs in the muscle

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.630 
that it usually occurs in the muscle
first<00:00:54.050> through<00:00:55.050> years<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> wear<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.829> tear<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
first through years of wear and tear the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
first through years of wear and tear the
muscles<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.660> develop<00:00:58.109> fibrous<00:00:58.980> adhesion

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
muscles can develop fibrous adhesion

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.779 
muscles can develop fibrous adhesion
micro<00:01:00.270> tearing<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.140> leads<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:02.100> scar<00:01:02.520> tissue

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
micro tearing that leads to scar tissue

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.240 
micro tearing that leads to scar tissue
then<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> result<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> muscle<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> should

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then that result is a muscle that should

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.300 
then that result is a muscle that should
be<00:01:05.400> elastic<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> rubber<00:01:06.689> band<00:01:07.189> ends<00:01:08.189> up

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
be elastic like a rubber band ends up

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.140 
be elastic like a rubber band ends up
becoming<00:01:08.670> tough<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> leathery<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.250> imagine

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
becoming tough and leathery so imagine

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
becoming tough and leathery so imagine
this<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> piece<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.710> leather<00:01:13.920> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this if you have a piece of leather or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
this if you have a piece of leather or
sari<00:01:15.150> we'll<00:01:15.330> start<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> piece<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> rubber

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
sari we'll start the piece of rubber

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
sari we'll start the piece of rubber
going<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.549> here

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
going from here to here

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
going from here to here
every<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.049> strike<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.590> ball<00:01:19.740> there's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
every time you strike the ball there's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
every time you strike the ball there's
going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.880> nice<00:01:21.119> elastic<00:01:21.479> give<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
going to be a nice elastic give at the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
going to be a nice elastic give at the
attachment<00:01:22.979> point<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.549> rather<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> had

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
attachment point here rather if you had

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
attachment point here rather if you had
tissue<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> became<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.070> leathery<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
tissue that became more leathery and you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
tissue that became more leathery and you
had<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> piece<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> leather<00:01:28.439> strap<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
had a piece of leather strap from here

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.109 
had a piece of leather strap from here
to<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.340> every<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> strike<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> ball

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to here every time you strike the ball

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.100 
to here every time you strike the ball
you're<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:30.780> sudden

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you're going to get a more sudden

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
you're going to get a more sudden
tugging<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.520> classic<00:01:32.880> example<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.450> mean

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
tugging so the classic example I mean

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
tugging so the classic example I mean
it's<00:01:33.810> kind<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> easy<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> visualize<00:01:34.939> if<00:01:35.939> we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's kind of easy to visualize if we

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's kind of easy to visualize if we
just<00:01:36.390> take<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> belt

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
just take a belt

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
just take a belt
you've<00:01:37.650> got<00:01:37.829> sudden<00:01:38.400> tugging<00:01:38.759> verses<00:01:39.119> on

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you've got sudden tugging verses on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
you've got sudden tugging verses on
elastic<00:01:39.630> giving<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.740> how<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.009> end<00:01:41.369> up

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
elastic giving and that's how we end up

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
elastic giving and that's how we end up
with<00:01:41.850> tennis<00:01:42.210> elbow<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.960> many<00:01:43.229> cases<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:46.220> what

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with tennis elbow in many cases so what

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.490 
with tennis elbow in many cases so what
a<00:01:47.250> RT<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> break<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
a RT can do is we can go in break up the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
a RT can do is we can go in break up the
scar<00:01:49.710> tissue<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:52.340> restore<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:54.210> elasticity

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
scar tissue and restore more elasticity

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
do is get the muscle moving one way and

the scar tissue moving the other so I'm

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.170 
the scar tissue moving the other so I'm
going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.280> flex<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.730> wrist<00:02:36.880> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
going to have you flex the wrist and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.660 
going to have you flex the wrist and
flex<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.570> fingers<00:02:37.960> while<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.920> trap<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> scar

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
flex the fingers while I trap the scar

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.720 
flex the fingers while I trap the scar
tissue<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.960> you<00:02:41.110> go<00:02:41.230> ahead<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.560> do<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.860> we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
tissue and you go ahead and do that we

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.150 
tissue and you go ahead and do that we
apply<00:02:42.970> some<00:02:43.030> tension<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:44.500> opposite<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
apply some tension up opposite the

apply some tension up opposite the
direction<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.730> muscle<00:02:46.060> movement<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.690> we

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
direction of the muscle movement and we

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680 
direction of the muscle movement and we
can<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:47.740> scar<00:02:47.980> tissue<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> break<00:02:48.640> loose<00:02:48.940> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
can get scar tissue to break loose so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.260 
can get scar tissue to break loose so
