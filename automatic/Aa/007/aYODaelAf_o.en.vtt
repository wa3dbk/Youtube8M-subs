 today pack tips for more day or day 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.410
 snowshoe tours my recommendation 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.949
 backpack with about 45 liters 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.180
 next to you or snowshoe equipment 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.850
 you should open one when you leave 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.879
 functional gymnastics a functional 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 shirt to very important the lvs device on 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.930
 body wear 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.510
 Finally, a frame of the jacket 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.840
 or vest as well as a cap and light 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.840
 gloves 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.069
 to the avalanche burial finder 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.380
 of course, but also belong to years 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:17.740
 for some , storm is suitable 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.319
 hair shitting at the factory freezing costs 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 unnecessarily energy- functional 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.859
 Change of linen is therefore essential 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.229
 also so much to change one needed 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.569
 water and windproof though 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.170
 Breathable jacket protects in wind and 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.780
 snow 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.299
 this includes a change cap or 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
 headband and thick gloves ins 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.640
 Luggage uv rays are through the height 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.610
 and the reflecting snow very much 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.679
 aggressive to sunburn or 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.509
 you have to avoid sun-kissing 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.119
 to have 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.000
 sunscreen with sun protection factor 50 am 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.399
 best combined with a lip balm 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.670
 a sport sunglasses in the ideal case with 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.890
 change or ignite yourself and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.269
 Sun protection for the head straight in the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.109
 height, the body loses a lot 

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.479
 liquid 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.389
 a liter third in the bottle or in 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.329
 the bladder is best enriched with 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:16.180
 magnesium and electrolytes must therefore 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:19.359
 With money is necessarily one too 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.060
 thermos with tea are probably also on 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.790
 the energy supply you have to think otherwise 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 hunger lurks in between 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.630
 currently there are on the cabins 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.970
 I recommend a first aid kit 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.110
 blister plaster and personal 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.390
 medications and a painkiller 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.620
 papers ec card and cash should you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.900
 to pack in a bag 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.240
 it protects against moisture and everything is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.700
 compact together the money card ranges 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 there are usually only cash 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.100
 also accept for sanitary items 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 I recommend a bag of 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 detergent should be small and light 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.350
 in addition to the usual content on 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.030
 handkerchiefs and earplugs think for 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.490
 Overnight stays you need a hard one 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.209
 impact things he's hygienic 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.209
 founding duty 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.030
 there is still room in the backpack 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.910
 pity ski skis for ski touring 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.580

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.860
 tool repair kit and a box brotzeit 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.780

 breakfast a sandwich to buy 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.180
 if you are traveling without a work 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.150
 should not be missing 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 snow card a map and tour guide 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.510

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.220

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.650

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.020
 wrap up wax 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.310

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.440
 can also be loaded in the evening 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.060
 Growing up on snowshoe tours 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.040
 protect gaiters from snow of 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.930
