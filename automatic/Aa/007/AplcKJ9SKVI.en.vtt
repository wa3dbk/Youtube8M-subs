00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.170
 our history of 50 years I put the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.980
 face 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.410

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.720
 I couldn't do anything else other than do the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.640

 saw the mother the grandmother knead the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.320
 pasta and I can't imagine how 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.320
 it can be done with machines indeed 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.770
 we begin this visit of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 establishment we are in the area 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.539
 receipt of raw materials all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 raw material that enters is tasted 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.189
 from the organoleptic point of view when 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.770
 you eat one would play at radicchio 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.200
 ate this live.it I'm not alone 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.460
 powders have hit me a lot 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 raw material 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 the selection of products understands that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 they are in first quality having the absence 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.420
 type and even more then me 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.180
 I have also tasted a lot there is not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.800

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 you are a good of what matters is 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.640

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.680
 of white flour also I expected that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.970
 were it all starts from dancing sea ​​of 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.710
 use less fresh raw materials 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.570
 there is this machine here that does nothing else 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.570
 that split the form and the two 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.250
 ingredients end up in this 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 kneading 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.080
 and this is the pasta that is used 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.709
 check how it is done with yes 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.989

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.810

 these are the origins so I have 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.610
 Signor Giovanni started 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.530
 simply with flour and eggs 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.599
