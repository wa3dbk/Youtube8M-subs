00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
yesterday put new wiring harness on and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.690 
yesterday put new wiring harness on and
all<00:00:13.150> that<00:00:13.180> yada<00:00:13.570> yada<00:00:13.840> and<00:00:13.960> I<00:00:14.530> had<00:00:14.740> no<00:00:14.980> spark<00:00:15.490> to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
all that yada yada and I had no spark to

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.120 
all that yada yada and I had no spark to
try<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.029> set<00:00:16.209> this<00:00:16.390> timing<00:00:16.840> so<00:00:17.560> what<00:00:17.890> I<00:00:17.920> wanted

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
try and set this timing so what I wanted

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.279 
try and set this timing so what I wanted
to<00:00:18.220> go<00:00:18.340> over<00:00:18.400> with<00:00:18.580> you<00:00:18.820> today<00:00:18.849> is<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.869> quick<00:00:20.079> way

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
to go over with you today is a quick way

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.089 
to go over with you today is a quick way
to<00:00:20.320> diagnose<00:00:20.919> your<00:00:21.369> coil<00:00:21.730> switch<00:00:22.240> box<00:00:22.509> and

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
to diagnose your coil switch box and

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.279 
to diagnose your coil switch box and
distributor<00:00:24.099> trigger<00:00:24.659> trigger<00:00:25.659> is<00:00:25.869> mounted

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
distributor trigger trigger is mounted

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.059 
distributor trigger trigger is mounted
inside<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.739> distributor<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.679> it<00:00:29.679> seems<00:00:29.890> to

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:30.069 
inside the distributor and it seems to

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:31.679 
inside the distributor and it seems to
me<00:00:30.220> that<00:00:30.249> that<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.730> my<00:00:30.880> suspect<00:00:31.419> at<00:00:31.569> this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
me that that is my suspect at this

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.810 
me that that is my suspect at this
moment<00:00:31.960> according<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.770> test<00:00:33.010> this<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.790> a

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
moment according to the test this is a

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.959 
moment according to the test this is a
simple<00:00:34.300> test<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:35.160> basically<00:00:36.160> rule<00:00:36.399> out<00:00:36.670> the

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
simple test to basically rule out the

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.509 
simple test to basically rule out the
coil<00:00:37.300> in<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:38.350> switch<00:00:38.590> box<00:00:38.829> to<00:00:39.100> make<00:00:39.219> sure<00:00:39.370> that

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
coil in the switch box to make sure that

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.619 
coil in the switch box to make sure that
they're<00:00:39.730> okay<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:42.519> look<00:00:42.730> inside<00:00:43.179> here<00:00:43.239> and

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
they're okay if you look inside here and

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.490 
they're okay if you look inside here and
it's<00:00:43.780> kind<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.989> hard<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.230> see<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:46.059> there<00:00:46.899> I<00:00:47.140> have

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
it's kind of hard to see in there I have

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.110 
it's kind of hard to see in there I have
a<00:00:47.800> little<00:00:48.039> looks<00:00:48.519> like<00:00:48.670> kind<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.879> like<00:00:48.969> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
a little looks like kind of like the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.240 
a little looks like kind of like the
back<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.480> switch<00:00:49.660> box<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:50.140> blown<00:00:50.379> out<00:00:50.559> and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
back of the switch box is blown out and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.110 
back of the switch box is blown out and
these<00:00:51.370> wires<00:00:51.609> are<00:00:51.879> pretty<00:00:52.089> corroded<00:00:52.329> here<00:00:52.899> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
these wires are pretty corroded here so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.459 
these wires are pretty corroded here so

directly out it's a little snug takes a

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.970 
directly out it's a little snug takes a
little<00:01:24.190> bit<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.460> umph<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.380> unspin

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
little bit of umph and then you unspin

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.720 
little bit of umph and then you unspin
the<00:01:27.880> coil<00:01:28.270> wire<00:01:29.130> unthread<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.300> cap

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
the coil wire unthread it from the cap

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.920 
the coil wire unthread it from the cap
the<00:01:33.730> next<00:01:34.090> thing<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.480> do<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:34.750> put

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
the next thing that you do is you put

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.680 
the next thing that you do is you put
the<00:01:35.020> coil<00:01:35.230> wire<00:01:35.470> back<00:01:36.070> into<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.490> coil<00:01:36.880> on<00:01:37.630> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
the coil wire back into the coil on the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.380 
the coil wire back into the coil on the
coil<00:01:38.050> side<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.920> then<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.550> place<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.120> wire

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
coil side and then you place this wire

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.990 
coil side and then you place this wire
to<00:01:40.660> where<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.900> have<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.110> gap<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:42.610> something

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
to where you have a gap for something

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.670 
to where you have a gap for something
four-engine<00:01:43.600> ground<00:01:43.840> because<00:01:44.380> what<00:01:44.530> we're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
four-engine ground because what we're

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.090 
four-engine ground because what we're
going<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.890> do<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.160> create<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.490> spark<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
going to do is create a spark so you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.990 
going to do is create a spark so you
place<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.850> have<00:01:48.970> a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
place this so that you have a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760 
place this so that you have a
decent-sized<00:01:49.600> gap<00:01:49.870> there<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.350> it's<00:01:50.650> not

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
decent-sized gap there and it's not

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.280 
decent-sized gap there and it's not
touching<00:01:51.190> anything<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.870> next<00:01:53.110> thing<00:01:53.260> that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
touching anything the next thing that

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.350 
touching anything the next thing that
you<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.650> is<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:53.830> disconnect<00:01:54.460> all<00:01:55.120> your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
you do is you disconnect all your

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.190 
you do is you disconnect all your
distributor<00:01:55.870> wires<00:01:56.160> right<00:01:57.160> here<00:01:57.460> okay<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
distributor wires right here okay so you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.160 
distributor wires right here okay so you
take<00:01:59.380> all<00:01:59.560> these<00:01:59.710> off<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.250> then<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.580> jumper

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
take all these off and then you jumper

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.620 
take all these off and then you jumper
the<00:02:02.170> white<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:03.370> brown<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:04.030> one<00:02:04.270> jumper

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the white and the brown with one jumper

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.500 
the white and the brown with one jumper
wire<00:02:04.780> like<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.230> here<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:07.000> next<00:02:07.330> thing

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
wire like I have here the next thing

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.260 
wire like I have here the next thing
that<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.840> do

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that you do

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.480 
that you do
is<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:10.260> like<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> place<00:02:10.770> an<00:02:10.950> alligator<00:02:11.310> clip

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
is I like to place an alligator clip

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.610 
is I like to place an alligator clip
here<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.140> multiple<00:02:13.290> different

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
here you can do this multiple different

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
here you can do this multiple different
ways<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.090> essentially<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.210> you're<00:02:15.360> going

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
ways but essentially what you're going

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.170 
ways but essentially what you're going
to<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.810> ground<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.350> out<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.850> test

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to do is ground this out for this test

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420 
to do is ground this out for this test
so<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> use<00:02:19.500> an<00:02:19.650> alligator<00:02:20.010> clip<00:02:20.190> that

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
so I like to use an alligator clip that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.120 
so I like to use an alligator clip that
I<00:02:20.490> can<00:02:20.730> touch<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.570> ground<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.710> all<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> good

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I can touch on ground and all that good

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.830 
I can touch on ground and all that good
stuff

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
stuff

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.530 
stuff
wire<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:26.220> battery<00:02:26.580> hook<00:02:27.120> your<00:02:27.300> battery

wire up your battery hook your battery

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.790 
wire up your battery hook your battery
up<00:02:27.690> put<00:02:28.350> your<00:02:28.530> key<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:30.170> come<00:02:31.170> over<00:02:31.470> here

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
up put your key in on on come over here

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.310 
up put your key in on on come over here
and<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.370> want<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.640> test<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.270> 12<00:02:33.720> volts<00:02:34.080> or

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
and you want to test for 12 volts or

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.480 
and you want to test for 12 volts or
more<00:02:34.740> there<00:02:35.660> 12<00:02:36.660> volts<00:02:36.990> or<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:38.130> so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
more there 12 volts or more there so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.400 
more there 12 volts or more there so
when<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> key<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.900> you're<00:02:40.170> supposed<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
when the key is on on you're supposed to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.900 
when the key is on on you're supposed to
have<00:02:40.530> 12<00:02:40.770> volts<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.100> both<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.310> these<00:02:41.580> terminals

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
have 12 volts at both of these terminals

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.290 
have 12 volts at both of these terminals
alright<00:02:42.650> once<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:45.150> going

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
alright once you have that you're going

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.080 
alright once you have that you're going
to<00:02:45.420> temporarily<00:02:45.990> ground<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:47.250> black<00:02:47.730> wire<00:02:48.060> on

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to temporarily ground this black wire on

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.600 
to temporarily ground this black wire on
the<00:02:48.420> distributor<00:02:48.780> side<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.310> here

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the distributor side so I have it here

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
the distributor side so I have it here
I'm<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.480> use<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:52.290> ground<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
I'm going to use this as my ground and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:03.330 
I'm going to use this as my ground and
you<00:02:53.670> watch<00:02:53.910> there

supposed<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> watch<00:03:04.360> there<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.290> it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
supposed to watch there probably have it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.390 
supposed to watch there probably have it
touching

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:24.410 

get<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.420> touching

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.770

all right so I guess you should I ended
up<00:04:01.060> testing<00:04:01.360> this<00:04:01.660> all<00:04:01.900> out<00:04:02.880> let<00:04:03.880> me<00:04:03.910> finish<00:04:04.209> my

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
up testing this all out let me finish my

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.890 
up testing this all out let me finish my
statement<00:04:04.840> here<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.740> kind<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.900> my

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
statement here because I kind of my

statement here because I kind of my
grounded<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.410> process<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.069> last<00:04:09.220> video

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
grounded out process in the last video

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.940 
grounded out process in the last video
didn't<00:04:09.819> work<00:04:10.319> figured<00:04:11.319> out<00:04:11.410> why<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> didn't

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
didn't work figured out why I didn't

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.150 
didn't work figured out why I didn't
have<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> good<00:04:12.310> ground<00:04:13.020> set<00:04:14.020> up<00:04:14.170> but<00:04:15.040> anyway

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
have a good ground set up but anyway

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.789 
have a good ground set up but anyway
when<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.530> coil<00:04:17.530> wire<00:04:18.150> near<00:04:19.150> ground

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
when you have this coil wire near ground

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.500 
when you have this coil wire near ground
okay<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.639> take<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.850> wire<00:04:22.210> that's

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
okay and you take that wire that's

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.790 
okay and you take that wire that's
attached<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:23.020> black<00:04:23.290> wire<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.560> you

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
attached to this black wire and you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.210 
attached to this black wire and you
ground<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.340> out<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.930> tap<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.530> lightly<00:04:26.740> on<00:04:26.980> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
ground it out just tap it lightly on the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.950 
ground it out just tap it lightly on the
ground<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.730> know<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.210> used<00:04:28.390> right<00:04:28.630> here

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
ground you know like I used right here

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.850 
ground you know like I used right here
when<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.100> touch<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.790> there<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:32.260> should

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
when you touch it to there it should

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.600 
when you touch it to there it should
spark<00:04:33.610> okay<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:35.050> should<00:04:35.290> see<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> quick<00:04:36.160> spark

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
spark okay you should see a quick spark

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.409 
spark okay you should see a quick spark
from<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.270> end<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.200> your<00:04:38.350> coil<00:04:38.650> wire<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:40.210> your

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
from the end of your coil wire to your

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.860 
from the end of your coil wire to your
ground<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:42.580> should<00:04:42.790> jump<00:04:43.030> about<00:04:43.210> 3/8<00:04:43.690> of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
ground and it should jump about 3/8 of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.770 
ground and it should jump about 3/8 of
an<00:04:43.990> inch<00:04:45.510> if<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:46.900> does<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:49.240> reassemble

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
an inch if it does and you reassemble

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.900 
an inch if it does and you reassemble
all<00:04:50.020> your<00:04:50.229> wires<00:04:50.440> here<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.040> know<00:04:51.160> black<00:04:51.490> white

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
all your wires here you know black white

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.620 
all your wires here you know black white
brown<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:54.490> hook<00:04:54.729> everything<00:04:55.030> back<00:04:55.360> up

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
brown and you hook everything back up

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.260 
brown and you hook everything back up
and<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> still<00:04:56.380> doesn't<00:04:56.590> work

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
and it still doesn't work

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.670 
and it still doesn't work
what<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.419> got<00:04:58.600> going<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.440> probably

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
what you got going on is you probably

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.750 
what you got going on is you probably
have<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.190> trigger<00:05:00.550> that's<00:05:00.820> out<00:05:01.090> okay<00:05:02.040> so<00:05:03.040> right

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
have a trigger that's out okay so right

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.930 
have a trigger that's out okay so right
now<00:05:03.940> that's<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.360> condition<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.080> I'm<00:05:05.260> at

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
now that's the condition that I'm at

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.200 
now that's the condition that I'm at
this<00:05:06.990> will<00:05:07.990> arc<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:09.460> when<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:09.790> hook<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.120> all

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
this will arc but when I hook it all

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.950 
this will arc but when I hook it all
back<00:05:10.450> up<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:12.419> what<00:05:13.419> I<00:05:13.450> was<00:05:13.690> doing

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
back up and you know what I was doing

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.960 
back up and you know what I was doing
was<00:05:14.110> leaving<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.650> where<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.100> ground<00:05:15.669> was

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
was leaving this where the ground was

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.909 
was leaving this where the ground was
and<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.270> was<00:05:16.390> manually<00:05:16.930> rotating<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.680> motor

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and I was manually rotating the motor

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.779 
and I was manually rotating the motor

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
which he should get six sparks I wasn't

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.360

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
at all rotating the motor so that tells

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.060 
at all rotating the motor so that tells
me<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.300> my<00:05:28.450> trigger<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:28.900> probably<00:05:29.590> shot<00:05:29.860> I'm

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
me that my trigger is probably shot I'm

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.730 
me that my trigger is probably shot I'm
going<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.310> confirm<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.850> today<00:05:31.590> we'll<00:05:32.590> look

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740
