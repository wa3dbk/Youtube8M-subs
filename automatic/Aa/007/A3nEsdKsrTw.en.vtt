00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.379
 2 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.359
 it is just very good at it 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359
 and if that fails then you still go home to write 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.339
 it would be about making a judgment 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 Amsterdam anp maarten 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.429
 after visiting the just in 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.660
 Iniesta also almost missed it 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 Take the ballot box, for example 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.190
 I have a very high voice 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 it wouldn't be smart 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.540
 being the experienced boy from April 16th you have no beard in your throat 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 still not 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.270
 let go 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.830
 if all goes well 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.660
 though I fear 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.900
 you must agree with the harsh winter of banks 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.890
 liestal 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 I will 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 in the phone 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.230
 it sum 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 is strange 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.390
 and then feasible 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.200
 performance 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.299
 it is and remains not 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.610
 should you see how 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.900
 I think I'll have to wait a little while until your vocal cords are in the hand of now 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.510
 very young man 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.770
 you speak with that I think the audience can be terrible 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 afterwards stroke struck though 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.870
 it is in 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.590
 but yes fishing game 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 he will take over 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.390
 third party 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.370
 in other cases 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.160
 yes the racing stable 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.180
 yes, this is precisely what the Netherlands can be controlled 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.970
 I do like it 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.260
 according to latch the highlight is 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.890
 if you can do nothing, the attention of the wolf remains 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 yes that is quite a million activities performed with four 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
 goals towards the end of a hype 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130
 Councilor 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.969
 Hey 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.560
 novum 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.229
 the cargo 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.089
 vlissingen 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.030
 with your question 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.909
 and they find that singing 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.700
 den bosch a dozen I am going to sing I mean the west of queen yes 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.739
 arctic sea is this donation time 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.470
 at the first time in my retina a small 8 seems very important that 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:35.859
 is 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.979
 a bad year 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.359
 but then never so is PVDA with a but I if you compare that not one 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.359
 stolen 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:49.819
 it all for 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 the first verse the low side and abusive words are not allowed 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.819
 as a possible restart it was actually very unfortunate because the location 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.739
 for me more about musician music was not such a good line year the best must 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 make you no longer possible 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.089
 nei exchange all thoughts 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 nei all thoughts 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:15.079
 no shame then 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.079
 neanderthals 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.549
 no, no less dare to keep water 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:25.969
