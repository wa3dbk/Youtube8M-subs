the next thing you see is the 3ds stand
she's<00:02:09.530> actually<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:10.360> lot<00:02:11.360> smaller<00:02:11.720> than<00:02:12.709> I

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
she's actually a lot smaller than I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.350 
she's actually a lot smaller than I
expected<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.519> that's<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.880> that's<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.239> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
expected and that's all that's in the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.930 
expected and that's all that's in the
box<00:02:17.110> yes<00:02:18.110> very<00:02:18.680> very<00:02:18.830> compact<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.670> thought<00:02:19.850> it'd

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
box yes very very compact I thought it'd

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.820 
box yes very very compact I thought it'd
be<00:02:19.970> bigger<00:02:21.100> but<00:02:22.100> very<00:02:22.489> nice<00:02:23.410> should<00:02:24.410> do<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> very

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
obviously unaffiliated so you might be

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.590 
obviously unaffiliated so you might be
working<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.260> both<00:04:25.500> sides<00:04:26.030> here<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.270> Dark
