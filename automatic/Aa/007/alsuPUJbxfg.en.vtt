00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
all day long but we need to right the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.740 
all day long but we need to right the
ship<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:15.030> obviously<00:00:15.389> we

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
ship at some point obviously we

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.650 
ship at some point obviously we
struggled<00:00:16.199> big<00:00:16.470> time<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.859> second<00:00:17.220> half

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
struggled big time in the second half

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.849 
struggled big time in the second half
the<00:00:18.660> answer<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> bell<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.289> offensively<00:00:19.710> with

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the answer the bell all offensively with

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.740 
the answer the bell all offensively with
two<00:00:19.980> big<00:00:20.160> scores<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.880> then<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.689> we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
two big scores and then I'm I think we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.689 
two big scores and then I'm I think we
had<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> couple<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.199> drops<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.680> 11<00:00:23.250> series

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
had a couple of drops in at 11 series

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
had a couple of drops in at 11 series
little<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.510> could<00:00:24.630> answer<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:24.990> again

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little I think we could answer it again

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
little I think we could answer it again
