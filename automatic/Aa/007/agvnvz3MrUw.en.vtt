brings<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.630> shape<00:00:27.960> back<00:00:28.290> to<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:28.950> I<00:00:28.980> shape

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
brings the shape back to the way I shape

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.940 
brings the shape back to the way I shape
it<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:30.030> put<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.360> this<00:00:30.510> glass<00:00:30.870> all<00:00:31.290> this<00:00:31.470> resin

it we put all this glass all this resin
on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.070> board<00:00:32.400> and<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.760> few<00:00:32.940> lumps

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
on the board and there's a few lumps

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.570 
on the board and there's a few lumps
bumps<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> sander<00:00:34.650> comes<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> smooth

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
bumps so the sander comes in and smooth

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.670 
bumps so the sander comes in and smooth
this<00:00:35.880> board<00:00:36.150> over<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:37.080> brings<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.530> the

done<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.450> here's<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.959> board<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:51.349> popped

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
done and here's the board it's popped

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.059 
done and here's the board it's popped
out<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.399> shaped<00:01:52.849> exactly<00:01:53.119> how<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.750> how<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.709> like

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
out it's shaped exactly how I how I like

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.279 
out it's shaped exactly how I how I like
it<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.670> got<00:01:55.940> this<00:01:56.060> concave<00:01:56.690> in<00:01:56.899> there<00:01:57.110> that's

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
it it's got this concave in there that's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.820 
it it's got this concave in there that's
like<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.500> V<00:01:57.800> concave<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:58.970> got<00:01:59.209> this<00:01:59.360> wider

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
like a V concave it's got this wider

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830 
like a V concave it's got this wider
rounded<00:02:00.830> square<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.940> little<00:02:02.420> bit<00:02:02.509> straighter

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
rounded square a little bit straighter

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
rounded square a little bit straighter
in<00:02:02.989> the<00:02:03.080> plan<00:02:03.289> shape<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.340> still<00:02:04.640> has<00:02:04.819> a<00:02:04.849> pointy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
in the plan shape it still has a pointy

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.510 
in the plan shape it still has a pointy
nice<00:02:05.479> let's<00:02:06.229> do<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> little<00:02:06.619> bit<00:02:06.800> wide<00:02:07.009> here<00:02:07.310> so

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
nice let's do a little bit wide here so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.270 
nice let's do a little bit wide here so
it's<00:02:07.670> really<00:02:07.940> easy<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.599> paddle<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.679> rail<00:02:09.950> on

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
it's really easy to paddle the rail on

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.400 
it's really easy to paddle the rail on
it<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:11.060> got<00:02:11.270> quite<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.569> bit<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.959> thick<00:02:12.170> rail

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it it's got quite a bit of a thick rail

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.740 
it it's got quite a bit of a thick rail
with<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> flutter<00:02:13.400> deck<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:13.879> still<00:02:14.090> domes<00:02:14.420> down

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
with a flutter deck but still domes down

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.630 
with a flutter deck but still domes down
a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:15.110> bit<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> shaping

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
a little bit there so that's the shaping

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.660 
a little bit there so that's the shaping
part<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.660> glasses<00:02:17.930> they<00:02:18.800> put<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.129> carbon<00:02:19.550> on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
part the glasses they put the carbon on

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220 
part the glasses they put the carbon on
the<00:02:19.700> tail<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.390> nice<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.599> strong<00:02:20.870> here

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the tail to make it nice and strong here

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110 
the tail to make it nice and strong here
because<00:02:21.560> usually<00:02:22.250> you're<00:02:22.550> riding<00:02:22.879> such<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
because usually you're riding such a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.030 
because usually you're riding such a
shorter<00:02:23.599> board<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.500> model<00:02:24.860> so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
shorter board for this this model so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.070 
shorter board for this this model so
those<00:02:25.580> bigger<00:02:25.849> guys<00:02:26.090> when<00:02:26.360> they<00:02:26.450> step<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.959> this

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
those bigger guys when they step on this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.140 
those bigger guys when they step on this
it<00:02:27.260> won't<00:02:27.410> crush<00:02:27.709> through<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> tail<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it won't crush through the tail the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
it won't crush through the tail the
logos<00:02:29.660> are<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.140> positions<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.769> I've

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
logos are in the positions that I've

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.650 
logos are in the positions that I've
asked<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> Glasser<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.879> put<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.480> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
asked the Glasser to put in like that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
asked the Glasser to put in like that
and<00:02:33.640> he<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> base<00:02:35.209> logo<00:02:35.750> which<00:02:35.930> actually

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and he but the base logo which actually

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.410 
and he but the base logo which actually
says<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.739> know<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.370> grass<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
says you know it's grass to the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.600 
says you know it's grass to the
standards<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:38.959> would<00:02:39.140> deliver<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:40.459> you've

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
standards and would deliver then you've

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
standards and would deliver then you've
got<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> guys<00:02:41.030> put<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> fins<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> angles

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
got the guys put the fins in the angles

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
got the guys put the fins in the angles
of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.800> fin<00:02:43.129> on<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.819> six<00:02:44.090> point<00:02:44.330> five

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
of the fin on this one is six point five

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.140 
of the fin on this one is six point five
degrees<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.830> make<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.160> board

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
degrees that's going to make this board

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.180 
degrees that's going to make this board
suit<00:02:47.690> for<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> whole<00:02:48.080> way<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.410> plan<00:02:48.650> shape

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
suit for the whole way the plan shape

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.980 
suit for the whole way the plan shape
that's<00:02:49.490> Australia<00:02:49.910> plan<00:02:50.120> shake<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.900> I've

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
that's Australia plan shake but I've

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's Australia plan shake but I've
opened<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.440> things<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:51.890> which<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
opened the things up which is the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.510 
opened the things up which is the
technical<00:02:53.180> way<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.290> makes<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> board<00:02:55.100> go

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
technical way that makes this board go

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.180 
technical way that makes this board go
better<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:56.000> smaller<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.840> bigger<00:02:57.050> waves<00:02:57.410> only

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
better in smaller and bigger waves only

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.460 
better in smaller and bigger waves only
a<00:02:58.400> three<00:02:58.670> fin<00:02:58.880> board<00:02:59.180> then<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.020> comes<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
a three fin board then it comes in the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.710 
a three fin board then it comes in the
sanding<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.280> look<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.850> handprint<00:03:02.390> up

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
sanding if you look it's a handprint up

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.840 
sanding if you look it's a handprint up
is<00:03:03.260> where<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.680> edge<00:03:03.830> stops<00:03:04.190> are<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:04.610> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
is where the edge stops are all that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.240 
is where the edge stops are all that
edges<00:03:05.300> they're<00:03:05.480> nice<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.960> sharp<00:03:06.320> edge<00:03:06.650> that's

edges they're nice and sharp edge that's
going<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.490> make<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.850> forward<00:03:08.150> when<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.360> do

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
going to make that forward when you do

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.840 
going to make that forward when you do
your<00:03:08.780> bottom<00:03:09.020> turn<00:03:09.230> hold<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.710> nice<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.580> soft
