not going to and then the restart there
was<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.480> dumb<00:00:52.989> clock<00:00:53.230> on<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.559> way<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:53.739> you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
was a dumb clock on the way and you

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.770 
was a dumb clock on the way and you
really<00:00:54.430> really<00:00:54.460> really<00:00:55.090> made<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.390> big<00:00:55.510> mistake

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
really really really made a big mistake

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.380 
really really really made a big mistake
and<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.559> we<00:00:56.890> were<00:00:57.010> all<00:00:57.250> trapped<00:00:57.580> you<00:00:58.210> know

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
and and we were all trapped you know

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.110 
and and we were all trapped you know
just<00:00:58.989> in<00:00:59.200> an<00:00:59.320> iwork<00:00:59.670> nose-to-tail<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:01.090> I

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
just in an iwork nose-to-tail so I

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.670 
just in an iwork nose-to-tail so I
couldn't<00:01:01.450> get<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.570> run<00:01:01.780> on<00:01:01.809> him<00:01:02.110> but<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.470> idea

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
couldn't get a run on him but the idea

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.530 
couldn't get a run on him but the idea
was<00:01:02.710> just<00:01:03.010> lagging<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.640> little<00:01:03.670> bit<00:01:03.969> behind<00:01:04.180> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
was just lagging a little bit behind and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.260 
was just lagging a little bit behind and
gotta<00:01:05.140> run<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:05.500> me<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.729> know<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> really

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
gotta run on me and you know I really

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.520 
gotta run on me and you know I really
didn't<00:01:07.450> want<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.630> get<00:01:07.780> caught<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.020> blocking

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
didn't want to get caught for blocking

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.010 
didn't want to get caught for blocking
or<00:01:08.649> anything<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.220> didn't<00:01:09.520> move<00:01:09.640> at<00:01:09.790> all<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
or anything so I didn't move at all and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.260 
or anything so I didn't move at all and
he<00:01:11.110> got<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.290> good<00:01:11.500> run<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:11.710> me<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.190> didn't<00:01:13.149> feel

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
he got a good run on me I didn't feel

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.920 
he got a good run on me I didn't feel
like<00:01:13.330> resisting<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.290> just<00:01:14.619> let<00:01:14.860> him<00:01:14.950> buy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
like resisting so I just let him buy

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.210 
like resisting so I just let him buy
from<00:01:16.930> there<00:01:17.080> on<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.530> know<00:01:17.649> I<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:17.950> kind<00:01:18.160> of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
from there on I you know I was kind of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.560 
from there on I you know I was kind of
hoping<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.670> at<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.910> end<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.240> second

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
hoping that at the end of the second

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.420 
hoping that at the end of the second
stint<00:01:19.810> there's<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.680> option<00:01:20.770> tyres<00:01:21.160> were

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
stint there's the option tyres were

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.940 
stint there's the option tyres were
gonna<00:01:21.640> fail<00:01:21.850> for<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.300> little<00:01:22.420> bit<00:01:22.800> but<00:01:23.800> it

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
gonna fail for a little bit but it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.540 
gonna fail for a little bit but it
wasn't<00:01:24.220> enough<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:27.070> know<00:01:27.190> we<00:01:27.369> just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
wasn't enough and you know we just

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.850 
wasn't enough and you know we just
walked<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> marriage<00:01:28.330> went<00:01:29.020> much<00:01:29.680> further

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
walked in the marriage went much further

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.270 
walked in the marriage went much further
than<00:01:30.009> ha1<00:01:31.000> not<00:01:31.179> further<00:01:31.390> than<00:01:31.600> Justin<00:01:32.050> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
than ha1 not further than Justin and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.740 
than ha1 not further than Justin and
that<00:01:33.280> was<00:01:33.789> good<00:01:33.940> enough<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.270> stop<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.569> pass

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that was good enough to stop the pass

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.120 
that was good enough to stop the pass
and<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:35.020> knew<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.319> thought<00:01:35.560> Sebastian's

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
and I knew I thought Sebastian's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.380 
and I knew I thought Sebastian's
probably<00:01:36.369> quicker<00:01:36.490> me<00:01:36.789> so<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.000> thought<00:01:37.179> if<00:01:37.330> I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
probably quicker me so I thought if I

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.559 
probably quicker me so I thought if I
get<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.569> get<00:01:38.259> around<00:01:38.470> him<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.729> maybe<00:01:39.970> do

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
get a get around him and and maybe do

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.089 
get a get around him and and maybe do
something<00:01:40.810> with<00:01:41.050> Justin<00:01:41.410> but<00:01:41.530> uh<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.979> know<00:01:42.009> I

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
something with Justin but uh you know I

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:43.380 
something with Justin but uh you know I
finished<00:01:42.670> where<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:42.789> share<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.000> finish<00:01:43.270> they

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
finished where I share to finish they

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510 
finished where I share to finish they
were<00:01:43.509> there<00:01:43.780> quick<00:01:43.990> under<00:01:44.170> me<00:01:44.289> but<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:45.429> know

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
were there quick under me but you know

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.100 
were there quick under me but you know
at<00:01:45.640> least<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.880> made<00:01:46.030> Sebastian<00:01:46.780> stare<00:01:46.959> at<00:01:47.020> that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
at least I made Sebastian stare at that
