that imagination I feel like parents

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.419 
that imagination I feel like parents
should<00:02:01.690> encourage<00:02:02.590> them<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.890> start<00:02:03.250> creating

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
should encourage them to start creating

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.889 
should encourage them to start creating
and<00:02:03.819> going<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.090> theatre<00:02:04.360> groups<00:02:04.569> dance

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
and going the theatre groups dance

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.139 
and going the theatre groups dance
companies<00:02:05.500> vocal<00:02:06.160> lessons<00:02:06.519> I<00:02:06.759> think<00:02:06.789> that

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
companies vocal lessons I think that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.119 
companies vocal lessons I think that
especially<00:02:08.080> when<00:02:08.470> you're<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> kid<00:02:08.769> that<00:02:08.950> feels

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
especially when you're a kid that feels

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.650 
especially when you're a kid that feels
a<00:02:09.220> little<00:02:09.340> different<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.940> know<00:02:10.030> artists<00:02:10.539> were

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
a little different you know artists were

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.220 
a little different you know artists were
a<00:02:10.690> little<00:02:10.899> bit<00:02:11.110> out<00:02:11.440> there<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:12.519> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
a little bit out there and I think that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.860 
a little bit out there and I think that
getting<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.830> outlet<00:02:15.250> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
getting to have that outlet and
