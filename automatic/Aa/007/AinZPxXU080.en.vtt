00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
We're going to present you here a game we're working on.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.983
It is Mafia II.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:11.441
What you're going to see now is the same demo we've shown

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.023
to the press in Cologne, at GamesCom convention.

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:22.113
Aaand... the imagine is somewhat squeezed in here...

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:29.389
Anyway, a little interesting thing, this presentation you're about to see

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:32.544
is the first public presentation of Mafia II.

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:37.703
Live... live play of Mafia II.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:43.531
So far we've only publicly presented videos or only to the press behind closed door

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:48.292
and what we're going to see now is Mafia's little public premiere.

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:54.668
Well... I guess there is no point in tell you any data, I guess you already know Mafia,

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:58.988
if not, you can just search it on Google, you'll find a lot of information there.

00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:04.227
Or on fansites, there for sure.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:17.264
Let's start by a little montage of what we've shown so far... to the press.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:17.366
Some various action sequences.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.226
These were some action parts we've shown on E3 and to the press.

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.445
And now you're going to see something completely different.

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:57.373
Something where the main focus is the city and some 2 action parts.

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:29.224
This is Vito Scalleta, the main character of Mafia II.

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:36.229
The guy from before is Joe Barbaro who is... his buddy.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.401
Right now Vito is in Joe's apartment.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.118
And as you can see they're having a good time.

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:49.205
So, left have a beer.

00:04:00.357 --> 00:04:04.726
Well, guess she's gonna have to wait.

00:04:37.997 --> 00:04:44.447
We just were told to drop by at Giuseppe's, it's sort of a main quest.

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:48.849
We got dressed up and we can head out.

00:04:55.984 --> 00:05:02.580
As you can see we're leaving the apartment through the corridors.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.348
Notice the texture quality, the attention to detail.

00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:13.420
I'd like to point out that what you see here we're playing on an Xbox test-kit,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.860
that means a console version that has many limitations.

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.543
So, here's our garage.

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:35.330
The game takes place in a city, you need to move a lot, therefore it's important you have cars at your disposal.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.264
We're going to pick one that we stored here before. Let's take this one.

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:45.104
And we can head out.

00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:59.144
So, what's going on over there? Our friend has some trouble.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.535
Well, Radim, come on, do something.

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:25.460
We just witnessed this little incident here. Such things liven up the city life.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.922
But as you heard, we've no time, we have a task ahead of us.

00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:42.987
The game takes place in Empire Bay,

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:49.946
it's a fictional city based on some America's cities.

00:07:49.946 --> 00:07:55.217
It takes place in the 40's and 50's.

00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:07.401
As you can see... authentic street decorations.
