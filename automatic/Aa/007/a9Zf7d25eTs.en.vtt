00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029

site here but again we downloaded at

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
site here but again we downloaded at
least<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.370> downloaded<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> SDK<00:01:03.090> through

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
least I downloaded the SDK through

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
least I downloaded the SDK through
eclipse<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> access

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
eclipse so all we have to do is access

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109 
eclipse so all we have to do is access
that<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.930> add<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.470> jar<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.100> our<00:01:08.220> project<00:01:08.700> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that and add that jar to our project so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.219 
that and add that jar to our project so
we're<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.600> click<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> new

we're gonna right click on the new

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
we're gonna right click on the new
Boston<00:01:10.680> package<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.490> whatever<00:01:11.790> package

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
this we're gonna go to Java build path

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.149 
this we're gonna go to Java build path
and<00:01:27.570> we're<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.530> project

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and we're going to go into our project

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
and we're going to go into our project
or<00:01:29.400> our<00:01:29.520> libraries<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.180> mean<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:31.079> gonna

or our libraries I mean and we're gonna

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
or our libraries I mean and we're gonna
say<00:01:31.409> add<00:01:31.619> external<00:01:32.280> jar<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:33.659> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.770 
say add external jar because again we
downloaded<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> SDK<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:35.070> has<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> jar<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
downloaded the SDK which has a jar that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
downloaded the SDK which has a jar that
we<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.409> we're<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> gonna<00:01:37.740> say<00:01:37.979> add

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.090 
we need so we're just gonna say add
external<00:01:38.610> jar<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:40.079> we're<00:01:40.170> gonna<00:01:40.290> refer<00:01:40.770> back

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
external jar and we're gonna refer back

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.030 
external jar and we're gonna refer back
to<00:01:41.430> wherever<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.970> downloaded<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> SDK<00:01:42.710> or<00:01:43.710> if

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.310 
open that there but again I download the
SDK<00:01:52.649> within<00:01:53.149> my<00:01:54.149> hard<00:01:54.360> drive<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.170> just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
SDK within my hard drive so I'm just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
SDK within my hard drive so I'm just
going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> open<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.310> find<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
going to open that up and find the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.560 
going to open that up and find the
Android<00:01:57.390> SDK<00:01:57.890> for<00:01:58.890> Mac<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.460> wherever<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.479> guys

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
Android SDK for Mac or wherever you guys
again<00:02:00.960> downloaded<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> SDK

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
again downloaded the SDK

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.139 
again downloaded the SDK
we're<00:02:02.759> gonna<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> extras<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.969> then<00:02:05.969> we're

SDK<00:02:13.530> right<00:02:13.770> here<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.250> gonna<00:02:14.340> open<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.670> up

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
SDK right here we're gonna open that up

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.640 
SDK right here we're gonna open that up
and<00:02:15.239> here's<00:02:15.599> our<00:02:15.750> jar<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.530> look

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
permission and then we're gonna go down

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.690 
permission and then we're gonna go down
we're<00:03:22.049> gonna<00:03:22.139> find<00:03:23.389> access<00:03:24.389> network<00:03:25.200> state

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
we're gonna find access network state

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.800 
we're gonna find access network state
that's<00:03:26.700> another<00:03:27.030> permission<00:03:27.510> we're<00:03:27.630> going<00:03:27.750> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
that's another permission we're going to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.080 
that's another permission we're going to
need<00:03:28.079> for<00:03:28.410> AdMob<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.549> we're<00:03:29.639> just<00:03:29.670> gonna<00:03:29.910> click

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
need for AdMob so we're just gonna click

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.699 
need for AdMob so we're just gonna click
that<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.569> save<00:03:30.989> our<00:03:31.139> project

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
that and save our project

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.699 
that and save our project
and<00:03:32.359> then<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.569> maybe<00:03:33.750> double<00:03:34.170> check<00:03:34.380> go<00:03:34.560> back

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
and then just maybe double check go back

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.400 
and then just maybe double check go back
to<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.950> XML<00:03:35.430> make<00:03:36.000> sure<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.630> new<00:03:36.930> permission

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
to the XML make sure that new permission

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
to the XML make sure that new permission
is<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:37.859> as<00:03:38.040> well<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.639> need<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is in there as well so we need the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.840 
is in there as well so we need the
access<00:03:39.540> network<00:03:39.720> state<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:41.160> internet<00:03:41.579> so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
access network state and the internet so

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
access network state and the internet so
