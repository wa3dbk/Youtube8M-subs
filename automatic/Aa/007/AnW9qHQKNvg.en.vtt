okay<00:00:00.690> continuing<00:00:01.170> on<00:00:01.319> with<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> stereo

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay continuing on with the stereo

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay continuing on with the stereo
installation<00:00:02.399> these<00:00:03.300> days<00:00:03.570> they<00:00:03.810> make<00:00:04.049> it

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
installation these days they make it

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.230 
installation these days they make it
pretty<00:00:04.710> much<00:00:04.830> idiot<00:00:05.160> proof<00:00:05.370> they<00:00:05.940> didn't<00:00:06.120> have

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
pretty much idiot proof they didn't have

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.680 
pretty much idiot proof they didn't have
these<00:00:06.330> harnesses<00:00:06.810> back<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:08.240> 95<00:00:09.240> or<00:00:09.570> so

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
these harnesses back like in 95 or so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.810 
these harnesses back like in 95 or so
well<00:00:09.870> they<00:00:10.019> did<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.380> them<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:11.010> didn't

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
well they did have them but we didn't

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.240 
well they did have them but we didn't
use<00:00:11.940> them<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> lot<00:00:12.269> let's<00:00:12.450> put<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:12.809> way<00:00:13.250> but

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
use them a lot let's put it that way but

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.680 
use them a lot let's put it that way but
now<00:00:14.370> they've<00:00:14.549> got<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.790> factory<00:00:15.240> harnesses

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
now they've got these factory harnesses

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
now they've got these factory harnesses
this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.740> what<00:00:17.190> plugs<00:00:17.400> into<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> vehicle

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this is what plugs into the vehicle

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.990 
this is what plugs into the vehicle
see<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.170> all<00:00:19.350> color-coded<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
see it's all color-coded this is the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.450 
see it's all color-coded this is the
fact<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> harness<00:00:22.380> form<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.340> new

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fact the or the harness form the the new

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
fact the or the harness form the the new
radio<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.289> easy<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> do

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
radio and it's it's really easy to do

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
radio and it's it's really easy to do
I've<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> set<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.849> strippers<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I've got a set of strippers because the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900 
I've got a set of strippers because the
radio<00:00:28.830> wires<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.279> stripped<00:00:29.730> back

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
radio wires are not stripped back

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
radio wires are not stripped back
instead<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.929> crimpers<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.660> some<00:00:33.660> connectors

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
instead of crimpers and some connectors

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
instead of crimpers and some connectors
you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.010> solder<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.340> together<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> my

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you can solder them together this is my

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
you can solder them together this is my
daughter's<00:00:36.600> car<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.850> big

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
daughter's car so this is that a big

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.180 
daughter's car so this is that a big
stereo<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.649> no<00:00:40.860> big<00:00:41.010> deal

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
stereo going in so you know no big deal

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
stereo going in so you know no big deal
first<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.739> is<00:00:44.480> take<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
first thing I like to do is take all the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.439 
first thing I like to do is take all the
wires<00:00:47.870> see<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.050> straighten<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
wires see here straighten them all out I

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
wires see here straighten them all out I
like<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> cut<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.379> length

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
like to cut them to the same length

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
like to cut them to the same length
because<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> same<00:00:54.420> length<00:00:54.719> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
because these are all the same length so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.810 
because these are all the same length so
and<00:00:55.350> long<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.370> they're<00:00:56.489> close<00:00:57.050> cut<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.170> up

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and long as they're close cut them up

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
and long as they're close cut them up
somewhere<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> ballpark<00:01:00.590> there<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.770> go

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
somewhere in the ballpark there we go

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.960 
somewhere in the ballpark there we go
and<00:01:02.809> then<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.580> literally<00:01:05.580> match

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and then all you do is literally match

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
and then all you do is literally match
color<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.540> color<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.960> forgot<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> cut<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
color for color I forgot to cut one

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.080 
color for color I forgot to cut one
there<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> easy

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there it's that easy

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
there it's that easy
so<00:01:15.500> it's<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> couple<00:01:16.920> features<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> don't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so it's got a couple features you don't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.840 
so it's got a couple features you don't
need<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.710> literally<00:01:19.710> purple<00:01:20.189> purple<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
need but literally purple purple and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.660 
need but literally purple purple and
I'll<00:01:21.600> show<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> how<00:01:22.070> do<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.189> yellow<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
I'll show you how do this yellow one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.499 
I'll show you how do this yellow one
here<00:01:23.909> tear<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:25.670> will<00:01:26.670> strip<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:29.299> group

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.350 

there<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> go

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
there you go

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.310 
there you go
just<00:01:35.930> move<00:01:36.230> around<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.620> little<00:01:36.740> bit<00:01:38.320> take

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
just move around a little bit take

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.360 
just move around a little bit take
connector<00:01:43.720> slide<00:01:44.720> one<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.320> take<00:01:46.190> our

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
connector slide one and then take our

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:55.660 
connector slide one and then take our
crimpers<00:01:52.750> cut<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.900> down<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:55.190> then<00:01:55.370> just<00:01:55.400> crimp

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
crimpers cut it down and then just crimp

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.660 
crimpers cut it down and then just crimp
down<00:01:55.730> really<00:01:56.060> nice<00:01:56.800> slide<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> other<00:01:58.100> end<00:01:58.310> in

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.620 

and<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.760> can<00:02:04.850> slide<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.120> both<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.420> same

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
and you can slide it both in the same

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.719 
and you can slide it both in the same
time<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.050> doesn't<00:02:06.290> matter<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:07.310> depends<00:02:07.670> on

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
time it doesn't matter just depends on

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.290 
time it doesn't matter just depends on
if<00:02:07.850> you're<00:02:08.000> where<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.780> crimp<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
if you're where you crimp it up if that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.080 
if you're where you crimp it up if that
down<00:02:11.860> got<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> good<00:02:13.070> solid<00:02:13.430> connection<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.060> you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
down got a good solid connection so you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.400 
down got a good solid connection so you
do<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.420> with<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.570> remaining<00:02:14.900> wires<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
do that with the remaining wires and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.199 
do that with the remaining wires and
then<00:02:15.530> before<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.950> you're<00:02:16.130> done<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.550> stay

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
then before you know you're done so stay

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.500 
then before you know you're done so stay
tuned<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.630> we'll<00:02:17.750> finish<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:19.270> okay<00:02:20.270> once

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
tuned and we'll finish this up okay once

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.250 
tuned and we'll finish this up okay once
you're<00:02:20.660> done<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.959> should<00:02:20.990> have<00:02:21.140> something

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
you're done you should have something

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.010 
you're done you should have something
that<00:02:21.680> looks<00:02:22.100> kind<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.180> that's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
that looks kind of like this that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.580 
that looks kind of like this that's
about<00:02:24.290> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
about it
