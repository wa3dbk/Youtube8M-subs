00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750

 higelin service of you voted one 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 it must be said that must be said that this 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.229
 collector is very pretty but I'm not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.479
 final fantasy fan 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.290
 and that's good for this week I 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 bought only four games so built to 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.710
 the purchase of the week is going to be okay 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 not too complicated we will start everything 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 immediately we will show the half hours to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.000
 the end I still found a new 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 time that audio co2 I do not know if it will be 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 I still do not know if it's the xana 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.119
 final destruction I still do not know 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.100
 not if this one the 1 or the 2 which is this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.960
 who went out on ds 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 I bought myself on ps1 I did not know 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.640
 not that he had released a legend of the fps 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.710
 fps was called before this style doom like 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.570
 because one of the very first one of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 pillars of this series of seven of this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 kind was double whereas it was 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 not the first was up jane 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 the prime asset and so it's quake 2 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 and two sawmills coast it's a game 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 huge that I loved playing on the n64 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.100
 I hope that at least the most manageable 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.229
 on the ps 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.959
 I would not feel what gives up 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.880
 to play fps with the beautiful was 64 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 I explained it on my video a 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 n64 collection precisely after I 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.480
 I loved to love thoroughly the 1 I very 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 liked the 2nd I loved the 3g party 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.930
 to play on the dreamcast with my 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.430
 brother so I bought his xbox 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.130
 it's a superb 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.930
 it's a great series but the case you 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:38.170
 know he's bad at 4 I'm very good 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 so we will show on the laf that I 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.750
 think the last day show this 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.340
 the game of the week 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.680
 I bought a new one at a 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 new pack for my collection 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.989
 sonic it's the super speed pack like 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.450
 you can see there is a little sodi 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.400
 cofidur in inside and both 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.590
 ds sonic games sega all stars racing 1 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 on ds and sonic colors of the two are 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.810
 in blister and the pack is also under 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.400
 blister scott will be intact on the other hand 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.819
 shit anyway stores 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.489
 to fuck the price tags in the east 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.459
 on the front and I have not too much 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.260
 forced I'm afraid to damage the pointer so 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.989
 it's a little stain good I you 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.049
 would put it like that maybe so is the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.880
 last game it's final fantasy it's a 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.780
 final fantasy on ps1 this is not the 7 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.769
 the 8th or the 9th 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.160
 it's final fantasy anthology this game 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.930
 contains 4 and 5 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.410
 yeah it contains so it contains the 4 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.000
 and the 5 with the manual 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.950
 I think I think these games were 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.650
 released on super nintendo but never 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.209
