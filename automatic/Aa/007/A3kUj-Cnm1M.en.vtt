00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to my eye you know to my you know square

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
to my eye you know to my you know square
I<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.580> look<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> surface<00:01:27.119> these

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I which I just look at the surface these

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
I which I just look at the surface these
lines<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:28.080> pretty<00:01:28.320> dead-on<00:01:28.560> san<00:01:28.920> Diego's<00:01:29.280> up

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
lines look pretty dead-on san Diego's up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
lines look pretty dead-on san Diego's up
one<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> half<00:01:29.880> point<00:01:30.270> home<00:01:30.750> favourite<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
one and a half point home favourite I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.480 
one and a half point home favourite I
think<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.650> line<00:01:31.860> should<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.159> pretty

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
think that line should be pretty

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.280 
think that line should be pretty
competitive<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.030> could<00:01:33.150> easily<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.570> either<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
competitive I could easily see either of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
competitive I could easily see either of
these<00:01:34.439> teams<00:01:34.619> winning<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> totals<00:01:35.670> 49<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
these teams winning it totals 49 and a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
these teams winning it totals 49 and a
half<00:01:36.630> which<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> pretty<00:01:37.229> high<00:01:37.470> both<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.979> like

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
half which is pretty high both have like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
half which is pretty high both have like
very<00:01:38.490> capable<00:01:38.820> offenses<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

up one way or another but this is a game
you<00:01:50.670> specifically<00:01:51.299> wanted<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> discuss<00:01:52.290> let's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you specifically wanted to discuss let's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.370 
you specifically wanted to discuss let's
see<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.710> dint<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.899> yeah<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
see we dint say about it yeah I like to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
see we dint say about it yeah I like to
total<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> over<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.520> points<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.090> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
total over the over the points here you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
total over the over the points here you
know<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> average<00:01:58.920> score<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.430> NFL

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
know I think the average score an NFL

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
know I think the average score an NFL
game<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.570> 23<00:02:01.200> points<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
game right now is about 23 points of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.340 
game right now is about 23 points of
team<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> looking<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.490> 46<00:02:03.090> points

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
team so you looking at about 46 points

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.350 
team so you looking at about 46 points
14<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:04.950> i<00:02:05.399> think<00:02:05.579> i<00:02:05.670> saw<00:02:05.850> study<00:02:06.149> not

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
14 right now and i think i saw study not

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
14 right now and i think i saw study not
too<00:02:06.509> long<00:02:06.630> ago<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.869> mean<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.409> been<00:02:07.619> growing

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
too long ago I mean that's been growing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
too long ago I mean that's been growing
up<00:02:07.920> each<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> last<00:02:08.489> three<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.879> four<00:02:08.910> years

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
up each of the last three or four years

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 
up each of the last three or four years
so<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.440> know<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.800> almost<00:02:10.920> getting<00:02:11.190> close

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so you know we're almost getting close

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490 
so you know we're almost getting close
to<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.640> average<00:02:11.760> game<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.450> 49<00:02:12.870> points

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to an average game here at 49 points

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.770 
to an average game here at 49 points
I<00:02:13.530> make<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> number<00:02:14.550> 51<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.360> think<00:02:15.450> we've<00:02:15.630> got

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I make a number 51 so I think we've got

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.950 
I make a number 51 so I think we've got
some<00:02:15.930> value<00:02:16.230> tuned<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> over<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
some value tuned to the over I and just

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.240 
some value tuned to the over I and just
a<00:02:19.110> couple<00:02:19.320> things<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.220> about

this first of all with both these teams

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.140 
this first of all with both these teams

averaging<00:02:50.550> offense<00:02:50.940> below<00:02:51.239> average<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
averaging offense below average and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500 
averaging offense below average and
defend<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.920> key<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:53.940> though<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.480> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
defend the key thing here though is I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.750 
defend the key thing here though is I
think<00:02:54.750> never<00:02:55.320> won<00:02:55.530> San<00:02:55.860> Diego<00:02:56.340> it'll<00:02:56.640> be<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
think never won San Diego it'll be a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
think never won San Diego it'll be a
pace<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.300> game<00:02:57.450> because<00:02:57.570> San<00:02:57.900> Diego<00:02:58.200> likes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
pace of the game because San Diego likes

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.930 
pace of the game because San Diego likes
to<00:02:58.770> throw<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.100> ball<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.459> throwing<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.790> ball

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
to throw the ball the throwing the ball

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
to throw the ball the throwing the ball
60-plus<00:03:00.600> percent<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> time<00:03:01.260> India<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.340> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
60-plus percent of the time India is a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.430 
60-plus percent of the time India is a
lot<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:02.760> balance<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.570> their<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.410> their

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
lot more balance in their in their

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.090 
lot more balance in their in their
attack<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.459> they<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.820> big<00:03:06.030> play<00:03:06.270> strike

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
attack but they have big play strike

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.040 
attack but they have big play strike
ability<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.310> Hilton<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.209> obviously<00:03:09.810> reggie

ability with Hilton and obviously reggie

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.979 
ability with Hilton and obviously reggie
wayne<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.730> San<00:03:11.970> Diego<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.390> pushing<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
wayne and so if San Diego is pushing the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.199 
wayne and so if San Diego is pushing the
action<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.500> scoring<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.280> little<00:03:14.489> bit<00:03:14.610> they

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
action and scoring a little bit they

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.790 
action and scoring a little bit they
will<00:03:15.390> they<00:03:15.570> will<00:03:15.600> push<00:03:15.930> India<00:03:16.260> into<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.590> type

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
will they will push India into that type

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.610 
will they will push India into that type
of<00:03:16.830> game<00:03:17.100> as<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:18.330> San<00:03:18.600> Diego<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.110> think<00:03:19.380> I

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
of game as well in San Diego I think I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
of game as well in San Diego I think I
think<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.340> line<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:21.390> his<00:03:21.540> podcast<00:03:22.019> two

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
think on this line with his podcast two

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.289 
think on this line with his podcast two
weeks<00:03:22.350> ago<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:22.950> am<00:03:23.070> be<00:03:23.250> over<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
weeks ago I think I am be over in the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.720 
weeks ago I think I am be over in the
Dallas<00:03:24.630> San<00:03:24.750> Diego<00:03:25.140> game<00:03:25.320> here<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.549> very

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
Dallas San Diego game here and for very

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.490 
Dallas San Diego game here and for very
similar<00:03:27.120> reasons<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:27.660> do<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:28.080> move<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.320> ball

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
similar reasons in do can move the ball

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.830 
similar reasons in do can move the ball
home<00:03:28.769> they<00:03:29.190> scored<00:03:29.489> 28<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.209> 30<00:03:30.420> points<00:03:30.750> at

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
home they scored 28 and 30 points at

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.110 
home they scored 28 and 30 points at
home<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.200> year<00:03:31.260> they're<00:03:31.860> games<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.310> total<00:03:32.610> 59

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
home this year they're games of total 59

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.170 
home this year they're games of total 59
and<00:03:33.420> 51<00:03:33.959> points<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.519> think<00:03:35.670> they'll<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.090> able

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and 51 points so I think they'll be able

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.430 
and 51 points so I think they'll be able
to<00:03:36.269> get<00:03:36.450> their<00:03:36.600> share<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.989> points<00:03:37.320> even

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to get their share the points even

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.650 
to get their share the points even
against<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.830> good<00:03:37.980> Andy<00:03:38.280> team<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.730> India<00:03:39.570> is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
against a good Andy team and India is

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.259 
against a good Andy team and India is
Indy<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:39.989> mean<00:03:40.320> Andy<00:03:40.620> Andrew<00:03:41.310> Luck<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:42.030> just

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
Indy I mean Andy Andrew Luck is is just

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.479 
Indy I mean Andy Andrew Luck is is just
key<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.720> guy<00:03:42.900> event<00:03:43.230> winner<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.190> he<00:03:44.340> will

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
key in that guy event winner and he will

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.250 
key in that guy event winner and he will
move<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.760> ball<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.180> they've<00:03:45.480> got<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.079> big

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
move the ball and they've got the big

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.470 
move the ball and they've got the big
play<00:03:46.440> receivers<00:03:47.010> they<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.670> run<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> ball<00:03:48.030> I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
play receivers they can run the ball I

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.030 
play receivers they can run the ball I
think<00:03:49.110> they're<00:03:49.230> going<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.380> easily<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.829> able<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
think they're going to easily be able to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.890 
think they're going to easily be able to
score<00:03:50.280> into<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.760> 20s<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.390> game<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.810> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
score into the 20s in this game and I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330 
score into the 20s in this game and I
think<00:03:52.110> San<00:03:52.320> Diego<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.709> get<00:03:52.829> their<00:03:52.980> points<00:03:53.250> in

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
think San Diego will get their points in

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.380 
think San Diego will get their points in
this<00:03:53.430> game<00:03:53.519> as<00:03:53.820> well<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:55.130> 27-24<00:03:56.130> game<00:03:56.459> final

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
this game as well a 27-24 game final

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.090 
this game as well a 27-24 game final
would<00:03:57.690> not<00:03:57.900> surprise<00:03:58.230> me<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
would not surprise me at all and

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.319 
would not surprise me at all and
obviously<00:03:59.430> that's<00:03:59.610> enough<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.000> push<00:04:00.180> this

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
obviously that's enough to push this

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.210 
obviously that's enough to push this
thing<00:04:00.510> over<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.780> total<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.560> think<00:04:02.010> there's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
thing over a total so I think there's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.770 
thing over a total so I think there's
value<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> numbers<00:04:03.060> as<00:04:03.180> far<00:04:03.360> as<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.570> make

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
value with the numbers as far as I make

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.569 
value with the numbers as far as I make
them<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.590> pace<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:05.070> what<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.340> will

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
them and just the pace of what this will

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.759 
them and just the pace of what this will
do<00:04:05.700> in<00:04:05.850> san<00:04:06.480> diego<00:04:06.630> will<00:04:06.930> force<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.350> action<00:04:07.709> a

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
do in san diego will force that action a

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.979 
do in san diego will force that action a
little<00:04:07.980> bit<00:04:08.130> which<00:04:08.730> will<00:04:08.940> take<00:04:09.120> indian<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.959> a

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
little bit which will take indian to a

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.470 
little bit which will take indian to a
little<00:04:10.320> bit<00:04:10.440> more<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.250> an<00:04:11.340> unbalanced<00:04:11.970> attack

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
little bit more of an unbalanced attack

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.870 
little bit more of an unbalanced attack
and<00:04:13.230> they're<00:04:13.860> capable<00:04:14.040> throwing<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> ball

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and they're capable throwing the ball

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.219 
and they're capable throwing the ball
all<00:04:15.030> over<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.299> place<00:04:15.480> much<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.959> they<00:04:16.049> did
