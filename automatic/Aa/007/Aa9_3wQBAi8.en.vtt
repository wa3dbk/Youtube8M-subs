be reading my sweet spot and what I use

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
be reading my sweet spot and what I use

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
for my serpent it read just seems to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.169 
for my serpent it read just seems to
make<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:08.399> comfortable<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.940> traction

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
makes the car fooled is really stable

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.650 
makes the car fooled is really stable
not<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.459> oversteer

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
not to oversteer

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.450 
not to oversteer
and<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.320> probably<00:02:13.650> something<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.010> will<00:02:14.250> keep

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and it's probably something I will keep

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.940 
and it's probably something I will keep
for<00:02:14.760> quite<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> while<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.570> game<00:02:15.810> moving<00:02:16.800> on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
for quite a while in this game moving on

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
for quite a while in this game moving on
to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> alignment<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.990> way<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to the alignment now as all the way to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
to the alignment now as all the way to
left<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> camber<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> get

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
left for the camber that is just to get

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
left for the camber that is just to get
the<00:02:21.570> maximum<00:02:22.080> responsiveness<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the maximum responsiveness but for the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.240 
the maximum responsiveness but for the
toad<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.260> maximize<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
toad that is really just to maximize the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
toad that is really just to maximize the
traction<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.820> much<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.270> possible<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
traction as much as possible and the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.200 
traction as much as possible and the
straight-line<00:02:28.800> speed<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.280> well<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.180> not

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
straight-line speed as well so I'm not

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.820 
straight-line speed as well so I'm not
really<00:02:30.480> looking<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.960> responsive<00:02:31.470> conserve

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
really looking for responsive conserve

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.830 
really looking for responsive conserve
but<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> really<00:02:32.460> traction<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> huge<00:02:33.600> huge

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
but a really traction is a huge huge

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.270 
but a really traction is a huge huge
part<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.260> game<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.920> reason

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
part of this game so that's the reason

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.370 
part of this game so that's the reason
why<00:02:35.370> I've<00:02:35.490> done<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.240> as<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
why I've done that and as for the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.220 
why I've done that and as for the
suspension<00:02:37.740> 11-1<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> actual

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
suspension 11-1 for the actual

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.600 
suspension 11-1 for the actual
suspension<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.220> straight-line

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
suspension just for the straight-line

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.660 
suspension just for the straight-line
speed<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.170> 11:4<00:02:43.170> pretty<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.460> get

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
speed and 11:4 pretty much just to get

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.280 
speed and 11:4 pretty much just to get
that<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.270> more<00:02:45.420> traction<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.930> got<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> little

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that bit more traction it's got a little

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
that bit more traction it's got a little
bit<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.470> Turner<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.250> more<00:02:48.210> built

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
bit of Turner but it's really more built

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600 
bit of Turner but it's really more built
well<00:02:48.750> built<00:02:49.590> ground<00:02:49.770> gaining<00:02:50.160> traction<00:02:50.310> which

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
well built ground gaining traction which

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.310 
well built ground gaining traction which
is<00:02:50.700> very<00:02:50.940> important<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.360> game<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.990> tire

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
is very important this game as a tire

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.380 
is very important this game as a tire
pressures<00:02:52.740> John<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.880> not<00:02:53.910> really

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
pressures John you're not really

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440 
pressures John you're not really
changing<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.050> TT<00:02:55.500> asked<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:56.520> bat<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.270> is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
changing in TT asked my bat so it is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.600 
changing in TT asked my bat so it is
eight<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.680> definitely<00:02:58.920> need<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.370> bit<00:02:59.580> of

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
eight and you definitely need a bit of

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.920 
eight and you definitely need a bit of
turning<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.120> high<00:03:00.240> speed<00:03:00.510> direction

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
turning for the high speed direction

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
turning for the high speed direction
this<00:03:01.020> track<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.220> hope<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.850> guys<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.360> been
