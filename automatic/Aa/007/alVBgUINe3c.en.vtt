down on top and I'll be the fabric just
stops<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> cut<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.650> further<00:01:04.830> springless<00:01:05.659> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
stops the cut and further springless the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
stops the cut and further springless the
same<00:01:06.869> thing<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.229> either<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.710> fine<00:01:08.210> put<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> cover

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
same thing as either so fine put a cover

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
same thing as either so fine put a cover
over<00:01:09.630> otherwise<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> springs<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.830> cut

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
over otherwise the springs will just cut

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
over otherwise the springs will just cut
through<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> phones<00:01:11.900> we're<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> jump

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
through the phones we're going to jump

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.929 
through the phones we're going to jump
it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> fabric<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.310> we'll<00:01:14.460> glue<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it's a fabric here we'll glue there and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's a fabric here we'll glue there and
then<00:01:15.390> we'll<00:01:15.540> sit<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.590> they

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
then we'll sit them on top and they

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.899 
then we'll sit them on top and they
should<00:01:16.979> hold<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> together<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> we've

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
should hold it all in together so we've

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
should hold it all in together so we've
got<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> cover<00:01:22.080> over<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> springs<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> they'll

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
got a cover over the springs and they'll

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
got a cover over the springs and they'll
just<00:01:23.280> stop<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> cutting<00:01:24.000> through<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.420> see

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
just stop the cutting through you see

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.380 
just stop the cutting through you see
wrist<00:01:24.840> cut<00:01:25.110> through<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.970> put<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> cover<00:01:27.299> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
wrist cut through here put the cover on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.789 
wrist cut through here put the cover on
here<00:01:27.600> we'll<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> stop<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
here we'll just stop that and make it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
here we'll just stop that and make it
last<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.159> whole<00:01:29.250> lot<00:01:29.340> longer<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.259> put<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> fire

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
last a whole lot longer so put the fire

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
last a whole lot longer so put the fire
on<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.250> what's<00:01:32.460> next

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
on and see what's next

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.610 

so<00:01:35.190> I've<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> seed<00:01:35.730> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.910> back<00:01:36.620> we've

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
so I've got the seed in the back we've

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.010 
so I've got the seed in the back we've
got<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.980> farms<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> raised<00:01:39.450> pieces<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
got the farms for the raised pieces in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.300 
got the farms for the raised pieces in
the<00:01:40.080> middle<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.500> puts<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> path<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the middle but puts in path in the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.650 
the middle but puts in path in the
center<00:01:42.350> times<00:01:43.350> will<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.620> fixed<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:45.300> can<00:01:45.510> go

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
center times will be fixed up you can go

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.760 
center times will be fixed up you can go
to<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> sides<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.680> coat<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:47.190> paint<00:01:48.770> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to the sides a bit of a coat of paint so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
to the sides a bit of a coat of paint so
we'll<00:01:49.860> start<00:01:50.130> cutting<00:01:50.340> out<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.700> material<00:01:51.180> now

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we'll start cutting out the material now

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.120 
we'll start cutting out the material now
and<00:01:51.800> put<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.040> together

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
and put the thing together

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.910 
and put the thing together
well<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.690> seat<00:01:57.690> all<00:01:58.320> finished<00:01:58.860> now

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
well there the seat all finished now

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.790 
well there the seat all finished now
slightly<00:01:59.550> different<00:02:00.020> tradition<00:02:01.020> water<00:02:01.530> came

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
slightly different tradition water came

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.490 
slightly different tradition water came
in<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.490> sure<00:02:02.670> nice<00:02:03.030> cloth<00:02:03.300> inserts
