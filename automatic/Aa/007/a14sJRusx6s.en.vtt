it's pretty pretty amazing to have a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.340 
it's pretty pretty amazing to have a
place<00:04:27.940> like<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.240> in<00:04:28.450> Queensland<00:04:28.990> now<00:04:29.140> I<00:04:29.170> mean

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
place like this in Queensland now I mean

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.800 
place like this in Queensland now I mean
it's<00:04:29.530> how<00:04:30.070> difficult<00:04:30.850> was<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.450> get<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it's how difficult was it to get the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.090 
it's how difficult was it to get the
animals<00:04:32.200> here<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.650> all<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.740> sort<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.040> stuff

animals here and all that sort of stuff
it's<00:04:33.550> been<00:04:33.790> remarkable<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:35.140> that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
it's been remarkable and I think that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.290 
it's been remarkable and I think that
that<00:04:35.740> strategy<00:04:36.190> was<00:04:36.640> real<00:04:36.820> forward-thinking

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
that strategy was real forward-thinking

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.510 
that strategy was real forward-thinking
so<00:04:37.900> four<00:04:38.200> years<00:04:38.230> ago<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:39.040> was<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.190> beginning

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so four years ago it was the beginning

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.630 
so four years ago it was the beginning
of<00:04:39.820> getting<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.750> animals<00:04:41.170> in<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.740> early<00:04:42.490> on
