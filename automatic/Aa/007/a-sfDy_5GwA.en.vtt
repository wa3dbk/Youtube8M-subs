00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.970
 Everything is possible, a Borussia discovered 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.940
 who arrived at the santiago bernabéu stadium 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.670
 enlarged by a five to one obtained 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.620
 at the German stadium at the meeting of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.650
 The truth is that this real madrid 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.230
 that we have seen suffered the unspeakable for 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.800
 take a qualifier forward 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.539
 was on November 27 , 1985 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.980
 and again real Madrid was going to suffer 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.960
 first opportunity for the team 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 German and goal and the truth is that he had 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.329
 fought was the night of v run author of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.239
 two goals from Borussia a lot in Galdar 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.970
 by the way jupp heynckes former coach 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.860
 Real Madrid 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.870
 champion of the seventh European Cup with 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.540
 the white team was the technician too 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.970
 of Borussia there have been great players 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.840
 from borussia mönchengladbach that later 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.710
 rain has come to Spanish football 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.870
 weather rain of goals for the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.460
 borussia although he did make up the result 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.070
 Rafael Gordillo was cold and wore 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.350
 gloves with that 41 but at the last minute the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
 fifth goal of Borussia left things 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.620
 practically impossible for the real 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.110
 madrid but there was nothing for this real 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.630
 madrid of the impossible comebacks and was going 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.490
 to come the night of ecstasy the cut 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.190
 by juan gómez juanito the auction at 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.070

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.990
 de jorge valdano 2 to 0 with goals for 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.490
 today general sports director of the real 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.770
 Madrid 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.770
 Real Madrid was coming up with two goals 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.539
 more was enough 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.149
 Attention to the opportunity of Borussia 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.880
 I was going to put the lump in my throat 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:45.130
 Realmadrid care that escapes 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.409
 to leave miguelángel fails uff 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.149
 the bernabéu celebrates 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.009
 to get the third goal of the real 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.890
 madrid in the absence of 17 minutes for the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.659
 final arrives Carlos Alonso Santillana 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.789
 eternal captain to pass from mechel and he makes 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.799
 the 3 to 0 was a goal of celebration 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.909
 there he is going to arrive he is going to arrive 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.679
 santillana 40 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.679
 It was like to lose consciousness 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.310
 and I think that in that game when 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.310
 we got the room practically there 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.730
 a needle in and we felt it because it was 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 so much the emotion that we had drunk that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.830
 lived that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.830
 that we were emotional we made the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.450
 90 min I felt that the governor was 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.730
 transformed into a cataclysm, that is, 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.360
 I lost the notion of where I was 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.129
 So great is the joy and passion that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.129
 transmitted people 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.420
 live a situation of disconnection and / or 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.370
 I believe that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 It's something that I find very difficult 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.740
 explain it because I never experienced it before 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.420
 never again 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.760
 there is an image that is worth more than a thousand 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.760
 words is juan gómez juanito
