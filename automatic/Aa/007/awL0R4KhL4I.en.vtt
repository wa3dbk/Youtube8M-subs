00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.830
 speaks guys on video lesson today I will 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.650
 explain to you how does a glass 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
 blasted with the king for sketchup ok 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 the result will be more or less 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 like this one here you can 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.270
 see what the material further away is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 lowest in the club is closest 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.850
 so come on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.420
 I wanted to take the scenery here just to 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.790
 do the tutorial even I go for it 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:36.690
 its download link in the description of the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 video on low and I grew 2006 two 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:49.769
 we are here that I will use as the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:51.479
 glass is a publisher material 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:59.760
 here they already had that I created but we go 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:01:03.829
 create another right click here for glass 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.119
 two that already have limited power because 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.409
 in your spaces when you rename 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.329
 in these 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.329
 credits editor material 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.770
 good 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.600
 the effect of the blasted glass is very easy 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.130
 basically consists of the layer of 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.649
 refraction will click right 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.649
 in creating here read of refraction 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.009
 the only thing you will change is a 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.539
 little of the r &amp; b next in refraction taaa 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 I will not change too much, I'll put it on. 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.430
 I think it might be that the number 95 is good 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
 I'm going to change next month. 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:55.760
 In that one I used 90 but I'm going to use 80 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.760
 people here just so you can see the example 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.030
 and grandma 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.030
 I'll apply here on my 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.970
 my guilty guilty must take 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.970
 transparency of the fuzeta 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.090
 here in rifle transfer you 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 put white ready changed to white 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.000
 now I'm going to render it for you to see 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 the result 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.230
 soon concluded this is the result with 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.060
 value of 80 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.170
 I'll post on the blog as it gets with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.850
 several others and with all the others 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.000
 results you can see the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.530
 difference does not have much to explain 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 basically the key is to just mess around 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.970
 value of blogs and up to a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
 result you want I'll leave the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.330
 Tabelle there for you, you do not have to stay. 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.560
 rendering all the time just for you 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
 have notion 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
