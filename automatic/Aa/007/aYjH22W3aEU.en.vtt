um<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.620> weight<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.430> guns<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.940> really

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
um the weight of the guns is really

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.490 
um the weight of the guns is really
really<00:01:38.420> interesting<00:01:38.659> because<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.080> you're

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
really interesting because you you're

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.899 
really interesting because you you're
firing<00:01:39.830> all<00:01:40.070> these<00:01:40.190> different<00:01:40.370> high-tech

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
firing all these different high-tech

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.370 
firing all these different high-tech
machinery<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.780> feels<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.260> you're

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
machinery and it feels like you're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.020 
machinery and it feels like you're
actually<00:01:42.500> holding<00:01:42.860> really<00:01:43.190> hefty<00:01:43.310> an<00:01:43.549> amazing

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
actually holding really hefty an amazing

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.550 
actually holding really hefty an amazing
sound<00:01:44.270> design<00:01:44.540> as<00:01:44.690> well<00:01:44.720> like<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.229> weapons

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
sound design as well like the weapons

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.010 
sound design as well like the weapons
really<00:01:46.159> pop<00:01:46.370> pistols<00:01:46.820> pop<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.360> young<00:01:47.630> guns<00:01:47.810> go

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
really pop pistols pop and young guns go

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.870 
really pop pistols pop and young guns go
off<00:01:48.049> really<00:01:48.380> really<00:01:48.740> sweet<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.370> guns<00:01:49.610> that's

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
off really really sweet so guns that's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.340 
off really really sweet so guns that's
sort<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.180> half<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.600> arsenal<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.020> other<00:01:51.140> half

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
sort of half the arsenal the other half

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.830 
sort of half the arsenal the other half
is<00:01:51.620> this<00:01:51.830> neural<00:01:52.250> chip<00:01:52.280> ability<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.390> hack<00:01:53.600> into

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
is this neural chip ability to hack into

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.930 
is this neural chip ability to hack into
people's<00:01:54.260> brains<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:55.040> yes<00:01:55.520> check<00:01:55.790> their

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
people's brains and yes check their

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.219 
people's brains and yes check their
Gmail<00:01:56.299> or<00:01:56.540> whatever<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> hell<00:01:56.930> you're<00:01:57.080> doing

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
Gmail or whatever the hell you're doing

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.750 
Gmail or whatever the hell you're doing
in<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.320> future<00:01:57.440> talk<00:01:58.250> about<00:01:58.460> those<00:01:58.580> abilities

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
in the future talk about those abilities

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.430 
in the future talk about those abilities
so<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.299> have<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.630> dart<00:01:59.900> ability<00:02:00.290> which

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
so you have that dart ability which

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.260 
so you have that dart ability which
allows<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.920> kind<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.190> slow<00:02:01.430> down<00:02:01.610> time<00:02:01.909> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
allows you to kind of slow down time and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.539 
allows you to kind of slow down time and
then<00:02:02.690> take<00:02:03.049> out<00:02:03.170> enemies<00:02:03.470> as<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.680> will<00:02:03.860> and

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
then take out enemies as you will and

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.010 
then take out enemies as you will and
that<00:02:04.670> orange<00:02:05.030> glow<00:02:05.240> lets<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.540> see<00:02:05.720> where<00:02:05.900> they

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that orange glow lets you see where they

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.619 
that orange glow lets you see where they
are<00:02:06.200> hiding<00:02:06.760> but<00:02:07.760> even<00:02:07.880> better<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.420> you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
are hiding but even better is that you

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.999 
are hiding but even better is that you
have<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> ability<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.259> kind<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.500> take<00:02:09.830> over

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
have the ability to kind of take over

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.500 
have the ability to kind of take over
different<00:02:10.729> people's<00:02:10.970> chips<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> can

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
different people's chips so you can

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.479 
different people's chips so you can
persuade<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> guard<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.560> kill<00:02:12.799> other<00:02:12.950> guards<00:02:13.340> or

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
persuade a guard to kill other guards or

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.619 
persuade a guard to kill other guards or
even<00:02:13.760> persuade<00:02:14.000> them<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.180> take<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.480> himself

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
even persuade them to take out himself

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.720 
even persuade them to take out himself
yeah<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.379> can<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.739> overclock<00:02:16.220> their<00:02:16.430> brains

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
yeah you can like overclock their brains

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.610 
yeah you can like overclock their brains
and<00:02:17.030> basically<00:02:17.330> they<00:02:17.510> explode<00:02:17.930> yep<00:02:18.379> they

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
and basically they explode yep they

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.020 
and basically they explode yep they
shouldn't<00:02:18.920> fette<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.250> blood<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.760> kill<00:02:19.879> other

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
shouldn't fette in blood and kill other

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.070 
shouldn't fette in blood and kill other
people<00:02:20.180> around<00:02:20.450> them<00:02:20.629> yeah<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:20.989> pretty

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
people around them yeah it's pretty

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.110 
people around them yeah it's pretty
brutal<00:02:21.260> yeah<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.099> if<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.370> hack<00:02:22.610> or<00:02:22.910> breach

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
brutal yeah and if you hack or breach

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.600 
brutal yeah and if you hack or breach
your<00:02:23.330> enemy<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.959> again

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
your enemy you can again

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.890 
your enemy you can again
then<00:02:24.730> commit<00:02:24.940> suicide<00:02:24.970> persuade<00:02:25.720> them<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
then commit suicide persuade them to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900 
then commit suicide persuade them to
fight<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.440> love<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.770> stuff<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.760> talk

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
fight for you love that stuff let's talk

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.250 
fight for you love that stuff let's talk
about<00:02:28.030> those<00:02:28.210> weapons<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.750> there<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.080> said

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
about those weapons that there you said

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.080 
about those weapons that there you said
I<00:02:29.290> mean<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.890> very<00:02:30.070> hefty<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
I mean it's very hefty but is it the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
I mean it's very hefty but is it the
traditional<00:02:31.390> pistol<00:02:31.930> shotgun<00:02:32.140> round<00:02:32.500> or

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
traditional pistol shotgun round or

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.900 
traditional pistol shotgun round or
something<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.250> there's<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.820> that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
something like there's some of that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.790 
something like there's some of that
obviously<00:02:34.240> pistols<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.930> machine<00:02:35.560> guns<00:02:35.680> but

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
obviously pistols and machine guns but

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.600 
obviously pistols and machine guns but
there's<00:02:35.950> also<00:02:36.070> something<00:02:36.310> more<00:02:36.490> exotic

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
there's also something more exotic

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.090 
there's also something more exotic
weaponry<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.410> guns<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.560> lock<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
weaponry like guns that lock on to a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.680 
weaponry like guns that lock on to a
target<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.520> then<00:02:39.580> true<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.090> track<00:02:40.390> into

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
target and then true and then track into

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.690 
target and then true and then track into
people<00:02:40.930> around<00:02:41.080> corners<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:41.830> swarm<00:02:42.310> rocket

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
people around corners or swarm rocket

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.100 
people around corners or swarm rocket
launchers<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.090> all<00:02:43.360> sorts<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.630> really<00:02:43.870> cool

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
launchers and all sorts a really cool

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.380 
launchers and all sorts a really cool
futuristic<00:02:44.920> tech<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.610> said<00:02:45.790> exotic<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.300> there

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
futuristic tech you said exotic is there

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.540 
futuristic tech you said exotic is there
a<00:02:46.420> machine<00:02:46.660> gun<00:02:46.810> Lamborghini<00:02:47.230> yes<00:02:47.650> yes<00:02:48.100> that's

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.090 
a machine gun Lamborghini yes yes that's
what<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.790> want<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.330> need<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.930> my<00:02:49.960> life<00:02:50.100> so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
what I want I need that in my life so

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.040 
what I want I need that in my life so
this<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.370> some<00:02:51.490> of<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.640> dart<00:02:51.850> system<00:02:52.060> we'll

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
this is some of the dart system we'll

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.270 
this is some of the dart system we'll
see<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.410> second<00:02:53.620> here<00:02:53.740> being<00:02:53.920> used<00:02:54.070> there<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
see in a second here being used there it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.710 
see in a second here being used there it
is<00:02:54.370> sort<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> black<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.240> white<00:02:55.300> again<00:02:55.510> you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
is sort of black and white again you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.030 
is sort of black and white again you
mentioned<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:55.990> orange<00:02:56.290> outline<00:02:56.530> which<00:02:56.860> lets

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
mentioned the orange outline which lets

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.590 
mentioned the orange outline which lets
you<00:02:57.100> see<00:02:57.220> explosive<00:02:57.670> canisters<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.150> enemies

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
you see explosive canisters and enemies

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.910 
you see explosive canisters and enemies
but<00:02:58.900> what<00:02:59.020> else<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.380> do<00:02:59.530> from<00:02:59.890> that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
but what else can we do from that

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.340 
but what else can we do from that
overlay<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.760> obviously<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.690> gets<00:03:01.870> slow<00:03:02.110> down

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
overlay so obviously it gets slow down

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.120 
overlay so obviously it gets slow down
and<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.650> see<00:03:02.800> all<00:03:02.830> your<00:03:03.010> different

of<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.770> game<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.070> remember<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.550> like

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
of the game but I remember here like

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.580 
of the game but I remember here like
those<00:03:24.850> cryo<00:03:25.150> chambers<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.750> could<00:03:25.930> hack<00:03:26.350> into

those cryo chambers you could hack into

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.050 
those cryo chambers you could hack into
then<00:03:26.770> retract<00:03:27.220> them<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.580> if<00:03:27.640> an<00:03:27.730> enemy<00:03:27.850> was

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
then retract them so if an enemy was

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.880 
then retract them so if an enemy was
hidden<00:03:28.239> behind<00:03:28.420> them<00:03:28.750> good<00:03:29.170> again<00:03:29.410> attack<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
hidden behind them good again attack the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.470 
hidden behind them good again attack the
enemy<00:03:30.130> go<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.489> turret<00:03:30.700> or<00:03:30.850> change<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
enemy go for the turret or change the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.820 
enemy go for the turret or change the
landscape<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.019> they<00:03:32.110> no<00:03:32.230> longer<00:03:32.350> had<00:03:32.620> that

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
landscape so they no longer had that

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.080 
landscape so they no longer had that
before<00:03:32.890> bring<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.340> out<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.670> have<00:03:34.000> the
