00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.359
 Petya Princess today talk about the very 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 mainly difference 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.490
 but in 4 from the previous parts of the series 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 be sure to put likes if you want 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.350
 see more videos on this game and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.449
 let's start a long time ago you guessed it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 what's the biggest difference 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 fnaf 4 from past parts is complete 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.240
 lack of video cameras and tablet on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 really very interesting move which 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 fully 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 changes the gameplay and make it perfectly 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.399
 others as we know 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.829
 distinctive feature of the game series 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.680
 five nights with freddie was just that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.559
 that it was necessary to play a guard who 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 always stayed in one place and not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 could go anywhere and also watched 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.629
 animatronics through video cameras 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.550
 This gameplay mechanics immediately fell in love 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 many people 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.239
 watching animatronics through 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.350
 camcorder was something new and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.140
 unique 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.409
 However, it is not clear why in the fourth 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.080
 parts scott decided to do things differently 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 but let's not underestimate scott 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.810
 Russia and we will believe that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.799
 the fourth part will be the worst 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 throughout the series 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.009
 Now we take the trailer and try 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.080
 suggest how will be implemented 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 moving around the room out of use 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 trailer cameras can be seen 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 that a child can't get out of its 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 rooms maybe he's just scared 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.979
 but the fact is it that not leaving the room 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.140
 it will most likely be possible 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.229
 fast moving forward ie 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.010
 the child will be able to fit the doors to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.200
 the room 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 and peeking to scare 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 animatronics from their room also 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.360
 will be able to turn around and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.310
 look back or go to the closet 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.220
 peek inside or hide heed 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.320
 also think that when you close his door 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 it was necessary to keep it not 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.470
 has opened 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.100
 and if you move away from it to open Leary 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.120
 again 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.970
 so itâ€™s not possible to close 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.880
 all doors also in the trailer there is one 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.090
 interesting corridor to follow 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.880
 for cuhoy I hope you enjoy the issue and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.300
