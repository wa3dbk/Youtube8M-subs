00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.210
 two years ago apple 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 presented what they call today 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.349
 smart watch the first model was 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 Worked with iphone and android we are essentially 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.769
 only displayed notifications they were 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 very plastic and feel 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.820
 articles as cheap as seemingly now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.350
 appeared chat this 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 functional smart watch on this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 moment by and large it's just 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.789
 improved pebble but time has a pair 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.949
 new products are the most significant 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 the difference is chatting for $ 199 from 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 previous models is a new color 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.750
 display 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 this is not a bright eye-catching screen he 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 displays only a few pretty 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
 muted colors 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 they are not very bright even indoors 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.309
 The resolution is low so you body is good 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.100
 are visible 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.219
 but they always work especially on the street 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 because it reflects sunlight 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.610
 transition from black and white color screen 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 this is big progress he is not particularly 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 something changes the design of the model to embody 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.730
 refined compared to the first fable 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 ii pebble steel which came out in the past 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.809
 year they are light tanks with a slight bend 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 to better fit their wrists 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.260
 comfortable to wear and they are quite small 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.790
 do not look like a computer on hand 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 medium sized around display 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.180
 steel frame 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.189
 but they were on the plastic is not very 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 nice you can either love either 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.430
 hate retro design pb one nile not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 Time rolls on four buttons, one on the left and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.290
 30 right also has a microphone for recording 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
 dorm voices are well protected against water 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.580
 the company reports that they can be started 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.729
 to a depth of 30 meters I just checked 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 their souls here are a standard strap on 22 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.509
 millimeter and comes with rubber 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 With quick-release function port for 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.780
 charging now from behind and not from the side and he 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.729
 can also transfer data 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 potentially it is very important as 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.670
 accessories manufacturer can 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.590
 take advantage of this to create these 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 bags that use this port but for now 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 this is unrealized potential because 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 b was not yet released so-called 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.560
 smart bags just like the others 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.240
 manufacturers 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.979
 besides new electronics on time 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.390
 but influencing new software 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.610
 which gives the new interface 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 there is no longer that utilitarian interface 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.509
 time now offers personalization 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.369
 funny animation with unusual details 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.200
 it is built upon so 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.030
 called the chain of events of all that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 what happens in your life from the past 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.959
 to the near future in the center of the chain 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.519
 event dial for which there is 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.780
 many options but only a few 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.150
 support color screen 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.010
 press up and see events for 36 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.780
 hours game results weather forecast and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.250
 so then press down will appear 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.560
 scheduled event program 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.850
 TV shows and tomorrow's weather with design 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.739
 allows you to get the most 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.299
 Information at a glance and you do not need 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.100
 browse the app and wait bye 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.299
 they will boot most often by was 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.920
 works but for good 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.540
 functioning need to give information 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.069
 from various applications and on this 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 moment only a few are capable of it 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.980
 The notice on the time is not different old 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.569
 pebble versions 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.730
 except that colors can be added 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.530
 receive notification from iphone from android 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.239
 but android users can send 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.549
 quick answers and use the app 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 to reply to an e-mail with an iPhone you can 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.620
 just remove the message that is not very 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.880
 convenient if you wanted to manage mail 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.680
 exclusive feature for android on 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.299
 dictation of messages that used to be 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.100
 only possible with android 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.380
 or apple watch but can not be used 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.510
 voice for another to launch applications 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.250
 or search and this is a small slip by 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.359
 compared with the old have a chat 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.579
 faster and more fashionable 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.620
 batteries work just as well and you can 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.660
 walk four days without recharging what is not 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.609
 7 days as the company promises but much 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.920
 more than apple watch or android in 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.930
 besides these improvements the main idea is to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.000
 was not changed over time main 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.250
 function get smartphone wrist and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
 it is either very necessary or absolutely 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.420
 useless pebble time 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.220
 this is an improved version of pebble which is cool 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.739
 for those who liked the first pebble 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.350
 but if you are undecided 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.680
 smart watches the time will not help you here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.220
