00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.300
 the lioness clinic of soccer to the child dt of the seven of the ten years and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 others for 11 to 17 years old 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.279
 then two envoys are sent 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 she is a program with the state department and in the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 football association of the united states so that young people do not get involved 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.030
 with one day I told myself with the gangs and control 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.420
 finish 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.569
 they are here to tell you that clinics 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.440
 to young people to coaches 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 so that two young people aboard children have 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.090
 an alternative such as what I can do is patent in him 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.450
 for me in the fight against the standards of violence of the 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
 gangs and drugs 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.020
 It's very nice because they are sharing a record with their classmates 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.649
 and thus be able to distract saet from other activities that could harm the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.020
 stellar health the biggest threat is the lack of productive things and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810
 constructive things to do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.450
 for youth 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.800
 and this problem is not only this obviously here in El Salvador but it is 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.720
 from all over the world even in the united states if the youth has nothing 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 do what 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.760
 or that is productive that is constructive to want to tell 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.660
 things 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.200
 malaysia second part other ways more to spend time 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.810
 and that can include things like gangs or just crime 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.570
 like elton projects like this was 70 medicare that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960
 that's why you see children 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.090
 to the capacities of deputies and also someone working as a team 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.480
 esteem theater 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.700
 and also from the Roman side level of human activity
