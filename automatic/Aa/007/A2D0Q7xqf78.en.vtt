compression straps are still not fully

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.570 
compression straps are still not fully
open<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:22.150> now<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.720> had<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> lot<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.190> space

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
open so now I had I have a lot of space

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.190 
open so now I had I have a lot of space
and<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:26.080> just<00:02:26.769> fascinated<00:02:27.070> by<00:02:27.670> by<00:02:28.269> how<00:02:28.570> small

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and I'm just fascinated by by how small

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.949 
and I'm just fascinated by by how small
it<00:02:29.380> looks<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:31.180> huge<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.690> I

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
it looks like but it's huge so I

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.199 
it looks like but it's huge so I
realized<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:33.250> not<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> size<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:33.880> it

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
realized that it's not the size that it

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.500 
realized that it's not the size that it
matters<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.750> how<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.959> feel<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.040> know

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
matters it's how you feel it in you know

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.920 
matters it's how you feel it in you know
so<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.920> thing<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.760> love<00:02:40.000> about<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.660> that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.240 

this<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:55.000> how<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.270> fits<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:56.770> looks<00:04:56.980> great<00:04:57.310> and

this is how it fits it looks great and
yeah<00:05:00.250> by<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.490> way<00:05:00.670> I<00:05:00.820> didn't<00:05:01.150> know<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.360> I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
yeah by the way I didn't know that I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.320 
yeah by the way I didn't know that I
have<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.930> use<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.350> strap<00:05:03.190> all<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.120> time
