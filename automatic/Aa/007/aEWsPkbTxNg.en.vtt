00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.980
 Of course we go very different 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.870
 whereas we wanted to drink coffee 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.420
 yes, the perspective change yes so 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.760
 out of the garden into the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.369
 drywall so to speak and a bit 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.539
 look what we have so beautiful and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.539
 what did we notice? 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.119
 Anyone should have three weeks 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.029
 the stone house stepped 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:41.760
 we could use again 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:44.850
 forgot my water water water 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 water changed earth will find so 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 we should put it in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.379
 yes and then above all else to plant 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.449
 the thermo provide the drywall 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.410
 earn with cover sheet 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.670
 plants mittwede marten 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.199
 we still have to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 Preparations meet or catch 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.170
 first to plant a few plants and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.730
 then there is something in between like the old one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.090
 Stone has to go in and then we feel that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.979
 Gaps 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.890
 that means I have one already 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 bit loamy earth taken namely 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.330
 Earth is best for that one sees completely 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.860
 good if you live today is that you are so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 a little chat can be such a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.770
 a little bit of putty and that make 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.840
 we just go in here completely 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 that for too much and then let's have a look 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 experience in stone on this surface 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.210
 that should be enough to rock that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.950
 stone firmly, and then fill the gaps with 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 I like this on both sides until I find 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.040
 that looks nice now or you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 just those are a bit ask 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.930
 the beautiful earth to smooch for the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.520
 make finger dirty 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.820
 yes, of course, and what to finger 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 in the earth not a good day 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.049
 just look it is already too late have I 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.799
 luck I did not pick up a pants floor 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.450
 not known and study then come 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.149
 makes her talk take a bit 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.680
 then we will talk about it now 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.979
 Amelie Stein relined because of that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.209
 was funny with the planer 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.790
 and then you do not have to do it anymore 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.500
 that's not enough weight 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.239
 bring it into one 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.980
 Dry wall, he is so constructed that 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.870
 it is double that means here in front 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 we only have the faces of the stones 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 that is very important always look what 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.200
 the beautiful face of the stone is and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.330
 it comes to the front and behind it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.370
 you bring in the stones the impression 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.170
 Just wanted to record from the garden 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.519
 Building is always a bit difficult 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 especially when you go to a height 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.489
 Here it is again but if you 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.829
 always wants to make a supporting wall 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.470
 double wall please quite important 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.140
 yes all right now he is coming 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.030
 my little friend never you know 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.400
 Actually they are very inconspicuous 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 so if you have family technology 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.489
 platinum when it was like now once 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:01.599
 then you can keep calm in the camera 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.569
 Above all, their beauty is wonderful 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.150
 makes each leaf more beautiful than one 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.660
 snow crystal more beautiful and they are there 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.250
 of course, an infinite number of species to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.060
 williams you have right now in the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.709
 good hand what makes server distinguishes 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.690
 just his red tips too 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 If you put the wall williams 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.269
 is like all tomatoes slowly growing 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.250
 dry resistant that's what he means 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.290
 needs almost no water and 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.299
 always looks very nice here 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.609
 you can breed the breed 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.560
 also do the same and this brut 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.250
 buds can be extra everywhere 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.769
 use 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.599
 she will but as it is the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.090
 perfect little litter 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.109
 that is more than pleasing so small and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.450
 already a litter have a different kind 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.200
 myself ever purely wanted him 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.239
 reinsetzen 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.470
 he does not know how to let her go 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.450
 Look fore them up 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.440
 So look like so the time already there even 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.079
 not just crushed around the one good one 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.650
 to give home only by a bit 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.190
 smart and forth there already benefited what you 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.549
 looks good 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.720
 that means i am a logic i am and so 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.020
 nice to him 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.690
 it would not be possible to do that 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.320
 okay do not stop it I do not do that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.299
 intentionally 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.980
 he will not be angry he will be you 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.690
 be grateful because he is made for it 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.970
 to fill these gaps 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.250
 Look and we have yes in the course 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.750
 Wall still more gaps down there 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.510
 Schetzschmar but we should squeeze 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.700
 now in and I have one more 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.650
 he brought special beauty 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.720
 I do not know because of the sedum types 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.410
 it comes very quickly when the itself 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.950
 they just look like new types 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.080
 do 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.610
 they are incredibly vital but me 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.850
 just wanted to bring this to the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.890
 Now with me balcony box here simply 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.140
 and to show what the beautiful and that 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.830
 Surprising is you just so 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.470
 it grows darker and it is still darker 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.050
 smooth and then beautiful when the sun 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.310
 on it seems it makes huge wants and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.169
 which stores the settlement then be 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.680
 have water next time such a leaf 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.680
 results 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.430
 take apart in the middle and 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.160
 moves together 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.290
 you can see that already that is the 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.390
 sun aloe vera plant to remind 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.890
 with this, what's it got even 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.860
 if they even drip out now 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.770
 that comes I have already on the pass 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.870
 on home plant so very much 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.850
 water that breaks him too 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.919
 to survive weeks of drought 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.870
 that's the beauty of it they are 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.900
 ideal wall residents respectively 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.970
 I always say these are the plants for 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.979
 people who are not much there and whether 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.060
 forget the plants or the idlers 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.210
 forget the say I 'm doing something 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.880
 beautiful total joy it buy 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.020
 for example, such a beautiful art and 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.550
 They are teachers with many others 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.870
 to lose things at once 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.120
 but I bought myself as a gasoline 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.040
 but now shows us how we do it 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.770
 Wrestling was a bit clover 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.750
 always ready the club a bit 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.940
 Sand because they do not necessarily like 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.760
 Waterlogged you would rather be trained 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.229
 soil then we take the plant 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.840
 how can you like to press together 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.210
 and the beautiful is also the litter has 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.210
 share power 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.710
 namely , we do not participate 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.150
 trudge other than the materials 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.169
 who can not handle the stuffing 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.650
 There's a very simple trick 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.240
 no and pantyhose take down old 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.080
 of course, an old down the feet 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 cut off 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.430
 tuck the sedum and then with the 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.020
 new and feet in the wall as 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.400
 funnel functional back of 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.139
 functions so those who are hard to do that 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.539
 so to plug it in can do that 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.610
 Shame on stockings very well 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.840
 you've crammed a lot and 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.949
 she just has the plants 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.949
 again hit the head 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.940
 is namely starts talking and I 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.620
 would have set loosely purely 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.030
 then it could have been that before her 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.560
 that they have rooted out 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.780
 But they are feasting now 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.280
 beautiful at home they have anyway 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.349
 a little cheeky times to degree 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.349
 I've done twice as 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.099
 Advice of the day 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.229
 the moment huge problems with the 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.099
 Buchholzzünsler terrible word already 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.870
 You can not do that 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.880
 get out last year for chaos 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.560
 taken care of and now the drama is real 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.389
 perfect we have to be consistent now 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.960
 Let's see if we have the tree in our box 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.820
 have and treat means that means 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.639
 Absorb suction and in case of huge damage 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.310
 I do not like to say it but fight 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.020
 that means chemical mace it stays with us 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.400
 no choice because that 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.870
 problem will not help either 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.460
 great because you only get them in certain 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.440
 we have to catch the stadium 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.060
 we can concentrate on doing it 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.759
 vacuum them in the industrial vacuum cleaner too 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.669
 The main thing we do is do something for them 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:52.610
 up to six generations and destroy 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.990
 the entire book holdings in rheinland 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.969
 Pfalz and Baden now please

 become active if heike boomgarden so 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:00.710
 afterwards it was said 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:04.030
 really what you like to have one more 

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.030
 few aces are planted
