00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
alright guys welcome to your fifth

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.010 
alright guys welcome to your fifth
computer<00:00:02.429> networking<00:00:02.820> tutorial<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:03.959> this

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
computer networking tutorial and in this

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.110 
computer networking tutorial and in this
video<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.710> want<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.279> go<00:00:05.400> over<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.730> different

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
video I want to go over the different

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.909 
video I want to go over the different
parts<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.839> network<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.410> let<00:00:07.589> me<00:00:07.680> go<00:00:07.799> ahead

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
parts of a network so let me go ahead

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.640 
parts of a network so let me go ahead
and<00:00:08.069> build<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.910> very<00:00:09.150> standard<00:00:09.900> or<00:00:10.110> typical

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
and build a very standard or typical

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190 
and build a very standard or typical
computer<00:00:11.040> network<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.610> now<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.660> obviously

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
computer network right now so obviously

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860 
computer network right now so obviously
of<00:00:13.500> course<00:00:13.790> can't<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> computer<00:00:15.420> network

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
of course can't have a computer network

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.260 
of course can't have a computer network
at<00:00:16.619> least<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.490> example<00:00:17.880> without<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
at least not in this example without a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.080 
at least not in this example without a
couple<00:00:18.570> pcs<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.500> these<00:00:19.920> pcs<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.939> be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
couple pcs and these pcs would just be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
couple pcs and these pcs would just be
you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.570> desktop<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.289> home<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.920> maybe<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you know your desktop at home or maybe a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.210 
you know your desktop at home or maybe a
laptop<00:00:23.820> if<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.810> may<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.439> um<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
laptop if you have one it may be um I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
laptop if you have one it may be um I
don't<00:00:26.340> know<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.730> school<00:00:27.060> maybe<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
don't know at school maybe you have a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.990 
don't know at school maybe you have a
server<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.550> guys<00:00:29.670> don't<00:00:29.849> know

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
server and if you guys don't know

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
server and if you guys don't know
exactly<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> server<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.369> going

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
exactly what a server is then I'm going

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.799 
exactly what a server is then I'm going
to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.669> talking<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.450> either<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to be talking about it either in the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
to be talking about it either in the
next<00:00:34.079> video<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> later<00:00:35.040> part<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
next video or the later part of this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.750 
next video or the later part of this
video<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.800> networks<00:00:37.800> usually<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.399> servers

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
video but networks usually have servers

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
video but networks usually have servers
in<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> let's<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.770> else<00:00:40.800> would

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
in them and let's see what else would

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.630 
in them and let's see what else would
you<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:42.000> school<00:00:42.300> printer

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
you have it I don't know school printer

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.799 
you have it I don't know school printer
that<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> computers<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.660> be

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that all the computers would be

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
that all the computers would be
connected<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.800> here's<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.190> printer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
connected to so here's your printer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
connected to so here's your printer
here's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.870> piece<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> paper<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.800> don't

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here's a little piece of paper I don't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
here's a little piece of paper I don't
know<00:00:50.910> why<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.840> writing<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
know why I put you know writing on that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.160 
know why I put you know writing on that
paper<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:53.940> hasn't<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.480> been<00:00:54.719> printed

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
paper when it hasn't even been printed

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
paper when it hasn't even been printed
yet<00:00:55.199> anyways<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.309> typically<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> printer

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
yet anyways you typically have a printer

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.170 
yet anyways you typically have a printer
and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.219> let's<00:00:59.609> say<00:00:59.760> network

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and then you have your let's say network

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
and then you have your let's say network
hardware<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> stuff<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
hardware and this is the stuff that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
hardware and this is the stuff that
people<00:01:02.340> typically<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.329> whenever<00:01:03.780> they

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
people typically think of whenever they

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
people typically think of whenever they
think<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.439> computer<00:01:04.949> networking<00:01:05.369> like

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
think of computer networking like

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
think of computer networking like
routers<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.700> your<00:01:08.700> modems<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.260> know

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
routers and your modems and you know

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.670 
routers and your modems and you know
switches<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.450> those<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.680> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
switches if you know what those are so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
switches if you know what those are so
these<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
these are all you know the kind of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.960 
these are all you know the kind of
networking<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> say

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
networking you know I don't want to say

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
networking you know I don't want to say
these<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:18.900> networking<00:01:19.409> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
these all have to do with networking but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
these all have to do with networking but
this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.340> typically<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.909> people<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this is typically what people think of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.679 
this is typically what people think of
these<00:01:22.110> pieces<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.479> these

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
these pieces right here now all of these

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.590 
these pieces right here now all of these
devices<00:01:25.140> from<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> laptops<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
devices from you know the laptops the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
devices from you know the laptops the
desktops<00:01:28.110> modems<00:01:28.950> printers<00:01:29.400> no<00:01:29.640> matter<00:01:29.880> what

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
desktops modems printers no matter what

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.200 
desktops modems printers no matter what
it<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> every<00:01:31.409> part<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.979> network<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.729> called<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it is every part of network is called a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.530 
it is every part of network is called a
node<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.619> devices<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.460> nodes<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
node all of these devices are nodes so

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
node all of these devices are nodes so
this<00:01:36.750> PC<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.650> server<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.700> router<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this PC this server this router is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.100 
this PC this server this router is
pretty<00:01:39.900> much<00:01:40.049> any<00:01:40.729> like<00:01:41.729> device<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
network that isn't the node so of course

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.420 
network that isn't the node so of course
we<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.570> devices<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.310> are

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
we have all these devices but what are

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
we have all these devices but what are
we<00:01:53.520> missing<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.090> computer<00:01:54.509> network<00:01:54.840> well

we missing in our computer network well
kind<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.640> makes<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> computer

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
kind of you know what makes a computer

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
kind of you know what makes a computer
network<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.840> computer<00:01:58.229> network<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> way<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
network a computer network a way to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.420 
network a computer network a way to
connect<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.420> devices<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.799> course<00:02:02.040> we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
connect these devices so of course we

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
connect these devices so of course we
connect<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.299> different<00:02:03.840> ways<00:02:04.049> maybe<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
connect them in different ways maybe a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
connect them in different ways maybe a
copper<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.130> wire<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.290> copper

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
copper or wire so you have some copper

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070 
copper or wire so you have some copper
wires<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.670> connected<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.539> servers

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
wires you know connected to your servers

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.610 
wires you know connected to your servers
and<00:02:10.349> maybe<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.660> some

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and maybe I don't know you have some

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.790 
and maybe I don't know you have some
let's<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.370> radio<00:02:14.790> waves<00:02:15.090> Wi-Fi<00:02:15.959> connected<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
let's say radio waves Wi-Fi connected to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.770 
let's say radio waves Wi-Fi connected to
your<00:02:16.920> printer<00:02:17.370> or<00:02:17.700> maybe<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.510> have

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
your printer or maybe you know you have

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
your printer or maybe you know you have
a<00:02:18.810> wireless<00:02:19.110> router<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.489> there's<00:02:20.760> Wi-Fi

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
a wireless router so there's Wi-Fi

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.770 
a wireless router so there's Wi-Fi
coming<00:02:21.690> off<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.819> basically<00:02:23.819> any<00:02:24.209> way<00:02:24.720> to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
coming off here so basically any way to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.199 
coming off here so basically any way to
connect<00:02:25.410> nodes<00:02:25.739> whether<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.640> copper<00:02:27.000> wire

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
connect nodes whether it's copper wire

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.250 
connect nodes whether it's copper wire
or<00:02:27.630> fiber<00:02:28.140> optics<00:02:28.709> or<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.849> Wi-Fi<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.660> of

that because of my handwriting so bad

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.070 
that because of my handwriting so bad
but<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:45.810> basically<00:02:46.160> what<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> very<00:02:47.519> basic

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
but that's basically what a very basic

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
heart of it is just two parts notes

heart of it is just two parts notes
which<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.850> pretty<00:02:54.120> much<00:02:54.239> your<00:02:54.450> devices<00:02:55.080> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
which are pretty much your devices and

remember<00:03:07.230> all<00:03:07.410> computer<00:03:07.980> networks<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.580> made

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
remember all computer networks are made

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.390 
remember all computer networks are made
up<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.030> two<00:03:09.299> parts<00:03:09.739> communications<00:03:10.739> media<00:03:11.160> and

up of two parts communications media and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.339 
up of two parts communications media and
they<00:03:11.970> provide<00:03:12.360> ways<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.780> transfer<00:03:13.200> data

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
they provide ways to transfer data

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.140 
they provide ways to transfer data
between<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.730> nodes<00:03:15.030> simple<00:03:15.959> enough
