 the kids will show their talent either 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.519
 with the aerosols on board a 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.429
 skateboard or undoing obstacles 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.799
 urban participants commented that 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.929
 in cuatitlÃ¡n install and still risky 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.389
 perform this type of sports and 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.630
 urban expressions for what they asked 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.950
 to the government more attention to this issue 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 they recognized that encounters like these 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.730
 They allow you to show that your passion is not 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.520
 a crime 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.520
 it is difficult because the authorities 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 on the walls 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.860
 the parks but they are a bit badly done 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 we prefer to skate on the street 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 but people see how bad 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.990
 in the street it seems pretty good 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:56.350
 because it is vital to know more about 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:58.500
 sports and think that is very 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.500

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:32.410
 in these spaces people are not what 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.410
 same to what they are used to 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.489
