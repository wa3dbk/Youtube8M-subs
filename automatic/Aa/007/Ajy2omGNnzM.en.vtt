00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
weeks on my part if I'm doing that I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
might put up two packs a day which would

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.110 
might put up two packs a day which would
be<00:03:24.480> quite<00:03:24.720> 20<00:03:25.140> videos<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.830> days<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
be quite 20 videos of days and so

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.449 
be quite 20 videos of days and so
another<00:03:27.480> pack<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.170> nothing<00:03:28.740> in<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.010> really

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
another pack with nothing in it really

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.540

put the shiny contracts up for 400 bin

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.030

because<00:03:33.350> they're<00:03:34.350> better<00:03:34.590> than<00:03:34.680> gold

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
because they're better than gold

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.710
