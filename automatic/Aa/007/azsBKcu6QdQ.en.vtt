00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 well me in any case it's great then 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.550
 first of all happy new year 1 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.639
 I hope you had a good 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.830
 new angle broke out and everything 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.450
 so today I present to you the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 wall second episode we'll say the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 little debate that I had everything so I 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.270
 you're warning right now it's not 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 I who was playing probably was not going 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.000
 sending of messages insulted nirina 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's not me who plays it's a guy 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.359
 against whom I played I was with schumi 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 we were quietly a little m 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.340
 moved and we fell into a welcome that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.129
 there was this player so this player I 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 found them great to do my 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.780
 video about campers what really 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.149
 so I told him nothing links 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.570
 himself he did that for the whole of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.730
 part 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 he did not stop camping we raged 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 like pigs with fumi because there 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.739
 it's already the second time it's 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.329
 done kill there is the same place we are going to the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910
 see after he's going to get killed I know 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 not how many times by beti then 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.329
 really the appetite of the cables in this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.280
 part in addition they had a good player 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.659
 in front 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 so it was really complicated to go 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.540
 to look for it because we knew where 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.950
 were they him but suddenly 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 we are witness to the others 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.860
 places and suddenly the other kill us 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.200
 easily so it was really boring 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.490
 there is obviously he is shooting he has 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 luck we did not come across a 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.480
 which posed camps called 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.870
 electric knives 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.830
 it's a chance but hey good when 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.390
 even remained to stay here for the entire 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.260
 part pretty much it goes mostly once 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.760
 it has changed a little bit 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.080
 of place he will go from meters plus 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.580
 far 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.030
 story to say that so this gameplay 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.280
 it's really good to represent the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.660
 the campers debate because there we can 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.160
 we really have an extreme case of trying 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.729
 a breakthrough but obviously it was not 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.040
 not efficient 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.619
 I wanted to get around it but not that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.820
 did not want so I said this gameplay 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.920
 it's really good to present 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.899
 because he but he will really go camping 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.700
 as a poor man I think he has to 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.200
 have the square ass in place of at the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.380
 end of the game because given the number 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.290
 of time where he stayed glued to two 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.360
 walls finally brief 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.790
 so I wondered why this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.340
 kind of player he plays be tibet this 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 that they are doing nothing he stays in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
 he shoots a corner when a guy comes 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.480
 in addition we were not successful 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.739
 we could not dislodge him so 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.060
 what can have some 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.010
 satisfactions must not know the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.430
 dropped 10 faction of having made a series 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.739
 blur in having chained several 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.480
 so why he played that the v6 is this 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.519
 that before we play maybe this 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 can not play it do it better 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.739
 q ratios but then he'll say yeah 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.510
 I did 18 4 because he did 18 4 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.670
 games in the game but valence as 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.250
 that because it is not impressive 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.680
 by the score and the way in which 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.720
 that he'll say yeah I did eighteen 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.880
 4.7 will fit in its form and that it 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
 is 4.16 + 1/2 it's four and a half 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 of ratios yeah that's great but when 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.920
 you see how he played that's it 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 no other handsome play we will not change 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.209
 still a little he is there betty tour 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.560
 Saint Paul was also not playing 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.840
 also the electrical project because that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.340
 works well the combination a knife 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 more bettie electric finally short 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.840
 so here I wanted to advice you on the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.660
 camp on its different forms there we have 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.150
 really a big campers a fixed sights 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.510
 for three quarters of the time but 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.130
 also on the camber more by zone me I 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.599
 personally finds that the cambe by 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.920
 zoned 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.900
 Well, it's not really camping because 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.930
 we say we take risks we stay 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.660
 in an area will be able to look for seniors 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.830
 me personally I do it finally I 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.020
 do not do it all the time but sometimes 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.060
 like jean-marc doing series i 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.910
 stayed in an area and I turn from 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.310
 random way for for not getting me 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.470
 spot by the enemies obviously and from 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.400
 So I'll finally it is as if 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.900
 the rocks 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.310
 I will not develop, but soon 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.810
 that I come across a game of killing then 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.269
 that's good series do not have 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.790
 not really say it's camping but 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.680
 at the time of the players like that I know 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.510
 I do not know what theirs are 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.439
 satisfaction 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.389
 how can they be forced to 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.180
 to play so maybe it's just 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.739
 players who do not foam too much 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.000
 go out who is watching the video is such 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.440
 they will say ah yeah that's it 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.330
 really proves the word game because if 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.270
 it is necessary it has rotten me 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.470
 bubble and play well quietly and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.139
 then we came across big 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.150
 campers like that frankly bravo the 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.160
 community a mini are not all like 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.570
 that but he came across a player like 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.240
 that if it still has not badly located the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.580
 balls so here I hope the video 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.289
 go a little bit to really see the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.750
 ridiculous of the situation that it serves to 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.789
 nothing to play to do that so that's it 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.780
 I am waiting for the site your opinion to say what 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.139
 what do you think 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.099
 if you tolerate if it annoys you then 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.259
 what can we do against 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.750
 players like that so here I wait 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.020
 your opinion in the meantime I wish you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.590
 to spend another pleasant year and to 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.300
 very soon 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.370
 come on hi everybody it's still 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.440
 me and yes I wanted to tell you too 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.039
 that if you like video do not hesitate to 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.960
 subscribe to and like all the 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.520
 world say it because it's true that 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.990
 it's still not that already 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.639
 pleasure and then yields especially as 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.830
 I'm not just doing videos on call of 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.860
 so if you like other games there 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.039
 chances are I fall I fall 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.539
 in your in your tastes so do not hesitate 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.009
 not to subscribe because the video 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.800
 she turns a little bit 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.180
 finally everything is relative but I have not 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.430
 a lot of subscribers so I can 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.659
 not forward you my videos in the 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.389
 continuity so I find it's a 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.669
 little damage otherwise you have the link 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.830
 since just now on my old 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.330
 video finally my old debate which 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.909
 was dealing with pensions then at 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.250
 score this trek by name where I speak is a 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.620
 little bit of getting them and all that 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.120
 was going this time I leave you and at 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.340
 very soon for the next video that 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.340
 will talk about call of duty statistics
