play<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.699> music<00:00:21.029> starts<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> can

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
play and the music starts and as you can

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.279 
play and the music starts and as you can
see<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.850> coincides<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.420> pulses<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
see it just coincides the pulses on the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.310 
see it just coincides the pulses on the
song<00:00:26.150> with<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> screen<00:00:28.080> but

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
song with what you see on the screen but

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.150 
song with what you see on the screen but
then<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:28.859> move<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> mouse<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
then I can also move the mouse and the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.830 
then I can also move the mouse and the
ink<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> screen<00:00:36.570> follows<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.440> movements

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
ink on the screen follows my movements

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.490 
ink on the screen follows my movements
and<00:00:40.489> I<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:43.020> hard

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and I know that it's a little bit hard

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
and I know that it's a little bit hard
to<00:00:43.590> hear<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.520> talking<00:00:44.760> over<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to hear because I'm talking over the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.260 
to hear because I'm talking over the
music<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.980> website<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:48.090> actually

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
music but the website is actually

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.450 
music but the website is actually
painting<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.890> girl<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.280> singing<00:00:50.520> about

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
painting what the girl is singing about

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
if I just leave as on it goes by itself

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:06.350 
if I just leave as on it goes by itself
but<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.129> fun<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> play<00:01:05.180> one<00:01:06.180> more

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and when I see it I see a little bit

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.130 
and when I see it I see a little bit
more<00:02:10.110> yellowish<00:02:10.860> tones<00:02:11.510> on

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
colors kind of fade out so that's one

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.000 
colors kind of fade out so that's one
thing<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:24.090> keep<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.450> mind<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.840> then

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
thing that you can keep in mind and then

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.970 
thing that you can keep in mind and then

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
time we can test how good the camera is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280 
time we can test how good the camera is
during<00:02:46.080> daylight<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.820> perhaps<00:02:47.820> test<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
during daylight and perhaps test the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.590 
during daylight and perhaps test the
camera<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.760> has<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.330> flash

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
camera on the back that has the flash

camera on the back that has the flash
feature<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.280> any<00:02:53.430> good<00:02:54.170> so<00:02:55.170> I'll

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
