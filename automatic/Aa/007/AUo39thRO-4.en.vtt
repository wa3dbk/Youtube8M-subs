00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that you can read this was before I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.960 
that you can read this was before I
started<00:01:11.220> using<00:01:12.200> Mac<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
started using Mac because at the time

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
started using Mac because at the time
the<00:01:15.600> only<00:01:15.840> experience<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.159> was

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the only experience I really had was

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
the only experience I really had was
with<00:01:17.759> Windows<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> ultimately<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
with Windows so ultimately down here you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
with Windows so ultimately down here you
have<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> plus<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> minus<00:01:23.790> button

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
have a plus and you have a minus button

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
have a plus and you have a minus button
this<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.110> zoom<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.000> if<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this these are two zoom and if you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.859 
this these are two zoom and if you
right-click<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.939> search<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> document

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
right-click you can search the document

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.660 
right-click you can search the document
for<00:01:31.079> something<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.829> don't<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> guess<00:01:32.460> I'll

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for something I don't know I guess I'll

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
for something I don't know I guess I'll
search<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.060> music<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.540> find<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.259> of

search for music and it will find all of

search for music and it will find all of
the<00:01:38.159> music<00:01:39.000> labels<00:01:39.509> within<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> document

the music labels within this document

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
the music labels within this document
and<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.229> close<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.530> there

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and then you can close it there

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
and then you can close it there
you<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.330> display<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.350> pages<00:01:46.650> instead

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you can display it as two pages instead

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can display it as two pages instead
of<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.759> scroll<00:01:51.119> through<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of one and you can scroll through the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.859 
of one and you can scroll through the
pages<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.790> available<00:01:54.979> buttons<00:01:55.979> here

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
pages with the available buttons here

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
pages with the available buttons here
which<00:01:57.869> essentially<00:01:58.860> would<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.220> nice<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
which essentially would be nice on a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399 
which essentially would be nice on a
tablet<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.140> do

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
tablet because all you would have to do

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.960 
tablet because all you would have to do
is<00:02:01.619> put<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.070> thumbs<00:02:02.570> onto<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.690> buttons<00:02:04.970> if

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
is put your thumbs onto these buttons if

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.059 
is put your thumbs onto these buttons if
you<00:02:06.360> display<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.289> page<00:02:07.649> you're

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you display it as one page you're

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.340 
you display it as one page you're
basically<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.239> page<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> time

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
basically going one page at a time

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.250 
basically going one page at a time
exact<00:02:10.739> same<00:02:11.039> system<00:02:11.660> scroll<00:02:12.660> wheel<00:02:12.900> doesn't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
exact same system scroll wheel doesn't

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.729 
exact same system scroll wheel doesn't
work<00:02:13.709> for<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.340> let<00:02:15.000> me<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.360> note<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.739> so

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
work for this let me just note that so

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.130 
work for this let me just note that so
you<00:02:17.160> might<00:02:17.400> want<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> use<00:02:18.060> two<00:02:18.269> continuous<00:02:18.900> if

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you might want to use two continuous if

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100 
you might want to use two continuous if
you're<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> PC<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.569> can<00:02:21.750> use<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you're on a PC because you can use the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.570 
you're on a PC because you can use the
scroll<00:02:22.410> wheel<00:02:22.650> with<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:24.950> now<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.010> other

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840 
rotate info bookmarks and close file
bookmarks<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.970> basically<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.380> some<00:02:38.100> documents

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
bookmarks is basically in some documents

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.400 
bookmarks is basically in some documents
based<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> way<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.230> they're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
based on the way that they're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.250 
based on the way that they're
constructed<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:41.160> headers<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:43.080> can

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
constructed with headers in that you can

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.630 
constructed with headers in that you can
actually<00:02:45.440> skip<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.769> certain<00:02:47.100> parts<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.519> a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
actually skip to certain parts of a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.720 
actually skip to certain parts of a
document<00:02:48.180> using<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.430> really

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
document using this and this is really

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.620 
document using this and this is really
nice<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:52.190> don't<00:02:53.190> think<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.549> had<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
nice I don't think they had this in the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.610 
nice I don't think they had this in the
release<00:02:54.959> preview<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.570> new<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
release preview so this is new to the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.569 
release preview so this is new to the
app<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.410> skip<00:03:01.769> around<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.519> is

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
app and you can skip around and this is

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.289 
app and you can skip around and this is
really<00:03:03.269> convenient<00:03:04.820> there<00:03:05.820> doesn't<00:03:06.239> seem

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
really convenient there doesn't seem

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.539 
really convenient there doesn't seem
however<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.380> something<00:03:08.100> where<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.340> can

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
however to be something where you can

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.830 
however to be something where you can
search<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.450> particular<00:03:09.690> page<00:03:11.450> let<00:03:12.450> me<00:03:12.600> just

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
search for a particular page let me just

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020 
search for a particular page let me just
try<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> find<00:03:13.560> again<00:03:13.950> let's<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.519> if<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.820> can

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
try to find again let's see if I can

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.880 
try to find again let's see if I can
find<00:03:15.269> page<00:03:15.829> 49

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.930 

ultimately<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.010> would<00:03:23.220> probably<00:03:23.460> have<00:03:23.790> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
ultimately I would probably have to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.990 
ultimately I would probably have to
click<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.710> but<00:03:25.710> I<00:03:25.740> think<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:26.400> document

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
click this but I think that's document

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.930 
click this but I think that's document
specific<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.410> here<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.710> can<00:03:29.010> get<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.340> 49

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
specific you see here I can get the 49

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.630 
specific you see here I can get the 49
but<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.400> math

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
but let's have if I was in a math

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.880 
but let's have if I was in a math
document<00:03:33.360> or<00:03:33.810> something<00:03:34.200> with<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.500> lot<00:03:34.740> of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
document or something with a lot of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.430 
document or something with a lot of
numbers<00:03:35.490> maybe<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.570> wouldn't<00:03:36.900> be<00:03:36.990> able<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.290> get

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
numbers maybe I wouldn't be able to get

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.830 
numbers maybe I wouldn't be able to get
this<00:03:37.650> result<00:03:38.040> as<00:03:38.280> quickly

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.850 

so<00:03:43.380> now<00:03:43.530> basically<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.270> decide<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.110> close

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
so now basically if you decide to close

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.270 
so now basically if you decide to close
this<00:03:47.160> file<00:03:47.550> more<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.870> close<00:03:49.110> file<00:03:49.500> you're

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
this file more and close file you're

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.520 
this file more and close file you're
going<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.520> be<00:03:50.640> brought<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:53.239> reader<00:03:54.530> screen

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
going to be brought to a reader screen

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
going to be brought to a reader screen
you<00:03:56.220> can't<00:03:56.489> right<00:03:56.760> click<00:03:57.030> here<00:03:57.330> but<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.599> will

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720

version<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.260> file<00:04:25.680> manager<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.450> a

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
version of a file manager this is a

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.540 
version of a file manager this is a
clean<00:04:27.840> install<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.560> don't<00:04:28.800> have<00:04:28.860> any<00:04:29.130> files

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
clean install so I don't have any files

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.390 
clean install so I don't have any files
in<00:04:29.850> here<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.360> just<00:04:31.290> drag<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.800> one<00:04:32.010> off<00:04:32.160> from

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
in here I just drag this one off from

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.170 
in here I just drag this one off from
from<00:04:32.910> an<00:04:33.090> external<00:04:33.600> hard<00:04:33.840> disk<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:35.820> put<00:04:36.120> it

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
from an external hard disk and I put it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.260 
from an external hard disk and I put it
on<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.450> desktop<00:04:36.840> for<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:38.160> tutorial<00:04:38.460> so

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
on the desktop for this tutorial so

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.480 
on the desktop for this tutorial so
ultimately<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.260> would<00:04:40.440> open<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.010> like<00:04:41.190> this

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
ultimately you would open it like this

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.980 
ultimately you would open it like this
and<00:04:42.410> voila<00:04:43.410> we're<00:04:44.250> back<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.060> document<00:04:46.880> so

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
and voila we're back to the document so

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.370 
and voila we're back to the document so
I've<00:04:48.990> showed<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:50.160> document<00:04:51.380> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
I've showed you this document the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.529 
I've showed you this document the
drawback<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.640> can't<00:04:53.940> have<00:04:54.240> multiple

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
drawback is that you can't have multiple

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.670 
drawback is that you can't have multiple
documents<00:04:55.470> open<00:04:55.620> at<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.220> same<00:04:56.430> time<00:04:57.289> which<00:04:58.289> is

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
documents open at the same time which is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.490 
documents open at the same time which is
kind<00:04:58.950> of<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.250> hassle<00:04:59.580> because<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:01.140> need<00:05:01.289> to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
kind of a hassle because if you need to

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.580 
kind of a hassle because if you need to
compare<00:05:01.890> two<00:05:02.340> PDF<00:05:02.910> documents<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:04.110> know<00:05:04.320> I've

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
compare two PDF documents I know I've

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.860 
compare two PDF documents I know I've
