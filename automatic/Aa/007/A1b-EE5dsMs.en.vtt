00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
boost we will complete the mission let's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.939 
boost we will complete the mission let's
do<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> okay<00:00:24.750> let's<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.109> over<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.859> I'm

a little red flag above my head and that
means<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.710> Quest<00:00:29.460> Mode<00:00:31.250> all

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
means that we are in Quest Mode all

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520 
means that we are in Quest Mode all
right<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> says<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.390> ability<00:00:34.170> boost

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
right so it says to use ability boost

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.010 
right so it says to use ability boost
let's<00:00:34.890> read<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.280> properly<00:00:35.719> crystal<00:00:36.719> Drive

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
let's read this properly crystal Drive

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.740 
let's read this properly crystal Drive
activate<00:00:37.290> ability<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.670> oh<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.300> these<00:00:39.570> are

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
activate ability to you oh so these are

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.850 
activate ability to you oh so these are
the<00:00:39.780> steps<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.590> follow<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the steps that you need to follow the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
the steps that you need to follow the
first<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.430> attack<00:00:42.120> people<00:00:42.510> with

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
first one is attack people with

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
first one is attack people with
abilities<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.860> abilities<00:00:44.250> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
abilities if you use your abilities your

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
abilities if you use your abilities your
resonance<00:00:45.090> power<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.989> number<00:00:46.710> two<00:00:46.739> if

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
resonance power will go up number two if

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
resonance power will go up number two if
your<00:00:47.550> residence<00:00:47.910> power<00:00:48.120> reaches<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> certain

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
your residence power reaches a certain

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
your residence power reaches a certain
level<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.250> activate<00:00:50.640> crystal

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
level then you will activate crystal

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
level then you will activate crystal
drive<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.989> part<00:00:52.260> number<00:00:52.469> three<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
drive and then part number three is that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.939 
drive and then part number three is that
while<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.360> crystal<00:00:54.840> drive<00:00:55.079> mode<00:00:55.440> your

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
while you are in crystal drive mode your

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.040 
while you are in crystal drive mode your
abilities<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.670> become<00:00:56.940> ability<00:00:57.510> boosted

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
abilities will become ability boosted

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.139 
abilities will become ability boosted
and<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:59.010> need<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.640> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and that's all we really need to know so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.229 
and that's all we really need to know so
let's<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.600> ahead<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.399> use<00:01:02.399> our<00:01:02.609> abilities<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
let's go ahead and use our abilities to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.190 
let's go ahead and use our abilities to
hit<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.989> people<00:01:04.549> like<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.170> yes<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.960> one<00:01:09.960> more

hit some people like so yes and one more

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
hit some people like so yes and one more
time<00:01:10.880> okay<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> 30<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.220> last<00:01:14.400> time

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
time okay so up to 30 i think last time

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.990 
time okay so up to 30 i think last time
we<00:01:14.880> had<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.950> 150<00:01:16.950> before<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
we had to get to about 150 before the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.899 
we had to get to about 150 before the
ability<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.680> crystal<00:01:19.979> drive<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.369> activated

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
ability the crystal drive was activated

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
ability the crystal drive was activated
so<00:01:21.920> we're<00:01:22.920> already<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.490> 60<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:25.520> what

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so we're already at about 60 now what

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.899 
so we're already at about 60 now what
Bosh<00:01:27.360> yes<00:01:27.930> okay<00:01:28.500> got<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:30.500> okay<00:01:31.500> come<00:01:31.829> on

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
Bosh yes okay got it and okay come on

Bosh yes okay got it and okay come on
yes<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:34.500> favor<00:01:34.710> aight<00:01:34.979> aight<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.700> looks

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
yes and a favor aight aight so looks

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
yes and a favor aight aight so looks
like<00:01:36.180> we're<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.570> halfway<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
like we're about halfway there to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.910 
like we're about halfway there to
charging<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.640> gauge<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
charging our gauge you do have to do it

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
charging our gauge you do have to do it
quite<00:01:41.130> fast<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> resonance<00:01:42.540> gauge

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
quite fast because the resonance gauge

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.249 
quite fast because the resonance gauge
will<00:01:42.990> slowly<00:01:43.590> deplete<00:01:44.780> let's<00:01:45.780> oh<00:01:45.990> he's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
will slowly deplete let's oh he's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.609 
will slowly deplete let's oh he's
running<00:01:46.470> away<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.890> run<00:01:46.920> away<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:48.439> am<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
running away don't run away I am the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.270 
running away don't run away I am the
Goblin<00:01:49.829> Slayer<00:01:52.579> ok<00:01:54.530> 124<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.890> still<00:01:56.130> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
Goblin Slayer ok 124 it's still not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.140 
Goblin Slayer ok 124 it's still not
enough

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:08.070 

okay<00:02:01.960> okay<00:02:04.480> okay<00:02:05.480> we<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.260> now<00:02:06.410> activate<00:02:06.620> boost

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
okay okay okay we can now activate boost

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.080 
okay okay okay we can now activate boost
crystal<00:02:09.080> drive<00:02:09.290> has<00:02:09.619> been<00:02:09.649> activated<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.790> now

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
crystal drive has been activated so now

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.720 
crystal drive has been activated so now
if<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.630> use<00:02:11.810> my<00:02:12.020> abilities<00:02:12.470> they<00:02:13.460> will<00:02:13.610> be

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
if I use my abilities they will be

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.550 
if I use my abilities they will be
ability<00:02:14.300> boosted<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.020> I'm<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> go<00:02:15.530> over

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
