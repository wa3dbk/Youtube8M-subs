custom piece of somebody everyday it's
changing<00:00:18.080> by<00:00:18.200> a<00:00:18.230> pencil<00:00:18.710> line<00:00:18.890> or<00:00:19.130> a<00:00:19.160> fraction

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
changing by a pencil line or a fraction

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.820 
changing by a pencil line or a fraction
or<00:00:19.940> or<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.630> little<00:00:20.900> bit<00:00:21.050> or<00:00:21.200> maybe<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.500> next<00:00:21.650> day

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
or or a little bit or maybe the next day

or or a little bit or maybe the next day
it<00:00:21.920> changes<00:00:22.220> by<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.370> few<00:00:22.610> inches<00:00:22.790> but<00:00:23.720> just

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
it changes by a few inches but just

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.110 
it changes by a few inches but just
having<00:00:24.200> that<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.980> keep<00:00:25.220> like<00:00:25.550> design

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
having that and to keep like design

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.880 
having that and to keep like design
design<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.810> keep<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.110> pushing<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.680> pushing

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
design and keep it pushing and pushing

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.700 
design and keep it pushing and pushing
forward<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:29.210> still<00:00:29.480> kind<00:00:29.750> of<00:00:29.869> gravitating

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
forward it's still kind of gravitating

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.139 
forward it's still kind of gravitating
around<00:00:30.800> it's<00:00:31.220> always<00:00:31.460> spinning<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.059> just

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
around it's always spinning and just

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.500 
around it's always spinning and just
grab<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.419> little<00:00:32.599> pieces

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.750 

it's<00:00:36.410> good<00:00:36.650> it's<00:00:36.860> bad<00:00:37.040> let's<00:00:37.340> make<00:00:37.490> it<00:00:37.520> better

designs<00:00:48.890> what's<00:00:49.130> important<00:00:52.600> maybe<00:00:53.600> like

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
designs what's important maybe like

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.750 
designs what's important maybe like
shaping<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:54.920> have<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:55.220> design<00:00:55.550> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
shaping it's like I have that design and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.500 
shaping it's like I have that design and
I<00:00:55.790> just<00:00:56.000> do<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:58.280> more<00:00:58.430> I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:58.580> when<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.450> do

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
I just do it the more I think when I do

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.570 
I just do it the more I think when I do
my<00:00:59.720> board<00:01:00.020> sometimes<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:01.010> get<00:01:01.690> stopped<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.930> by

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
my board sometimes I get stopped up by

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.860 
my board sometimes I get stopped up by
like<00:01:04.580> thinking<00:01:04.910> too<00:01:05.120> much<00:01:05.270> in<00:01:05.449> between<00:01:05.540> each

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
like thinking too much in between each

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.190 
like thinking too much in between each
step<00:01:06.170> if<00:01:06.890> i<00:01:06.979> have<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.370> concept<00:01:07.960> like<00:01:08.960> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
step if i have the concept like the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.380 
step if i have the concept like the
whole<00:01:09.350> design<00:01:09.890> ready<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.340> go<00:01:10.490> i<00:01:10.520> just<00:01:10.880> try<00:01:11.330> and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
whole design ready to go i just try and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.109 
whole design ready to go i just try and
let<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.690> go<00:01:11.840> let<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.140> flow<00:01:12.640> gonna<00:01:13.640> stop<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
let it go let it flow gonna stop the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.280 
let it go let it flow gonna stop the
thinking<00:01:14.360> have<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.840> already<00:01:15.110> thought<00:01:15.259> out

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
thinking have it already thought out

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.440 
thinking have it already thought out
before<00:01:15.740> i<00:01:15.770> start<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.060> roll<00:01:17.270> right

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
before i start and just roll right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:28.260 
before i start and just roll right
through<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:17.960> then<00:01:18.050> it's<00:01:18.170> done

board that does that it might be okay
but<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.679> can<00:02:09.830> deal<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.700> some<00:02:11.690> board<00:02:12.200> just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
but if you can deal with some board just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.460 
but if you can deal with some board just
based<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:13.459> your<00:02:13.490> previous<00:02:14.060> boards<00:02:14.480> it's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
based on all your previous boards it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.130 
based on all your previous boards it's
just<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.920> gets<00:02:15.950> closer<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.490> closer<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.140> just

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
just it gets closer and closer to just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.510 
just it gets closer and closer to just
being<00:02:18.349> what<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.980> want

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.339 

shaping's<00:02:25.520> taken<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.910> toll<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.599> my<00:02:26.900> body<00:02:26.930> that's

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
shaping's taken a toll on my body that's

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.460 
shaping's taken a toll on my body that's
the<00:02:27.560> theory<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.040> grill<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.910> uh

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the theory it's a grill but uh

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.229 
the theory it's a grill but uh
everything's<00:02:30.470> are<00:02:30.620> grueling<00:02:31.010> grueling<00:02:31.970> way

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
everything's are grueling grueling way

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.550 
everything's are grueling grueling way
to<00:02:32.300> make<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.660> living<00:02:32.959> maybe<00:02:33.110> at<00:02:33.470> least

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
to make a living maybe at least

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.350 
to make a living maybe at least
everything<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:37.000> right<00:02:38.000> now<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> think

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
everything that I know right now I think

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.229 
everything that I know right now I think
I'll<00:02:38.600> keep<00:02:38.780> shaping<00:02:39.140> probably<00:02:39.739> till<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.489> die<00:02:40.790> I

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
I'll keep shaping probably till I die I

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.900 
I'll keep shaping probably till I die I
want<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.050> be<00:02:42.230> shaping<00:02:42.770> boards<00:02:43.100> till<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> day<00:02:43.880> I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
want to be shaping boards till the day I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.850 
want to be shaping boards till the day I
don't<00:02:44.120> wake<00:02:44.239> up<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.780> then<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.080> day<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.739> I'm
