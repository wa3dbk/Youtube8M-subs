 let's put the chip and here what 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.300
 happens is that I promote with 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 it consists in that it puts you in your same number 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
 that is, you have a number on your chip 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 previous purchases the phone you move the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.390
 line to this new chip which is a 5.0 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.430
 there you can see there we have it is a chip 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.400
 from telcel and this v 5.0 and then they move 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.819
 here the line and then what is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 they enter your balance that you had and apart 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.060
 of the 600 pesos the truth I saw it very 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.159
 practical let's do the installation 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.439
 of the chip that really is very very 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.939
 simple and we have it we are going to put the 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.680
 battery and we will learn it quickly 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.260
 for you to see 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.670
 as it turns on as a light we're going to put 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.450
 the back cover 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.270
 and we are going to make the plastic removed 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.520
 the truth is a phone that if not 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.170
 want to spend a lot maybe it can vary 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.690
 this price for that I do not like to give 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.849
 the prices in these videos because then 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.940
 there are claims not from hears rivers you 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.510
 you said you told me that this one so much 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.910
 that here and there and then not 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.830
 nor do they find it then good I for 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.900
 I never like to look bad with 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.000
 you see that on the back stage 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.930
 there we have it and well let's do the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.930
 Turn on the computer so they can see how 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.879
 turns on 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.939
 well at least this I'm trying 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.750
 to do bring your radio back so that 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:42.010
 read mp3 big keys and this color then 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.379
 type wine red red metallic and 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.019
 Well now what I detect is from 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.930
 that you can see the missed calls there 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.700
 on the first screen which I was 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.219
 makes it very handy many phones 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.920
 they do but good and bring your watch outside 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:02.130
 here when you close your lid it appears 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 a watch I'm trying to light 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:11.060
 but he could not do it 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.560
 the ignition of the good equipment more or 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.480
 less around here goes like this 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.489
 Maybe he needs a battery right now 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.650
 let's load it remember it whenever 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.710

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.660
