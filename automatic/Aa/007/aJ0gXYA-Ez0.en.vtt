let's<00:01:48.289> put<00:01:48.409> at<00:01:48.560> four<00:01:49.420> spread<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.630> for<00:01:51.049> size<00:01:51.829> is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
let's put at four spread is for size is

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.490 
let's put at four spread is for size is
four<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.729> make<00:01:53.179> sure<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.450> contour<00:01:53.929> is<00:01:54.140> set<00:01:54.350> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
four and make sure the contour is set to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.700 
four and make sure the contour is set to
this<00:01:54.590> second<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.280> right<00:01:55.460> here<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.229> turn<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
this second one right here and turn this

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.490 
this second one right here and turn this
on<00:01:58.359> next<00:01:59.359> is<00:01:59.450> we're<00:01:59.630> going<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.840> add<00:02:00.020> an<00:02:00.229> inner

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
on next is we're going to add an inner

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.950 
on next is we're going to add an inner
shadow<00:02:00.890> basically<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.000> exact<00:02:02.270> same<00:02:02.479> options

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
shadow basically the exact same options

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.739 
shadow basically the exact same options
almost<00:02:03.320> yo<00:02:03.649> pacity<00:02:04.130> fifteen<00:02:04.520> percent<00:02:04.850> angle

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
ninety percent distance is five keep the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.550 
ninety percent distance is five keep the
choke<00:02:09.440> at<00:02:09.590> zero<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.100> set<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.970> size<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.660> five

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
choke at zero and set the size to five

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.470 
choke at zero and set the size to five
next<00:02:13.310> we're<00:02:13.430> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.670> add<00:02:13.730> an<00:02:14.090> inner<00:02:14.360> glow

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
on ok so we have a basic water droplet

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.380 
on ok so we have a basic water droplet
right<00:03:16.560> over<00:03:16.770> here<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.160> looks<00:03:17.400> pretty<00:03:17.760> nice<00:03:17.970> now

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
right over here it looks pretty nice now

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.300 
right over here it looks pretty nice now
depending<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.260> size<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.770> your<00:03:19.800> water

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
depending on the size of your water

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.130 
depending on the size of your water
droplet<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> settings<00:03:21.390> will<00:03:21.600> vary<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
droplet the settings will vary and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.990 
droplet the settings will vary and
obviously<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.220> your<00:03:23.340> personal<00:03:23.700> preference

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
obviously on your personal preference

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.310 
obviously on your personal preference
you<00:03:24.270> can<00:03:24.330> change<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> settings<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.200> your

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
you can change the settings to your

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.230 
you can change the settings to your
liking<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:26.280> there's<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.610> thing<00:03:26.670> that's<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
liking but there's one thing that's a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.930 
liking but there's one thing that's a
little<00:03:27.540> bit<00:03:27.660> off<00:03:28.400> when<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.490> have<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> water

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
little bit off when you have a water

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.910 
little bit off when you have a water
droplet<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.660> light<00:03:30.870> gets<00:03:31.080> distorted<00:03:31.590> so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
droplet the light gets distorted so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.220 
droplet the light gets distorted so
whatever<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.490> behind<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.080> see

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
whatever is behind it as you can see

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.650 
whatever is behind it as you can see
this<00:03:34.380> tip<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> will<00:03:35.730> be<00:03:35.910> distorted<00:03:36.300> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
this tip of the a will be distorted so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.600 
this tip of the a will be distorted so
here's<00:03:36.990> how<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.440> do<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.770> we're<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.520> to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
here's how we can do that we're going to

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
which will create it as a selection just

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.150 
which will create it as a selection just
like<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:49.380> what<00:03:49.560> we<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.830> do<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.130> can

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
like this and then what we can do we can

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.520 
like this and then what we can do we can
go<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.459> filter<00:03:51.060> distort<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:53.190> ripple<00:03:53.850> and

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
go to filter distort and then ripple and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.290 
go to filter distort and then ripple and
then<00:03:55.530> adjust<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> settings<00:03:56.400> accordingly<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
then adjust the settings accordingly to

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.910 
then adjust the settings accordingly to
your<00:03:57.330> personal<00:03:57.660> preference<00:03:58.290> now<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.830> can

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
your personal preference now as you can

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.710 
your personal preference now as you can
see<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.400> zoom<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.790> here<00:03:59.820> we<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.630> an

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
see if we zoom in here we have an

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.090 
see if we zoom in here we have an
example<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.830> look<00:04:01.920> like

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
example of what it's going to look like

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.920 
example of what it's going to look like
so<00:04:02.700> we're<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:02.880> looking<00:04:03.300> for<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.480> little<00:04:03.540> bit

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
so we're just looking for a little bit

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.640 
so we're just looking for a little bit
of<00:04:04.080> distortion<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.550> adjust<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.500> angle

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
of distortion so we can adjust the angle

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.530 
of distortion so we can adjust the angle
the<00:04:08.220> amount<00:04:08.489> just<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.120> I'm<00:04:09.270> gonna<00:04:09.360> put

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
the amount just like this I'm gonna put

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.199 
the amount just like this I'm gonna put
it<00:04:09.600> around<00:04:09.690> nine<00:04:10.050> hundred<00:04:10.530> percent<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.640> click

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it around nine hundred percent and click

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.690 
it around nine hundred percent and click
OK<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.410> deselect<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.520> little

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
OK and then deselect so we have a little

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.430 
OK and then deselect so we have a little
bit<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:14.940> distortion<00:04:15.360> which<00:04:15.720> kind<00:04:16.020> of<00:04:16.080> gives<00:04:16.260> a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
bit of distortion which kind of gives a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.250 
bit of distortion which kind of gives a
little<00:04:16.560> bit<00:04:16.680> more<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:18.090> realistic<00:04:18.480> feel<00:04:18.989> to

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
little bit more of a realistic feel to

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.420 
little bit more of a realistic feel to
it<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.880> obviously<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.390> add<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:22.020> many

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
it and obviously you can add as many

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.100 
it and obviously you can add as many
water<00:04:23.430> droplets<00:04:23.940> as<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.419> change<00:04:24.900> the
