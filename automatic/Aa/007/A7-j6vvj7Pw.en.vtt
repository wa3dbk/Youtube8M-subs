00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
decided to do arms and I basically did a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
decided to do arms and I basically did a
routine<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.230> hadn't<00:00:16.680> done<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.100> years<00:00:17.550> but

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
routine that I hadn't done for years but

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.000 
routine that I hadn't done for years but
I<00:00:18.180> figured<00:00:18.570> I'd<00:00:18.720> show<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:18.990> guys<00:00:19.289> since<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I figured I'd show you guys since when I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
I figured I'd show you guys since when I
was<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.640> routine<00:00:20.820> twice<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> week<00:00:21.750> back

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
was doing this routine twice a week back

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990 
was doing this routine twice a week back
in<00:00:22.170> high<00:00:22.320> school<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> time

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
in high school was actually the time

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
in high school was actually the time
period<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> grew<00:00:24.630> most<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.350> mass<00:00:25.590> on

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
period where I grew most of my mass on

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.609 
period where I grew most of my mass on
my<00:00:25.980> arms<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> start<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:27.990> I'd<00:00:28.230> always<00:00:28.380> do

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
my arms so to start off I'd always do

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
my arms so to start off I'd always do
wrote<00:00:28.920> press<00:00:29.279> downs<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.420> basically<00:00:30.779> just

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
wrote press downs and I'm basically just

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
wrote press downs and I'm basically just
warming<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.980> doing<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.430> high<00:00:32.640> reps

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
warming up I'm doing really high reps

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.610 
warming up I'm doing really high reps
I'm<00:00:33.210> still<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> failure<00:00:34.050> since<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I'm still going to failure since this is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
I'm still going to failure since this is
the<00:00:34.649> last<00:00:34.770> set<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> did<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.630> otherwise

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the last set that I did but otherwise

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.709 
the last set that I did but otherwise
it's<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.500> basically<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.070> warm-up<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it's just basically a warm-up but then I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.400 
it's just basically a warm-up but then I
get<00:00:40.020> too<00:00:40.260> close<00:00:40.770> grip<00:00:41.280> bench<00:00:41.309> press<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
get too close grip bench press and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.360 
get too close grip bench press and
obviously<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> i'm<00:00:44.070> using<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
obviously you can see that i'm using a
really<00:00:44.610> thick<00:00:44.879> bar<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:46.079> since<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.649> gym

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
isn't a particular reason why i tend to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
isn't a particular reason why i tend to
use<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.300> grip<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.110> overall<00:01:04.409> I'd<00:01:04.710> say<00:01:04.739> unless

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
use that grip but overall I'd say unless

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you've had plenty of experience with it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
you've had plenty of experience with it
I'd<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> regular<00:01:08.220> grip<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I'd go with just a regular grip just to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
I'd go with just a regular grip just to
be<00:01:09.270> safe<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.229> next<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.770> got<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> my

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
main focus when doing these is just to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
main focus when doing these is just to
make<00:01:16.110> sure<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.560> forearms<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> only

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
make sure that my forearms are the only

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
make sure that my forearms are the only
things<00:01:17.909> moving<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:19.380> locking<00:01:19.650> my

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
things moving and really locking my

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
things moving and really locking my
elbows<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.490> place<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.119> letting<00:01:21.390> them

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
elbows into place and not letting them

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
elbows into place and not letting them
flare<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:22.650> usually<00:01:22.979> tend<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.640> an

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
flare out I also usually tend to use an

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210 
flare out I also usually tend to use an
easy<00:01:24.060> bar<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.020> exercise<00:01:25.350> when<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
easy bar when I do this exercise when I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
easy bar when I do this exercise when I
use<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> straight<00:01:26.790> bar<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> hurts<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> wrist<00:01:27.869> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
use a straight bar it hurts my wrist but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
use a straight bar it hurts my wrist but
if<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> gym<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.310> I'll<00:01:29.579> still<00:01:29.820> go

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
if that's all the gym has I'll still go

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
if that's all the gym has I'll still go
for<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> option<00:01:32.250> i'm

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for it but if I have the option i'm

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200
