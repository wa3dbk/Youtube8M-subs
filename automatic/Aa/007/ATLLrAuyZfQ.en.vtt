00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello to a small it is now about how to last no secret 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.479
 I did not miss it 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.200
 Skin of Skills for you thank you again at this point I have now 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.269
 multiple days 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.119
 intensively tested 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.039
 and around 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.220
 the security is freedom pulling the owner Tudor 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.019
 about so i have pronounced everything right 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.640
 but I do not want one either 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.939
 in general Jesse this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.679
 Skins make from this side at m there are also in very many 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.920
 different versions that they still part different 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.830
 This is why it is so and then I just started with the 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.840
 Front side 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.120
 which is almost not just about the complete front of this metal 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.440
 with a lock but what I think not bad at all 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.010
 Berlin the association is free Berlin 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.690
 Exposure meter is still free up here which I find cool 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.090
 and around 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.100
 he just looks absolutely 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.880
 cool from the bachelor is still complete use warns that means it adjusts itself 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.970
 Perfect 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.149
 and die 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.000
 yes who now agree not to say here first 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 Percent the back 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 I know a little bit surprised that it does not go that often because if 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.300
 you always look 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 Here for the customers is so a bit 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 if you can or you can 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.159
 and it does not work 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.300
 I thought they were still looking for the trains but not at all 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.700
 but in the right time is still completely protected 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.470
 the connections are free 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.390
 Rome 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.460
 South Baden 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 is also because the volume keys are here reachable 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.870
 The first concert is completely protected 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.940
 there comes 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.200
 no scratches on it, but just stop our pages 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.869
 Sims still unprotected it's just not a whole case, it's just your own 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 Move in the team 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.950
 but still 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.119
 it has a high protection factor it protects really totally protects 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.409
 Contract attorney 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.770
 the fear is different than I expected 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.979
 that is to say 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.560
 she is not as skinny as one knows from this display slides then 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.650
 Here's just from that look online that's important and that comes through 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.919
 even no vision at all, that is to say 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.729
 When I put the foil on it, it was really very easy for me 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.059
 has laps scheduled is why crossed out if he still in which 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.759
 Drops were simply smoothed out again 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.609
 it is really easy 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.399
 and around 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 yes, like a bull, Iris Hayek 's Dr 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.310
 Captain is growing again 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.729
 the SPD can wait all know what I mean it still obscured 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.869
 Not much has happened to me 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.119
 but one 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:49.939
 she is absolutely horny confirming it will be a total eye-catcher and that 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.569
 best is yet to come »you certainly can not have a dead with them 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.550
 You also have to specify percent of work website 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.569
 if they also separate Daimler's description with it 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.139
 and if he does then 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.069
 and having learned that, he still gets around this cool compared with 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.180
 and how about that the animals in 1 on the Criterium on each other 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.109
 it is 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.499
 to 10 absolutely cool that is also available in many different 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.429
 versions 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.220
 but I like that already 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.159
 really good 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.469
 I think many there is nothing to say the only criticisms are just that 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.949
 salt 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.239
 here would not have been so well protected 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.059
 but it does not have to be that way either 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.899
 and then that 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.219
 these countries here 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.469
 to apply the wall a bit heavier everything really can not be stopped 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.739
 Doing these times differently are always a bit 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.709
 Flatz shelves until now mean 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.099
 so this was a bit complicated but really worth it 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.219
 until 10 o'clock here it is also a bit oblique if you look closely 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.869
 but the light itself is not bad 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:53.239
 I've also tested percent times so today to dismiss the slide one 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.239
 It needs a bit of tingling because this does not aim well 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.609
 but you know them again 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.749
 and van Hattum 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:04.170
 no gays you notice the l where the film points to it 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.040
 a bit cleaner even both 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 Here comes the Swiss still on it 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.459
 yes but you also get the slide off you can even think of it 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.459
 second time - if one percent 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.659
 two or three of the connoisseur 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.799
 then you can just stop once again 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.750
 Leveque life and the other then I think that's possible 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.580
 this gene Posselt 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.689
 Seniors or the stick will cost you ten euros 9 euros 99 euros can from games for you 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.249
 easy to order 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.840
 is very very fast 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.620
 and pretty 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.080
 but there is no end to it, it was not to say 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.969
 but who knows when should I say 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.740
 this 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.669
 makes sense this game makes the iPod and much thicker it means 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 a bit thicker that's really not too much you can Pröll 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.759
 long 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.870
 I want to scratch I know that I should shoot 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.259
 Alaba by 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.749
 will the iPad 2 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.940
 such heights already complicated that is this 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.419
 which is not 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.279
 Wemding to get it 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.299
 that works but you can tell he's there 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.309
 has become a little thicker 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.309
 but everything still fits 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.999
 it is not a problem 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.359
 So I think only really good product won Sidar is a real eye-catcher 

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:30.080
 In the report was often addressed in school what that is because that too 

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.490
 Put a dog or iPod Touch choice 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.270
 Planner does not recognize so well now 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.860
 but the fans definitely have really good product you can just out 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.629
 Games 4you go 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:43.300
 and you just have a lot of different Ankum 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.909
 I also could and again 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.139
 a card even if we win then yes I can at this point again 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.239
 bent the percent 1000 subscribers the Wu Wei is still on 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:56.509
 there could not be any skins or teenagers 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.659
 al this may have been it now 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.819
 really nice scenes we like very much good workmanship 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:04.930
 and Dr 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.860
 I want to have some unsightly things a lot of fun
