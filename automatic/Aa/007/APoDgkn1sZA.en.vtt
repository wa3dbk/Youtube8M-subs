maybe I could translate a bit of it and
figure<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> plot<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
figure out what the plot of it is I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
figure out what the plot of it is I
haven't<00:01:01.949> learned<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> character

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
