00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
cabinets and the whole idea of this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.900 
cabinets and the whole idea of this
project<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:10.930> kind<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.290> use<00:01:11.770> what's<00:01:12.729> out

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
project is to kind of use what's out

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.389 
project is to kind of use what's out
there<00:01:12.940> something<00:01:13.930> old<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.770> you<00:01:14.860> don't<00:01:15.040> end<00:01:15.190> up

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
there something old so you don't end up

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.400 
there something old so you don't end up
paying<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.790> lot<00:01:15.910> of<00:01:15.940> money<00:01:16.210> of<00:01:16.869> course<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.229> can

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
paying a lot of money of course you can

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.770 
paying a lot of money of course you can
buy<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:17.710> cabinets<00:01:18.160> that<00:01:18.479> Lowe's<00:01:19.479> or<00:01:19.720> Home

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
Depot or whatever but the idea is to use

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160 
Depot or whatever but the idea is to use
something<00:01:24.220> that's<00:01:24.400> already<00:01:24.790> around<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.659> just

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
something that's already around and just

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.140 
something that's already around and just
give<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.500> second<00:01:26.830> life<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.970> go<00:01:28.090> to

you use the the wall cabinets and it's
going<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.510> be<00:01:46.690> too<00:01:47.049> narrow<00:01:47.380> you're<00:01:47.890> not<00:01:48.010> going

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
going to be too narrow you're not going

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.399 
going to be too narrow you're not going
to<00:01:48.189> have<00:01:48.310> any<00:01:48.460> room<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:49.780> anything<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.320> your

to have any room to put anything on your
desk

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.929 

next<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:57.960> you're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.159> you're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
next thing you're going to do is you're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
next thing you're going to do is you're
going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> cut<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.110> basis<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.130> cabinet's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
going to cut the basis off the cabinet's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.770 
going to cut the basis off the cabinet's
the<00:02:03.390> standard<00:02:03.719> def<00:02:03.899> type<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.860> 30<00:02:05.189> inches

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
the standard def type is about 30 inches

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.639 
the standard def type is about 30 inches
so<00:02:07.220> cabinets<00:02:08.269> tend<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.390> run<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:10.200> least<00:02:10.380> 6

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so cabinets tend to run at least 6

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.930 
so cabinets tend to run at least 6
inches<00:02:10.800> taller<00:02:11.190> than<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.790> you're<00:02:11.910> going

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
inches taller than that so you're going

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.479 
inches taller than that so you're going
to<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.239> cut<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.810> base<00:02:13.230> part<00:02:13.680> so

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
to want to cut off that base part so

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.400 
to want to cut off that base part so
that<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.880> desk<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:15.810> appropriate

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that your desk will be at appropriate

that your desk will be at appropriate
height<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:18.269> do<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> used<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.470> jig<00:02:19.860> saw<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
height to do that I used a jig saw you

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.940 
height to do that I used a jig saw you
could<00:02:21.060> also<00:02:21.209> use<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> circular<00:02:22.140> saw<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:22.800> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
could also use a circular saw if you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.020 
could also use a circular saw if you
have<00:02:23.130> one

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
after you're done cutting the base of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960 
after you're done cutting the base of
the<00:02:34.410> cabinet<00:02:34.590> off<00:02:35.010> you're<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.820> want<00:02:35.940> to

the cabinet off you're going to want to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.540 
the cabinet off you're going to want to
prep<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.390> finishing<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.950> mine<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.130> had

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
prep it for finishing for mine I had

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.280 
prep it for finishing for mine I had
this<00:02:38.820> weird<00:02:39.330> laminate<00:02:40.610> like<00:02:41.930> covering<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.140> had

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
this weird laminate like covering I had

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.710 
this weird laminate like covering I had
to<00:02:43.380> peel<00:02:43.560> off<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.520> after<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.820> did<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.150> primed

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to peel off so after I did that I primed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
to peel off so after I did that I primed
it<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> painted<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.370> also<00:02:47.520> used

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it and then I painted it and I also used

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.610 
it and then I painted it and I also used
any<00:02:48.180> some<00:02:48.570> wood<00:02:48.720> filler<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.230> fill<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.500> any

cracks that existed

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870 
cracks that existed
I<00:02:51.900> used<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.560> foam<00:02:52.740> roller<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.490> paint<00:02:53.700> on

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
I used a foam roller to put the paint on

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
I used a foam roller to put the paint on
you<00:02:54.120> could<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> paint<00:02:55.380> brush<00:02:55.500> or<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.100> foam

you could use a paint brush or a foam
roller<00:02:56.990> whatever<00:02:57.990> you're<00:02:58.140> comfortable<00:02:58.320> with

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.870 

to<00:03:11.750> make<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.110> top<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.650> cabinet<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.370> went<00:03:13.670> to

plywood<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:17.840> made<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.470> oak<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:19.130> wanted

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
plywood that's made out of oak I wanted

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.550 
plywood that's made out of oak I wanted
something<00:03:20.300> nice<00:03:20.480> here<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.410> wouldn't

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
something nice here so that it wouldn't

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
something nice here so that it wouldn't
warp<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.100> me<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.490> wanted<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.300> be<00:03:23.420> nice<00:03:23.570> and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
warp on me I wanted it to be nice and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.570 
warp on me I wanted it to be nice and
solid<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:26.170> went<00:03:27.170> there<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.440> they<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:28.370> have

solid so I went there and they they have
a<00:03:28.610> good<00:03:28.940> deal<00:03:29.090> where<00:03:29.360> they'll<00:03:29.510> cut<00:03:29.960> it<00:03:29.990> down

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
a good deal where they'll cut it down

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.350 
a good deal where they'll cut it down
for<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.040> you're<00:03:31.550> going<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.850> cut<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.240> right

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
for you so you're going to cut it right

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.360 
for you so you're going to cut it right
to<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.020> width<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.940> width<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.450> desk<00:03:35.690> and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.280 
to the width the width of the desk and
luckily<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.460> can<00:03:37.790> use<00:03:38.030> one<00:03:38.300> sheet<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.930> just

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
luckily you can use one sheet and just

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.430 
luckily you can use one sheet and just
have<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.500> cut<00:03:39.830> in<00:03:39.950> half<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:42.200> will

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
have it cut in half and that will

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.900 
have it cut in half and that will
provide<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:43.010> enough<00:03:43.310> for<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.880> whole<00:03:44.140> desk

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
provide you enough for the whole desk

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.390 
provide you enough for the whole desk
depending<00:03:46.910> how<00:03:47.230> how<00:03:48.230> long<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.650> need<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.160> be

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
depending how how long you need it to be

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.240 
depending how how long you need it to be
and<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:51.350> get<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.100> desktop<00:03:52.640> ready<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.480> use

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
and to get the desktop ready for use

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.530 
and to get the desktop ready for use
again<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.790> primed<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.910> painted

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
again I I primed it and then I painted

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
again I I primed it and then I painted
it<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.770> actually<00:04:00.950> used<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.430> brush<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.970> time

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
it and I actually used a brush this time

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.180 
it and I actually used a brush this time
and<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:02.870> turned<00:04:03.230> out<00:04:03.350> really<00:04:03.500> nice<00:04:03.770> and<00:04:03.830> I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
and it it turned out really nice and I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.070 
and it it turned out really nice and I
made<00:04:04.580> sure<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.790> let<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.150> dry<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.420> long<00:04:05.840> time

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
made sure to let it dry a long time

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.199 
made sure to let it dry a long time
before<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.620> actually<00:04:06.800> put<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> on<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.850> started

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
before I actually put it on and started

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.040 
before I actually put it on and started
using<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.690> desk

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.270 

the<00:04:13.050> last<00:04:13.230> thing<00:04:13.380> you'll<00:04:13.500> do<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.830> put<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
the last thing you'll do is put all the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.729 
the last thing you'll do is put all the
final<00:04:14.670> touches<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.570> put<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.290> top<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.650> your

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
final touches on and put the top of your

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
final touches on and put the top of your
desk<00:04:16.980> on<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:20.370> do<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:21.209> lay<00:04:21.510> out<00:04:21.540> your

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
desk on it to do that you lay out your

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.540 
desk on it to do that you lay out your
plywood<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.410> top<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.980> you're<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.310> want

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
plywood on top and you're going to want

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.190 
plywood on top and you're going to want
to<00:04:23.610> go<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:24.000> underneath<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:24.720> some<00:04:24.750> screws

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
to go in underneath with some screws

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.190 
to go in underneath with some screws
that<00:04:25.350> are<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:26.490> shorter<00:04:27.180> than<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.570> plywood

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
that are just shorter than the plywood

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.930 
that are just shorter than the plywood
so<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.920> doesn't<00:04:29.100> come<00:04:29.430> through<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.760> top

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
so that doesn't come through the top

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.770 
so that doesn't come through the top
you're<00:04:30.120> going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.270> want<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> be<00:04:30.570> really

you're going to want to be really
careful<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.230> watch<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:32.240> you're<00:04:33.240> also

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420
