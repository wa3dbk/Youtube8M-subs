00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.810
 it is 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 Celebrity Special Smith feeds Eggemann Ellen tents 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.149
 and he tells us what the core competence of your company 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.850
 yes we are dealing with 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.850
 Awnings leads Lehmann caravan 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.390
 SPOX faces FÃ¼rth also campers 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.450
 The awning will be assembled once and should be ready for the next 30 years 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.510
 30 years is a long time what is the advantage for the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.910
 the customer when he tents 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 the advantage for the customer we have special materials 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.710
 Percentage from Switzerland in the games will be the Turbo Matra year 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.950
 Thermo Matreier he says in principle already the word 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.290
 I isolated the custom no additional isolation I have one 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.910
 Stifling water if percent and rifles shade temperatures can do that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.870
 no one else 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.960
 competitors 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.310
 Percent guarantee 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 also not nice double effect I would say 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.760
 because the philosophy of their company 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.040
 Percent yes 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.740
 Customer Satisfaction is Robust Probost the Commandment That is the philosophy below 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.340
 That's why we have been on the market for so long 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.370
 There are many tents manufacturers 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 in the world around the border and afterwards to its competitors 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.300
 we always do a little bit more 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.470
 and not necessarily for the percent necessarily for the last price yet 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.990
 he emphasizes emphasize here he who buys white here he becomes 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.220
 not ripped off explaining the value for money 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.650
 absolutely synonymous with new products that are legally protected but the addiction 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.360
 Per cent but not to blow up the frame 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.990
 if we use the advantage of our so-called here on the old that it 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.680
 necessarily from the many companies do that too if they have a patent on one 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.620
 Bazaar Modern many patents 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.430
 because then the surprise effect for the customer if so in or if 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.449
 a piece of paper is where you do not expect the general customer 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.289
 if it's their products 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.549
 So the customer does not expect that if you have nothing new 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.339
 like this year have like a folk hero 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.429
 Percent constructed with conservatory that did not exist before 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.079
 what is normal in the future what can one still in the next years 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.440
 expect it to ignore innovation or special highlights 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.019
 always because of that 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.359
 and that the space in the middle of the campsite is always very high 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.799
 why not a two-story past what perhaps still about the caravan 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.269
 protrudes 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.690
 that does not have to be two feet of fish five meters high that would be 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.480
 probably so much but if I have dormitories above the caravan 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.209
 would have 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.230
 with a tasks percent before twelve 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.719
 Rattling adventures over sports will be in the sleeping area via the caravan 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.929
 that's too high 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:04.309
 Things I can imagine
