really got a P atoms that bond with
hydrogen<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.479> electrons<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
hydrogen we're like electrons and that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.399 
hydrogen we're like electrons and that
is<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.430> happens<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:49.460> hydrogen<00:01:50.460> bond

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
is what happens in all hydrogen bond

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.920 
is what happens in all hydrogen bond
you<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.649> your<00:01:52.799> cohesion<00:01:53.399> cuz<00:01:54.030> water<00:01:54.270> bonds<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you got your cohesion cuz water bonds to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
you got your cohesion cuz water bonds to
itself<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.979> adhesion<00:01:56.520> there's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
itself you got your adhesion there's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
itself you got your adhesion there's
water<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.630> something<00:01:58.200> else<00:01:58.380> together<00:01:58.950> they

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
water but something else together they

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.420 
water but something else together they
move<00:01:59.939> water<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.960> tree<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> our<00:02:01.950> travels

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
move water up a tree so that our travels

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.469 
move water up a tree so that our travels
all<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> different<00:02:03.930> colored<00:02:04.229> leaves

all up to the different colored leaves
now<00:02:06.479> ice<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:07.140> float<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.829> floats<00:02:08.340> over<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
now ice can float it floats over the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
now ice can float it floats over the
water<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.629> protects<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> coke<00:02:10.860> I

and<00:03:05.290> muscles<00:03:05.800> support<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.880> whole<00:03:07.060> immune

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
and muscles support the whole immune

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.570 
and muscles support the whole immune
system<00:03:07.900> transfer<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.010> nutrients<00:03:09.430> throughout

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
system transfer the nutrients throughout

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.550 
system transfer the nutrients throughout
the<00:03:09.640> blood<00:03:09.940> they<00:03:10.510> can't<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.900> cooked<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.440> they

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
the blood they can't be cooked and they

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.930 
the blood they can't be cooked and they
won't<00:03:11.770> work<00:03:11.980> because<00:03:12.160> we<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.520> structure

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
won't work because we know structure

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000 
won't work because we know structure
fits<00:03:13.120> what<00:03:13.330> they<00:03:13.510> do<00:03:13.890> carbohydrates<00:03:14.890> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
fits what they do carbohydrates and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.650 
fits what they do carbohydrates and
lipids<00:03:15.100> yeah<00:03:15.550> they<00:03:15.820> do<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.060> same<00:03:16.210> thing

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
lipids yeah they do the same thing

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.240 
lipids yeah they do the same thing
they<00:03:16.810> both<00:03:16.990> are<00:03:17.020> used<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.800> battery<00:03:18.130> energy

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
they both are used for battery energy

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.790 
they both are used for battery energy
carbs<00:03:19.209> are<00:03:19.330> commonly<00:03:19.750> referred<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.080> as<00:03:20.260> simple

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
carbs are commonly referred to as simple

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.110 
carbs are commonly referred to as simple
sugars<00:03:21.190> they<00:03:21.340> are<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.700> things<00:03:22.000> like

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
sugars they are little things like

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.170 
sugars they are little things like
chitin<00:03:22.510> starts<00:03:22.990> so<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> low<00:03:24.010> send<00:03:24.340> glycogen

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
chitin starts so you low send glycogen

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.760 
chitin starts so you low send glycogen
all<00:03:25.690> these<00:03:25.900> things<00:03:26.260> come<00:03:26.470> with<00:03:26.590> little

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
all these things come with little

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.440 
all these things come with little
itty-bitty<00:03:27.130> things<00:03:27.640> like<00:03:27.820> glucose<00:03:28.270> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
itty-bitty things like glucose and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.530 
itty-bitty things like glucose and
fructose<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:30.610> lipids<00:03:30.910> are<00:03:31.030> cool<00:03:31.270> they're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
fructose that lipids are cool they're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.300 
fructose that lipids are cool they're
hip<00:03:31.720> they<00:03:32.290> can<00:03:32.470> store<00:03:32.620> twice<00:03:32.770> as<00:03:32.920> much<00:03:33.010> energy

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
hip they can store twice as much energy

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.760 
hip they can store twice as much energy
as<00:03:33.580> carbs<00:03:33.970> kid<00:03:34.360> but<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.080> them<00:03:35.230> wet<00:03:35.410> cuz

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
as carbs kid but don't get them wet cuz

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.410 
as carbs kid but don't get them wet cuz
they<00:03:35.890> don't<00:03:36.010> like<00:03:36.220> water<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.850> property<00:03:37.330> is

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
they don't like water this property is

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.320 
they don't like water this property is
known<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.840> hydrophobia<00:03:38.940> lipids<00:03:39.940> are<00:03:40.090> things

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
known as hydrophobia lipids are things

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330 
known as hydrophobia lipids are things
like<00:03:40.480> saturated<00:03:40.750> unsaturated<00:03:41.140> fats<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340

his name is story but he's not what do
you<00:03:48.190> think<00:03:48.430> he'll<00:03:48.910> finish<00:03:49.180> cholesterol

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
you think he'll finish cholesterol

products but in all seriousness I think

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.800 
products but in all seriousness I think
this<00:04:14.140> stuff<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.820> this<00:04:16.000> material<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.720> we

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
this stuff that this material that we

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.490 
this stuff that this material that we
are<00:04:16.930> learning<00:04:17.109> here<00:04:17.730> should<00:04:18.730> be<00:04:18.910> known<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:20.290> all
