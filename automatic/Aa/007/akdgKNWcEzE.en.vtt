 long procedure how do you see the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.940
 sir ingredients please give me a few 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.830
 we already have four stockings

 breasts inside a processor is 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.260
 important bone and a clear

 enough to have no flavor 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.910
 we need more let's make one towards cases 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.910
 and party add perfect pepper 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.939
 and it has to be perfect but that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.710
 magic is going to stick in our hands 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.840
 then with probability water or also 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.430
 with 23 to water preference area for 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.560
 that we do not stick our hands and we can 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.450
 manipulating the profession is wrong 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.070
 you're up is an egg pasta what 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.200
 you just saw I say chicken egg 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.030
 with egg white then we need 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.610
 a big sheet of aluminum that we're going to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.130
 spray with oil if you do not have this 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.200
 sprayer put some oil and a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.759
 telo with the hand and its current then 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.039
 Wet my hands 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.720
 I take a portion more or less as the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.130
 half of this because this reaches us 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.050
 for the rolls I can not make a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.880
 so big roll then I'm going to do it 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.519
 in two wet parts with your hands and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.789
 I start to extend and you could the 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.789
 rice 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.900
 exactly but it is very important 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.519
 sir we extend it delgadito 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.920
 delgadito delgadito because if it does not remain 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.080
 fat but that wide and to any 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.090
 reason is that big does not have to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.880
 have by mouth and then I extend 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.040
 well that seemed to help me 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.450
 to make the sauce the sauce is only technical 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.130
 witch you know how to add everything 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.970
 in this low broth then I'm going 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.760
 saying that what he sees 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.770
 here we have light soy sauce very 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.370
 important to add to you lemon 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.440
 lemon juice please 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.210
 then orange juice if this is the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.190
 sauce that I found a sauce that 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.540
 brought with holly but the sauce that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.860
 you have at home or they can be 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.290
 green chilitos so you do not go to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.810
 buy the green lito remnant sauce 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.880
 with everything and seed so that it stings if you 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.440
 put add a tablespoon of oil 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.480
 peanut or it can also be 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.220
 sesame seeds then we are ready to 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.380
 fill our your hundreds or what 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.360
 this will do is put some 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.959
 cucumber what pines are in strips 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.080
 thin more or less like that after I go to 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.670
 add carrot equal of that same 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.220
 do not exaggerate with the filling 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.100
 because then a roll is born you have 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.850
 that be very thin our roll and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.450
 then we are going to put cream cheese for 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 a knife 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.750

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.610
 I roll up tight and I give way so that 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.610
