00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.990
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.519
 you have the world already 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.140
 from a stable pair 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.540
 we have land 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.030
 these crust is the most successful moment 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.400
 for winter sowing, we have already removed 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.900
 several clips and under the winter for strength 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.050
 if anyone is interested please 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 look we shot a role for under winter 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.010
 sowing asters 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.849
 there are their subtleties about under winter 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.630
 sowing 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.190
 other plants find if it is someone 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.590
 this topic interests 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.540
 and now we 'll talk about under the winter 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.980
 passive of those plants that 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.410
 breed self- sown but they are sown 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.859
 maybe on the places where we are with you 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.739
 and we want them we can 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.140
 sow where they will be with us 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.590
 grow in a permanent place here is one of 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.469
 such plants is echinacea 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.500
 see what she has enough 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:11.450
 decorative even here are the seeds 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.270
 cones with such little bodies are enough 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.510
 tough and here they are beautiful with us 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.590
 matures if here and so went to take 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.750
 this cone that turns Look 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 what wonderful seeds here and 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.070
 imagine that we have with you right now 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.259
 plus one degree somewhere let's imagine that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.159
 you and I are generally very cold weather 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.960
 and you did not advance the grooves and when 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.939
 podzimny sowing because you have to do 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.130
 grooves in advance to imagine that you 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.140
 not made grooves and sow under zil 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.180
 really want you know how you can 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.180
 make it very easy here right here 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.070
 There is a small such area, I clean 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.560
 just for the sake of experiment you here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 show here just grew up and go these 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.360
 seeds here in this way with 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 underground sowing 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.530
 density can be made somewhat larger 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.550
 than with ordinary spring sowing because 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.920
 that weak seeds do not survive occurs 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.170
 such a natural selection and it is very 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.130
 even well the strongest only 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.460
 plant remain which give us the most 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.540
 beautiful decorative shrubs in lush 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.450
 I have been multiplied like this 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.609
 same two bush echinacea this medicinal 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.530
 plant and here I still want to plant 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.409
 more 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.140
 let me have her whole in a row 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.180
 to not only admire well and do with 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.799
 her some drugs 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.959
 here to the guest on sowed everything to them now 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.769
 see what I'm doing taking this one 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.159
 the land is called this in this case the garden 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.469
 wonders of firm fart I have a very long time this 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.920
 I use the earth very much I like it 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:02.159
 never let down good quality 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.470
 once one does not rot and the seeds are very 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.139
 well come in because it's land 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.290
 loose caking never and 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.480
 quite nutritious that's why i have her 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.579
 Now they use it because we are 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.989
 also talking to you at the underground sow 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.480
 frozen ground 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.639
 and so here are the seeds of some of our 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.700
 own garden land to fall asleep 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.859
 it is impossible and we take here this purchase not 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.900
 so here 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.729
 we fall asleep these seeds here we have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.030
 in the winter 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:41.069
 will sleep through the whole winter calmly and in the spring 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.970
 but shoots will appear here 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.329
 then I am from this town all the most 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 good shoots turn on permanent 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.989
 place and maybe one bush after all, even 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.849
 and will leave at the end of the earth a personal bed by 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.699
 named strawberry bed will be decorated 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.400

 Echinacea is possible in this way 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.470
