00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.579 

this<00:00:07.809> is<00:00:07.990> my<00:00:08.139> old<00:00:08.349> arm<00:00:08.620> PC<00:00:09.220> power<00:00:10.179> supply<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.440> I

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:11.589 
this is my old arm PC power supply and I

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.739 
this is my old arm PC power supply and I
built<00:00:11.860> it<00:00:11.980> into<00:00:12.160> this<00:00:12.429> case<00:00:12.730> it's<00:00:12.999> a<00:00:13.150> case<00:00:13.450> up

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:13.749 
built it into this case it's a case up

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.600 
built it into this case it's a case up
from<00:00:14.289> an<00:00:14.379> old<00:00:14.530> inverter

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
from an old inverter

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.630 
from an old inverter
and<00:00:16.090> I<00:00:16.150> just<00:00:16.299> put<00:00:16.510> four<00:00:17.140> binding<00:00:18.010> posts<00:00:18.400> on<00:00:18.520> the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
and I just put four binding posts on the

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.980 
and I just put four binding posts on the
front<00:00:18.880> here<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.800> one<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.690> had<00:00:22.690> it<00:00:22.780> for<00:00:22.900> about

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
front here this one I had it for about

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.720 
front here this one I had it for about
three<00:00:23.410> or<00:00:23.500> four<00:00:23.650> years<00:00:23.680> but<00:00:24.130> it's<00:00:24.279> just<00:00:24.460> blown

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
three or four years but it's just blown

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.650 
three or four years but it's just blown
up<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:26.380> did<00:00:26.619> try<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.830> fix<00:00:27.160> it<00:00:27.430> but<00:00:27.670> I<00:00:27.820> I<00:00:28.150> can't

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
up and I did try to fix it but I I can't

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.530 
up and I did try to fix it but I I can't
work<00:00:28.840> out<00:00:29.020> what's<00:00:29.200> wrong<00:00:29.410> with<00:00:29.529> it<00:00:29.680> so<00:00:30.220> I<00:00:30.610> have

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
work out what's wrong with it so I have

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.290 
work out what's wrong with it so I have
to<00:00:31.630> build<00:00:31.779> another<00:00:31.990> one<00:00:32.349> but<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:37.000> one<00:00:37.150> that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
to build another one but the one that

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.040 
to build another one but the one that
was<00:00:37.450> inside<00:00:37.870> there<00:00:38.290> it<00:00:38.710> was<00:00:38.920> only<00:00:39.480> 1.5<00:00:40.480> amps<00:00:40.750> on

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
was inside there it was only 1.5 amps on

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.160 
was inside there it was only 1.5 amps on
the<00:00:41.079> 12<00:00:41.170> volt<00:00:41.620> rail<00:00:41.680> anyway<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.690> think<00:00:44.110> it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
the 12 volt rail anyway and I think it

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.660 
the 12 volt rail anyway and I think it
was<00:00:44.260> 11<00:00:44.470> amps<00:00:44.770> on<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:44.980> thorry<00:00:45.250> volt

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
was 11 amps on the thorry volt

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.080 
was 11 amps on the thorry volt
and<00:00:45.820> 11<00:00:46.180> amps<00:00:46.329> on<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.510> 3.3<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.460> was<00:00:48.609> one<00:00:48.879> for

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
and 11 amps on the 3.3 it was one for

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.069 
and 11 amps on the 3.3 it was one for
Mafia's<00:00:49.680> 1998<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:50.710> think<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.629> said<00:00:52.840> on<00:00:52.960> the

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
Mafia's 1998 I think it said on the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.869 
Mafia's 1998 I think it said on the
board<00:00:53.289> so<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.820> done<00:00:55.059> well<00:00:55.269> mmm<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.789> was

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
board so I that's done well mmm that was

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.430 
board so I that's done well mmm that was
just<00:00:58.030> one<00:00:58.210> like<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.660> I've<00:00:58.960> got<00:00:59.109> quite<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.350> few

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
just one like this I've got quite a few

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.619 
just one like this I've got quite a few
of<00:00:59.739> these<00:00:59.829> what<00:01:00.100> I've<00:01:00.190> pulled<00:01:00.399> out<00:01:00.760> of

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
of these what I've pulled out of

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.830 
of these what I've pulled out of
computers<00:01:04.800> this<00:01:05.800> one<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.970> 11<00:01:07.420> amps<00:01:07.600> on

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
computers this one here is 11 amps on

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.250 
computers this one here is 11 amps on
the<00:01:07.870> 5<00:01:08.140> volt<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:09.040> 3.5<00:01:09.790> amps<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.540> 12<00:01:10.630> I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
the 5 volt and 3.5 amps on the 12 I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.649 
the 5 volt and 3.5 amps on the 12 I
don't<00:01:12.040> want<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.220> use<00:01:12.370> this<00:01:12.550> one<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:12.940> may<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.210> may

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
don't want to use this one I may I may

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.530 
don't want to use this one I may I may
do<00:01:13.720> at<00:01:14.350> some<00:01:14.590> point<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.940> mind<00:01:16.120> only<00:01:16.240> use

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
do at some point that the mind only use

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.690 
do at some point that the mind only use
this<00:01:16.659> one<00:01:16.900> here<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:18.100> one's<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.400> little<00:01:18.490> bit

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
this one here this one's a little bit

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.650 
this one here this one's a little bit
newer<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.610> actually<00:01:21.880> got<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.390> SATA

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
newer it's actually got a SATA

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.130 
newer it's actually got a SATA
connectors<00:01:23.200> on<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.500> one<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.870> quite<00:01:26.080> a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
connectors on this one so it's quite a

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.950 
connectors on this one so it's quite a
bit<00:01:26.350> newer<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:27.910> one<00:01:28.150> has<00:01:28.510> got<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.720> lot

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
bit newer but this one has got a lot

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.760 
bit newer but this one has got a lot
more<00:01:29.790> power<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.240> 12<00:01:31.600> volt<00:01:31.660> rail<00:01:31.930> we've<00:01:32.560> got

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
more power on the 12 volt rail we've got

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.810 
more power on the 12 volt rail we've got
20<00:01:33.550> amps<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:33.970> 12<00:01:34.060> volt<00:01:34.390> rail<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.640> 22<00:01:36.640> on

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
20 amps on the 12 volt rail and 22 on

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.160 
20 amps on the 12 volt rail and 22 on
the<00:01:36.910> 5<00:01:37.150> volt<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.720> 20<00:01:38.470> on<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.590> 3.3<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.050> this

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
the 5 volt and 20 on the 3.3 so and this

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.610 
the 5 volt and 20 on the 3.3 so and this
is<00:01:41.260> still<00:01:41.440> quite<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> small<00:01:41.980> one<00:01:42.330> but<00:01:43.330> uh<00:01:43.590> yep

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
is still quite a small one but uh yep

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.690 
is still quite a small one but uh yep
that's<00:01:44.800> not<00:01:44.980> too<00:01:45.130> bad

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
that's not too bad

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.350 
that's not too bad
be<00:01:46.600> pretty<00:01:46.900> good<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.950> says<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.310> here<00:01:48.580> Mac<00:01:48.940> total

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
be pretty good it says on here Mac total

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.400 
be pretty good it says on here Mac total
power<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.720> 270<00:01:50.620> watts<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:53.140> should<00:01:53.320> be

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
power is 270 watts so that should be

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.380 
power is 270 watts so that should be
sufficient<00:01:53.650> for<00:01:54.070> what<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.340> want<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.060> mean

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
sufficient for what I want it for I mean

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.280 
sufficient for what I want it for I mean
it's<00:01:55.600> more<00:01:55.810> powerful<00:01:56.350> than<00:01:56.470> any<00:01:56.680> young

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it's more powerful than any young

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's more powerful than any young

leads<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.519> I've<00:02:25.700> got<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.940> connected

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
leads on there and I've got it connected

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.290 
leads on there and I've got it connected
up<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.629> my<00:02:26.750> RC<00:02:27.200> charger<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.910> then<00:02:29.030> I've<00:02:29.150> got<00:02:29.269> my

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
up to my RC charger and then I've got my

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.130 
up to my RC charger and then I've got my
step<00:02:30.260> up<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:32.000> which<00:02:32.239> will<00:02:32.420> convert<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
step up and here which will convert the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.650 
step up and here which will convert the
12<00:02:33.440> volts<00:02:33.950> which<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.819> what<00:02:35.180> currently

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
12 volts which is what currently

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.390 
12 volts which is what currently
connected<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.319> could<00:02:36.560> have<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.800> 5<00:02:37.010> volts

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
connected but I could have the 5 volts

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.449 
connected but I could have the 5 volts
on<00:02:37.580> there<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:39.470> will<00:02:39.590> convert<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.129> form

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
on there it will convert that form

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.509 
on there it will convert that form
either<00:02:40.720> 512<00:02:41.720> or<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.080> could<00:02:42.200> even<00:02:42.290> use<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.560> 3.3

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
either 512 or you could even use a 3.3

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.479 
either 512 or you could even use a 3.3
and<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.420> will<00:02:44.510> go<00:02:44.660> anywhere<00:02:44.780> between<00:02:45.489> all

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
and that will go anywhere between all

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.509 
and that will go anywhere between all

equipment<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> hear<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.440> think<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.519> was<00:03:01.640> about

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
equipment to hear I think this was about

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.410 
equipment to hear I think this was about
10<00:03:02.120> pounds<00:03:02.569> off<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.810> ebay<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:05.090> handy<00:03:05.390> for

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
10 pounds off of ebay it's handy for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.180 
10 pounds off of ebay it's handy for
charge<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.959> lead-acid<00:03:06.140> batteries<00:03:06.890> if<00:03:07.069> you've

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
charge and lead-acid batteries if you've

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.729 
charge and lead-acid batteries if you've
got<00:03:07.340> them<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.579> series<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> 48<00:03:09.650> volt

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
got them in series so like a 48 volt

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.580 
got them in series so like a 48 volt
pack<00:03:10.129> even<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.910> use<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.140> charge<00:03:12.410> to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
pack even you can use this to charge to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.979 
pack even you can use this to charge to
pack<00:03:12.799> up<00:03:13.040> anywhere<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.209> our<00:03:14.450> switch<00:03:14.840> you're

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
pack up anywhere just our switch you're

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.130 
pack up anywhere just our switch you're
on<00:03:16.209> yeah<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.450> there<00:03:17.629> we<00:03:17.720> go

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
on yeah so there we go

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.180 
on yeah so there we go
it's<00:03:18.349> working<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> old<00:03:20.780> RC<00:03:21.200> charger<00:03:21.739> connect

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's working the old RC charger connect

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.330 
it's working the old RC charger connect
it<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:23.079> this<00:03:24.079> side<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.410> draw<00:03:24.620> six<00:03:24.980> amps

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it up there this side you draw six amps

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.599 
it up there this side you draw six amps
anyway<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:27.230> will<00:03:27.500> definitely<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.280> more

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
anyway so this will definitely be more

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.099 
anyway so this will definitely be more
than<00:03:28.760> powerful<00:03:29.090> enough<00:03:29.299> for<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.079> I

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
than powerful enough for this here I

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.740 
than powerful enough for this here I
could<00:03:30.470> probably<00:03:30.620> even<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.040> couple<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
could probably even have a couple of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.680 
could probably even have a couple of
these<00:03:32.959> connected<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:35.540> normally

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
these connected to it I don't normally

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.349 
these connected to it I don't normally
charge<00:03:36.109> at<00:03:36.349> 6<00:03:36.620> amps<00:03:36.920> anyway<00:03:37.280> we<00:03:38.150> don't

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
charge at 6 amps anyway we don't

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.150 
charge at 6 amps anyway we don't
normally<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> fast<00:03:39.170> charge<00:03:39.530> my<00:03:39.709> battery

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
normally like to fast charge my battery

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.660 
normally like to fast charge my battery
so<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:41.019> should<00:03:42.019> be<00:03:42.139> I<00:03:42.680> usually<00:03:43.250> charge<00:03:43.459> at

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
so that should be I usually charge at

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.909 
so that should be I usually charge at
about<00:03:43.880> 3<00:03:44.150> amps<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:47.420> probably<00:03:48.109> have<00:03:48.440> my<00:03:48.590> own<00:03:50.919> imax

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
about 3 amps I probably have my own imax

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.099 
about 3 amps I probably have my own imax
b6<00:03:52.010> connected<00:03:53.000> up<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.419> as<00:03:53.510> well<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.079> can

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
b6 connected up to it as well so I can

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.379 
b6 connected up to it as well so I can
charge<00:03:54.530> more<00:03:54.769> batteries<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.459> one<00:03:55.639> guy<00:03:58.389> yeah

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
charge more batteries and one guy yeah

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.259 
charge more batteries and one guy yeah
there's<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.870> R<00:04:00.019> step<00:04:00.410> up<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.769> there<00:04:01.150> at<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
there's the R step up and there at the

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.920 
there's the R step up and there at the
moment<00:04:02.419> well<00:04:02.959> where<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.440> was<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:04.010> in<00:04:04.130> here

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
moment well where I was going in here

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.839 
moment well where I was going in here
and<00:04:05.930> then<00:04:06.049> we've<00:04:06.200> got<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.500> output<00:04:07.099> here<00:04:07.669> with

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
and then we've got the output here with

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.479 
and then we've got the output here with
ammonia<00:04:08.359> connected<00:04:08.810> up<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
ammonia connected up and the

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.569 
ammonia connected up and the
potentiometer<00:04:11.359> is<00:04:12.079> here<00:04:12.530> which<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.250> control

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
potentiometer is here which you control

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.779 
potentiometer is here which you control
the<00:04:13.880> arm<00:04:14.090> output<00:04:14.480> voltage<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.319> output

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
the arm output voltage and the output

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.089 
the arm output voltage and the output
amperage<00:04:16.789> on<00:04:16.970> here<00:04:17.349> at<00:04:18.349> the<00:04:18.440> moment<00:04:18.470> it's<00:04:18.919> at

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
amperage on here at the moment it's at

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:24.089 
amperage on here at the moment it's at
15<00:04:19.669> volts<00:04:20.630> we'll<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:21.049> turn<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.289> up<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.709> bit

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:52.779 

to<00:04:25.099> show<00:04:25.340> you

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.329 

yep<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.029> you<00:04:54.059> can<00:04:54.269> go<00:04:54.389> after<00:04:55.229> ie<00:04:55.529> volts<00:04:56.009> on<00:04:56.159> that

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:56.339 
yep so you can go after ie volts on that

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.369 
yep so you can go after ie volts on that
Union<00:04:56.639> if<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:56.969> want<00:04:57.149> to<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.569> don't<00:04:58.199> normally

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
Union if you want to I don't normally

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
Union if you want to I don't normally
use<00:04:58.589> it<00:04:58.919> there<00:04:59.069> much<00:05:00.830> usually<00:05:01.830> use<00:05:02.159> it<00:05:02.339> around

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:02.399 
use it there much usually use it around

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:07.729 
use it there much usually use it around
about<00:05:03.139> 24<00:05:04.139> to<00:05:04.499> 48<00:05:04.979> volts<00:05:06.349> yeah<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.589> is

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:07.739 
about 24 to 48 volts yeah this is

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.919 
about 24 to 48 volts yeah this is
probably<00:05:08.129> the<00:05:08.339> safest<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.569> probably<00:05:09.809> the

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:09.929 
probably the safest this is probably the

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:12.309 
probably the safest this is probably the
safest<00:05:10.110> way<00:05:10.499> to<00:05:10.529> use<00:05:10.860> this

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
safest way to use this

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.229 
safest way to use this
there's<00:05:13.319> taking<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.129> apart<00:05:14.399> there<00:05:14.699> are<00:05:14.879> there

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:15.239 
there's taking it apart there are there

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:19.639 
there's taking it apart there are there
are<00:05:16.219> high<00:05:17.219> volt<00:05:17.550> which<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:17.699> inside<00:05:18.209> this<00:05:18.649> 240

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649 
are high volt which is inside this 240

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.109 
are high volt which is inside this 240
volts<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.069> then<00:05:20.189> you've<00:05:20.309> got<00:05:20.429> the<00:05:20.519> capacitors

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:21.119 
volts and then you've got the capacitors

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.439 
volts and then you've got the capacitors
that<00:05:21.149> are<00:05:21.330> charged<00:05:21.839> up<00:05:22.739> to<00:05:22.949> like<00:05:23.099> 200<00:05:23.759> volts<00:05:24.179> so

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
that are charged up to like 200 volts so

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.499 
that are charged up to like 200 volts so
it's<00:05:25.349> not<00:05:25.469> really<00:05:25.739> worth<00:05:25.769> opening<00:05:26.399> it<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.819> can

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
it's not really worth opening it you can

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.879 
it's not really worth opening it you can
just<00:05:27.539> use<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:28.589> make<00:05:28.769> a<00:05:28.800> little

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
just use this and make a little

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.799 
just use this and make a little
breadboard<00:05:29.550> type<00:05:29.879> thing<00:05:30.269> up<00:05:30.419> with<00:05:30.599> some

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:30.809 
breadboard type thing up with some

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:33.290 
breadboard type thing up with some
binding<00:05:31.319> posts<00:05:31.739> or<00:05:32.029> that<00:05:33.029> would<00:05:33.119> be<00:05:33.239> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
binding posts or that would be the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.649 
binding posts or that would be the
easiest<00:05:33.779> way<00:05:34.729> all<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.849> have<00:05:35.939> to<00:05:36.089> do<00:05:36.209> to<00:05:36.360> start

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
easiest way all you have to do to start

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.399 
easiest way all you have to do to start
it<00:05:36.869> up<00:05:36.989> is<00:05:38.329> you<00:05:39.329> see<00:05:39.749> there<00:05:40.019> I've<00:05:40.259> got<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.559> yum

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
it up is you see there I've got the yum

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.219 
it up is you see there I've got the yum
connected<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:43.529> the<00:05:43.649> ground<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:45.079> just<00:05:46.079> put<00:05:46.199> that

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
connected to the ground I just put that

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.739 
connected to the ground I just put that
little<00:05:46.349> jumper<00:05:46.860> wire<00:05:47.069> in<00:05:47.339> there<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:48.360> start<00:05:48.659> the

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:48.749 
little jumper wire in there to start the

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:53.779 
little jumper wire in there to start the
power<00:05:48.959> supply<00:05:49.379> up<00:05:51.259> and<00:05:52.259> in<00:05:52.409> just<00:05:52.439> leader<00:05:52.860> dummy

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
power supply up and in just leader dummy

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.379 
power supply up and in just leader dummy
load<00:05:53.969> which<00:05:54.779> can<00:05:54.809> be<00:05:55.110> one<00:05:55.499> of<00:05:55.619> these<00:05:55.709> bulbs

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
load which can be one of these bulbs

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.299 
load which can be one of these bulbs
connected<00:05:57.389> up<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:57.659> either<00:05:57.779> the<00:05:57.990> 5<00:05:58.199> or<00:05:58.409> 12<00:05:58.769> volt

00:05:59.299 --> 00:05:59.309 
connected up to either the 5 or 12 volt

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.489 
connected up to either the 5 or 12 volt
rail<00:05:59.449> you<00:06:00.449> should<00:06:00.599> really<00:06:00.869> have<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.110> connected

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:01.499 
rail you should really have it connected

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.919 
rail you should really have it connected
to<00:06:01.679> the<00:06:01.800> rail<00:06:02.339> with<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.819> highest<00:06:03.509> amount<00:06:03.779> of

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:03.929 
to the rail with the highest amount of

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.399 
to the rail with the highest amount of
amperage<00:06:04.379> so<00:06:05.159> I<00:06:05.189> want<00:06:05.399> here<00:06:06.199> you<00:06:07.199> should

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
amperage so I want here you should

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.049 
amperage so I want here you should
really<00:06:07.649> have<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.979> connected<00:06:08.339> to<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.579> 5<00:06:08.789> volt

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:09.059 
really have it connected to the 5 volt

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.449 
really have it connected to the 5 volt
because<00:06:09.269> this<00:06:09.539> 22<00:06:10.050> amps<00:06:10.349> on<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.769> 5<00:06:11.039> volt<00:06:11.339> and

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:11.459 
because this 22 amps on the 5 volt and

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:15.589 
because this 22 amps on the 5 volt and
only<00:06:11.819> 20<00:06:12.240> on<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.509> 12<00:06:13.459> so<00:06:14.459> yeah<00:06:15.209> you<00:06:15.419> really

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
only 20 on the 12 so yeah you really

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.799 
only 20 on the 12 so yeah you really
want<00:06:15.839> this<00:06:15.929> connected<00:06:16.409> up<00:06:17.479> whichever<00:06:18.479> rails

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 
want this connected up whichever rails

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:20.899 
want this connected up whichever rails
rails<00:06:19.289> gotten<00:06:19.649> an<00:06:19.740> all-around<00:06:20.009> good<00:06:20.249> job<00:06:20.490> and

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
rails gotten an all-around good job and

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.079 
rails gotten an all-around good job and
that<00:06:20.939> will<00:06:21.149> stabilize<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.929> output<00:06:22.289> voltage

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
that will stabilize the output voltage

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.689 
that will stabilize the output voltage
yeah<00:06:24.119> hey<00:06:24.629> they're<00:06:25.110> definitely<00:06:25.499> handy<00:06:25.979> to

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
yeah hey they're definitely handy to

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.249 
yeah hey they're definitely handy to
have<00:06:26.909> and<00:06:27.719> well<00:06:27.929> worth<00:06:28.279> reusing<00:06:29.279> recycling

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
have and well worth reusing recycling

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.469 
have and well worth reusing recycling
into<00:06:31.259> something<00:06:31.709> else

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
into something else

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.199 
into something else
yes<00:06:33.479> so<00:06:33.779> I<00:06:34.550> hope<00:06:35.550> you<00:06:35.729> I<00:06:35.759> should<00:06:35.969> have<00:06:36.089> this

yes so I hope you I should have this

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:38.540 
yes so I hope you I should have this
setup<00:06:36.539> side<00:06:36.989> I<00:06:37.289> may<00:06:37.589> you<00:06:37.649> put<00:06:37.860> it<00:06:37.949> inside<00:06:38.309> this

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
setup side I may you put it inside this

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.909 
setup side I may you put it inside this

all right so just a warning I win advise
anybody<00:07:00.819> to<00:07:01.030> take<00:07:01.360> one<00:07:01.569> of<00:07:01.599> these<00:07:01.750> apart<00:07:02.250> even

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
anybody to take one of these apart even

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.159 
anybody to take one of these apart even
after<00:07:03.520> you've<00:07:03.639> got<00:07:03.759> the<00:07:03.849> mains<00:07:04.169> disconnected

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
after you've got the mains disconnected

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.140 
after you've got the mains disconnected
this<00:07:05.409> capacitors<00:07:06.069> inside<00:07:06.219> here<00:07:06.819> which<00:07:07.000> are

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
this capacitors inside here which are

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.990 
this capacitors inside here which are
charged<00:07:07.479> up<00:07:07.659> to<00:07:07.689> 200<00:07:08.349> volts<00:07:08.639> and<00:07:09.639> if<00:07:09.759> you<00:07:09.849> go

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
charged up to 200 volts and if you go

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.379 
charged up to 200 volts and if you go
and<00:07:10.150> touch<00:07:10.300> the<00:07:10.599> basis<00:07:11.319> of<00:07:11.439> those<00:07:11.530> capacitors

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
and touch the basis of those capacitors

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.480 
and touch the basis of those capacitors
they<00:07:13.389> could<00:07:13.569> potentially<00:07:13.840> kill<00:07:14.319> you<00:07:14.530> so<00:07:15.069> I

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
they could potentially kill you so I

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.219 
they could potentially kill you so I
definitely<00:07:16.000> wouldn't<00:07:16.419> advise<00:07:16.689> anybody<00:07:16.810> to

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
definitely wouldn't advise anybody to

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.779 
definitely wouldn't advise anybody to
take<00:07:17.500> one<00:07:17.680> of<00:07:17.710> these<00:07:17.830> apart<00:07:17.979> not<00:07:18.490> unless<00:07:18.639> I

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
take one of these apart not unless I

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.999 
take one of these apart not unless I
really<00:07:19.030> know<00:07:19.300> what<00:07:19.330> I<00:07:19.539> do<00:07:19.599> it<00:07:19.900> and<00:07:20.620> if<00:07:20.860> I<00:07:20.949> do

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009 
really know what I do it and if I do

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.999 
really know what I do it and if I do
take<00:07:21.340> it<00:07:21.520> apart<00:07:21.789> to<00:07:22.120> make<00:07:22.830> sure<00:07:23.830> you've<00:07:23.979> got

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 
take it apart to make sure you've got

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.679 
take it apart to make sure you've got
the<00:07:24.189> mains<00:07:24.430> disconnected<00:07:25.180> and<00:07:25.300> leave<00:07:25.449> it<00:07:25.599> for

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:25.689 
the mains disconnected and leave it for

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.659 
the mains disconnected and leave it for
at<00:07:25.810> least<00:07:25.870> five<00:07:26.199> to<00:07:26.409> ten<00:07:26.620> minutes<00:07:26.949> after<00:07:27.430> and

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:27.669 
at least five to ten minutes after and

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:28.890 
at least five to ten minutes after and
then<00:07:27.849> check<00:07:28.090> the<00:07:28.240> voltage<00:07:28.599> on<00:07:28.719> the<00:07:28.870> capacitor

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900 
then check the voltage on the capacitor

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.980 
then check the voltage on the capacitor
a<00:07:29.530> multimeter<00:07:30.270> and<00:07:31.270> that<00:07:31.419> means<00:07:31.569> and<00:07:31.750> you<00:07:31.810> can

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:31.990 
a multimeter and that means and you can

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.149 
a multimeter and that means and you can
be<00:07:32.080> sure<00:07:32.110> that<00:07:32.349> you're<00:07:32.590> not<00:07:32.740> going<00:07:32.919> to<00:07:32.979> get<00:07:33.099> a

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:33.159 
be sure that you're not going to get a

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:37.740 
be sure that you're not going to get a
shot<00:07:33.569> there<00:07:34.569> I<00:07:34.599> am<00:07:35.080> strongly<00:07:35.590> recommend<00:07:36.750> not

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
shot there I am strongly recommend not

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.830 
shot there I am strongly recommend not
taking<00:07:38.110> them<00:07:38.199> apart<00:07:38.500> in<00:07:38.590> the<00:07:38.650> first<00:07:38.800> place

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
taking them apart in the first place

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.840 
taking them apart in the first place
okay
