downloads<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:42.880> 720p<00:04:43.540> which<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.990> wonderful

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.150 

obviously<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.510> major<00:04:50.230> downside<00:04:50.590> with

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
obviously the the major downside with

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.920

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.900 
but that is how to watch youtube videos
on<00:06:01.780> your<00:06:01.960> Vita<00:06:02.140> as<00:06:02.410> well<00:06:02.590> as<00:06:02.680> save<00:06:03.010> them<00:06:03.280> for

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
offline viewing later which I thought

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.810 
offline viewing later which I thought
was<00:06:05.470> really<00:06:05.530> cool<00:06:05.770> even<00:06:06.280> if<00:06:06.370> we<00:06:06.490> get<00:06:06.700> an

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
was really cool even if we get an

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.610 
was really cool even if we get an
official<00:06:07.210> YouTube<00:06:07.600> app<00:06:07.810> which<00:06:08.230> is<00:06:08.380> looking

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
official YouTube app which is looking

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.040

unlikely<00:06:09.160> at<00:06:09.250> this<00:06:09.400> point<00:06:09.670> but<00:06:10.420> even<00:06:10.660> if<00:06:10.750> we<00:06:10.900> do

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
unlikely at this point but even if we do

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.780 
unlikely at this point but even if we do
get<00:06:11.230> an<00:06:11.350> official<00:06:11.710> YouTube<00:06:12.010> app<00:06:12.220> they<00:06:12.520> never

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790
