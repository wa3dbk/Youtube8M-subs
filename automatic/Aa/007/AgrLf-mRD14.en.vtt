this video on YouTube and I've been

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.040 
this video on YouTube and I've been
looking<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.440> lot<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.830> raised<00:00:08.760> garden<00:00:09.420> beds<00:00:09.630> and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
looking a lot of raised garden beds and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.280 
looking a lot of raised garden beds and
rain<00:00:10.889> barrels<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:12.330> inspired<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.960> do

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
rain barrels and was inspired to do

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.830 
rain barrels and was inspired to do
something<00:00:14.009> similar<00:00:16.940> there<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:19.580> three

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
something similar there are my three

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
something similar there are my three
raised<00:00:21.840> beds<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:23.840> started<00:00:24.859> then<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.510> after

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
raised beds that started then I go after

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
raised beds that started then I go after
I<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:27.960> all<00:00:28.170> set<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.980> three

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I get these all set up and then do three

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.730 
I get these all set up and then do three
more

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.139 

also<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:35.160> interested<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.700> doing<00:00:35.940> some

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
also got that interested in doing some

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:48.920 
also got that interested in doing some
hanging<00:00:36.390> vegetables<00:00:45.769> um<00:00:46.769> I<00:00:47.420> built<00:00:48.420> myself<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hanging vegetables um I built myself a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200 
hanging vegetables um I built myself a
rain<00:00:49.170> barrel<00:00:49.440> system<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.730> i<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:50.940> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
rain barrel system which i think is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
rain barrel system which i think is
pretty<00:00:51.390> good<00:00:51.659> I<00:00:52.100> got<00:00:53.100> two<00:00:53.309> 55-gallon<00:00:53.850> drums

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
pretty good I got two 55-gallon drums

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
pretty good I got two 55-gallon drums
and<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.970> hooked<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.170> roof<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and it is hooked up to the roof of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.450 
and it is hooked up to the roof of the
gutter

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gutter

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660

got it attached to a drip line over by
my<00:01:20.399> beds<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.460> given<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:23.880> enough

my beds and it's given me enough

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
my beds and it's given me enough
pressure<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:25.229> we've<00:01:25.440> got<00:01:25.590> show<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> around

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
pressure when we've got show you around

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
pressure when we've got show you around
me<00:01:26.720> what<00:01:27.720> I've<00:01:27.869> done<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:29.810> getting<00:01:30.810> some

me what I've done with this getting some

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.649 
me what I've done with this getting some
leaks<00:01:31.289> here<00:01:31.560> I've<00:01:32.220> been<00:01:32.369> trying<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
leaks here I've been trying to it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
leaks here I've been trying to it
up<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.929> can't<00:01:34.170> find<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.119> little

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
up I can't find it but just one little

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810 
up I can't find it but just one little
leak<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.899> little<00:01:37.200> drip

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.970 

but<00:01:40.420> like<00:01:40.870> I<00:01:40.930> said<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.260> pressure<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.710> pretty

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
but like I said the pressure is pretty

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.530 
but like I said the pressure is pretty
good<00:01:42.190> let<00:01:42.370> me<00:01:42.430> go<00:01:42.550> ahead<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.760> turn<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:42.970> on

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
good let me go ahead and turn it on

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.830 
good let me go ahead and turn it on
I<00:01:43.980> had<00:01:44.980> it<00:01:45.100> hooked<00:01:45.190> up<00:01:45.370> to<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.210> timer<00:01:46.540> over

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
I had it hooked up to it to a timer over

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.370 
I had it hooked up to it to a timer over
there<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.950> timer's<00:01:48.400> not<00:01:48.550> give<00:01:48.790> enough

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
there but the timer's not give enough

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
there but the timer's not give enough
holding<00:01:50.380> back<00:01:50.590> some<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.890> pressure<00:01:51.160> for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
holding back some of the pressure for

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.850 
holding back some of the pressure for
some<00:01:51.520> reason<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:54.070> there<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.670> go<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:56.530> took

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
some reason and there you go I just took

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.719 
some reason and there you go I just took
some<00:01:56.920> drip<00:01:57.250> line<00:01:57.490> up<00:01:57.640> puff<00:01:58.000> little<00:01:58.360> holes<00:01:58.600> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
some drip line up puff little holes a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.120 
some drip line up puff little holes a
few<00:02:00.729> holes<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.240> them<00:02:06.090> working<00:02:07.090> pretty<00:02:07.300> good

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
few holes in them working pretty good

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.469 
few holes in them working pretty good
I've<00:02:09.130> got<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.399> coming<00:02:09.610> down<00:02:09.940> through<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
I've got it coming down through the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.590 
I've got it coming down through the
ground<00:02:10.720> here<00:02:11.110> back<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:17.910> I'll<00:02:18.910> send<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
ground here back up and I'll send it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.720 
ground here back up and I'll send it
that<00:02:19.840> down<00:02:20.170> through<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.250> bed<00:02:21.520> when

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
that down through here to this bed when

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.300 
that down through here to this bed when
I<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.240> good<00:02:22.990> thing<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.350> growing<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.920> here

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
I get it good thing is growing in here

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.500 
I get it good thing is growing in here
I'm<00:02:25.150> thinking<00:02:25.990> about<00:02:26.260> how<00:02:26.590> ever<00:02:27.270> change<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.360> up

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
I'm thinking about how ever change it up

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.470 
I'm thinking about how ever change it up
to<00:02:28.540> PVC<00:02:29.230> pipe<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:31.150> give<00:02:31.330> more<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:33.480> consistent

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
to PVC pipe to give more of a consistent

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.580 
to PVC pipe to give more of a consistent
I<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:35.320> control<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> better

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
I can control it better

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.240 
I can control it better
and<00:02:38.099> that's<00:02:38.340> about<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.880> my<00:02:40.130> cucumbers<00:02:41.130> are

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and that's about it my cucumbers are

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.229 
and that's about it my cucumbers are
looking<00:02:41.520> pretty<00:02:41.700> good

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
looking pretty good

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.820
