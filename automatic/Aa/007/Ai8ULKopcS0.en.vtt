jumps<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> reason<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:31.520> had<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.729> as

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
jumps the reason I had them as

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
jumps the reason I had them as
interesting<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> recall<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> they

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
interesting as you recall was that they

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.660 
interesting as you recall was that they
were<00:01:34.799> taking<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:37.100> shocks<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.490> was

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
were taking all the shocks when I was

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.359 
were taking all the shocks when I was
running<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.290> enjoyed<00:01:40.680> running<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.189> them

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
running and I enjoyed running in them

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.539 
running and I enjoyed running in them
but<00:01:41.820> after<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.420> any<00:01:42.570> case<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.189> they

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
but after one in any case you know they

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.330 
but after one in any case you know they
were<00:01:44.610> wet<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> after<00:01:46.950> 600<00:01:47.490> case

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
were wet down and this is after 600 case

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.990 
were wet down and this is after 600 case
