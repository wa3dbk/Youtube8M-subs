00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.799
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.259
 another gameplay commentary on my 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.850
 Canaria in the background you can see 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.240
 Sniper gameplay from me r plays 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.470
 yes in black for two years as I said 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.910
 here the first weapons I think was 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.950
 The s12 I go there but also neat 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.420
 with api really nice with the laser in 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.650
 the opponents practically rhein pumped that 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.350
 I was not quite happy 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.059
 In the end, I believe 42 2 or something 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.040
 is actually quite nice you can on 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.350
 drop every case and I hate it when 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.780
 people say that yes I just know 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.650
 not myself why I does not matter 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.820
 Today I have a small team here 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.829
 never comes so what actually as a 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.910
 You can not say it's a bit serious 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.500
 has to do with gambling 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.470
 so it has to play me because of it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.550
 is not really serious but in that 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.500
 range something more serious yes 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.079
 I recently met a buddy from 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.369
 Spanking written with the blondie knows 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.439
 maybe some of you are like that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.670
 a fool is such a bunch just like that 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.139
 a really bad player knows 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.889
 actually everyone so he's the one about 

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:15.289
 Random number one is so he is one 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.600
 very good player and I have it now 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.039
 a bit written with him and me 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.389
 have him so rtl II I have none 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.310
 buck on big somehow that's full 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.109
 shit blabla I find the game 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.389
 just not so cool and he my part 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.939
 so to me yes thats you find it 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:30.319
 certainly good but i'll tell you youtube 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.389
 Does it make you bad the game 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.270
 or did i think i thought so 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:37.490
 like me, I can do my own 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 form opinion or not so my I 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.539
 find the game not good I looked 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.090
 thought but gone home 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.469
 and have my pc connected has one 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.729
 bit ghost turned on and because i 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.979
 the simple test would now simply 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.709
 times without the accusations of youtube 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.810
 So in fact everyone except youtuber 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.209
 which I do not have a montana black 88 now 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 does that actually each game bad 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.630
 so big and then you can almost 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.590
 So do not form your own opinion 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.689
 I did the game on 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.429
 Bit gambled and it went if you 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.020
 do not think about what the youtubers say 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.520
 so if they say so he keeps playing like that 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.180
 shit that you can not do in the power 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.220
 no fun 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.170
 sh 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.670
 fun is still fun now 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 , game really happy I now have 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.040
 ordered the hdmi later say a few 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.450
 Saturdays I can go to ps4 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.640
 record and then it will be on everyone 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.680
 case go because ghost is coming now 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080
 also at league play so league as well as in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 black ops 2 and then it gets it right 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.750
 it will definitely be one 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.510
 give series in league I'm there 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.680
 pretty sure 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.880
 and yes people I see have simply times 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.490
 played and I thought so 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.820
 old blondie's father has the real one 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.500
 right and that bothers me now 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 a little bit that youtuber what 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.790
 most of them really said that 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.270
 the game is shit because it is not 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.280
 can 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.540
 I already told you from the beginning 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.250
 the game i could play 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.410
 not a priori relatively good me 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.680
 I think I have a 25 quote or so 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.380
 is not bad in the game then it has 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.970
 I just did not enjoy it, but yes 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.680
 I have no idea now 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.530
 just started it now makes me mega 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 fun and it's just really youtube 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.970
 takes too much space, so to speak the game 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.709
 actually you should look for this 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.150
 opinion you can maybe because 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.260
 But I have to orient everybody 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.489
 actually still his own 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.530
 form opinion because it can not be 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.360
 that we play out come the new 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.970
 do not play because youtuber say that 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.380
 the shit are yes I have said as 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.200
 itself said that I do not play it 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.220
 Mark and I do not like it but the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.870
 opinion is actually pretty 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.370
 I have really changed that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.690
 to wear and in the defense of the blondie 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.360
 then his will be then then 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.060
 neat shrubbery of the league and yes 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.280
 I would just say that's it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.780
 yes that youtube has pretty much then or 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.180
 the big commentators pretty much the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.769
 Opinion of the normal players of the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.360
 Buy the game pretty much 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.970
 influence that says pretty much 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.700
 crass I said as I have it 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.440
 I realized that you can easily 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.989
 not clear and could be against clear 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.250
 It's just not possible to save one's head 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.690
 Just take them one way 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.530
 just follows the opinions 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.030
 the other 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410
 that's why it's just not complete 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.299
 that the outside joy is this 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 opinions but just try it 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.709
 so with free conscience practically at the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.540
 top just go a bit too 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.590
 play and played style continues 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.930
 really fun or 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.890
 then you learn the game and then you can 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.030
 you also get better and then do it 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.010
 you definitely 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.620
 because you die so fast is one 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 little difficulty and yes you have to 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.930
 first have to overcome a bit so 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.490
 you first know how to do that 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.830
 and so and how to actually play the game 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.940
 has to play and if you have the first time 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.970
 knows then it is definitely 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.870
 pretty much off and yes I wanted that now 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.340
 Just mention it 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.160
 for the people the duty of uncharted 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.300
 just to watch there comes tomorrow 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.550
 again a video because I have but you 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.430
 ask some questions 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.980
 A few things to mention today 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.360
 also no road to speak because the kabul 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.500
 It was not so good yesterday and me 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 It was not so good yesterday 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.780
 Today is also a hangover day 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.740
 I did a lot yesterday and so did I. 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.850
 I'm glad if I mean today 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.350
 have work behind me and then today 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.180
 Just sit down and play comfortably in the evening 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.520
 can if I get them at 11 30 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.200
 yes, even before I do it again 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.150
 Yes, I had to work again today 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.320
 Tomorrow at work the people 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.120
 have indeed seen the picture like mine 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.710
 have tended facebook page I 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.930
 a picture of me posted at work 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.280
 So for the people mine 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.900
 facebook page have not yet laid 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.040
 the link is in the video description 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.090
 and i would say if i did that 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.620
 completely changed is easy 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.830
 one up if not then 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.960
 Not

 and skin in until next time people
