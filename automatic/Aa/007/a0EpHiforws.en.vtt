we're gonna be talking about is the
katadyn<00:00:14.190> hiker<00:00:14.250> water<00:00:15.030> filter

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.950 

katadyn<00:00:31.160> hiker<00:00:31.220> water<00:00:31.940> filter<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.450> a<00:00:32.540> really

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
katadyn hiker water filter is a really

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.980 
katadyn hiker water filter is a really
super<00:00:33.380> easy<00:00:33.670> lightweight<00:00:34.670> water<00:00:35.060> filter<00:00:35.510> and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
super easy lightweight water filter and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.150 
super easy lightweight water filter and
can<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.230> be<00:00:36.350> used<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.770> variety<00:00:36.950> of

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
can you be used in a variety of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.280 
can you be used in a variety of
different<00:00:37.370> circumstances<00:00:38.140> basically<00:00:39.140> what

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
different circumstances basically what

different circumstances basically what
happens<00:00:39.740> is<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.400> have<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.730> main<00:00:40.910> housing

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
happens is you have the main housing

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.049 
happens is you have the main housing
filter<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:42.920> got<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.070> hose<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.790> hose

filter and it's got a hose and in hose

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.510 
filter and it's got a hose and in hose
and<00:00:45.040> an<00:00:46.040> out<00:00:46.220> hose<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:47.930> hose<00:00:48.200> has<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.160> little

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
and an out hose the in hose has a little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.670 
and an out hose the in hose has a little
external<00:00:49.879> filter<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.570> which<00:00:51.410> will<00:00:51.500> take

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
external filter on it which will take

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.890 
external filter on it which will take
out<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.040> debris<00:00:52.400> like<00:00:52.700> leaves<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.420> silt<00:00:53.690> and

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
out the debris like leaves and silt and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.299 
out the debris like leaves and silt and
things<00:00:54.080> like<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:55.010> got<00:00:55.129> like<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
things like that and it's got like a

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.680 
things like that and it's got like a
little<00:00:55.400> float<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:56.660> actually

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
little float on it that you can actually

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.410 
little float on it that you can actually
move<00:00:57.050> up<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.500> down<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.550> if<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.790> want<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.300> be

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
move up and down so if you want it to be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.110 
move up and down so if you want it to be
higher<00:00:59.690> or<00:01:00.409> lower<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:01.010> like<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.519> bobber<00:01:01.850> on<00:01:02.089> a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
higher or lower and like a bobber on a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.000 
higher or lower and like a bobber on a
fishing<00:01:02.420> line<00:01:02.750> will<00:01:03.230> allow<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.589> put<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:03.920> in

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
fishing line will allow you to put it in

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.439 
fishing line will allow you to put it in
the<00:01:04.129> water<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.460> keep<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> at<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:04.970> higher<00:01:05.180> level

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the water and keep it at a higher level

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.630 
the water and keep it at a higher level
and<00:01:05.690> keep<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.900> away<00:01:05.990> from<00:01:06.110> impurities<00:01:06.980> or<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
and keep it away from impurities or the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.350 
and keep it away from impurities or the
lower<00:01:07.790> level

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
lower level

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.820 
lower level
it's<00:01:08.600> got<00:01:08.750> another<00:01:09.020> hose<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.350> comes<00:01:09.500> out<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's got another hose that comes out the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.680 
it's got another hose that comes out the
top<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.670> where<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> actual<00:01:11.210> filtered

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
top this is where the actual filtered

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.500 
top this is where the actual filtered
water<00:01:11.840> comes<00:01:12.229> out<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.940> pump<00:01:14.210> and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
water comes out to you and a pump and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.750 
water comes out to you and a pump and
that's<00:01:14.720> basically<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.040> have<00:01:16.220> the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
that's basically it so you have the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.670 
that's basically it so you have the
clothes<00:01:16.970> going<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.600> water<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.530> other

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
clothes going in the water and the other

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.710 
clothes going in the water and the other
hose<00:01:18.950> that's<00:01:19.340> coming<00:01:19.729> out<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.510> your

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
hose that's coming out to you in your

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.440 
hose that's coming out to you in your
bottle<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.380> your<00:01:21.850> filter<00:01:22.850> or<00:01:23.000> whatever<00:01:23.300> you

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
bottle into your filter or whatever you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.060 
bottle into your filter or whatever you
want<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.720> put<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.290> then<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.860> simply

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
want to put it in and then you simply

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.330 
want to put it in and then you simply
just<00:01:25.430> use<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.850> pump<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:27.770> push<00:01:27.950> your<00:01:28.130> water

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
just use the pump to push your water

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.160 
just use the pump to push your water
through<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.729> filter<00:01:28.909> system<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:29.750> this

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
through the filter system and this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.440 
through the filter system and this
particular<00:01:30.710> system<00:01:31.100> takes<00:01:31.370> most<00:01:32.000> everything

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
particular system takes most everything

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.420 
particular system takes most everything
out<00:01:32.660> takes<00:01:33.050> about<00:01:33.200> 99%<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:34.160> all<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
out takes about 99% of all the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.130 
out takes about 99% of all the
impurities<00:01:34.880> out<00:01:35.060> including<00:01:35.360> cysts<00:01:35.840> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
impurities out including cysts and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.230 
impurities out including cysts and
Giardia<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.710> microbes<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.910> things<00:01:38.090> like

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
Giardia and microbes and things like

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.070 
Giardia and microbes and things like
that<00:01:38.350> once<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:40.300> think<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.660> filter<00:01:41.990> is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
that once you think that the filter is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.770 
that once you think that the filter is
about<00:01:42.350> done<00:01:42.620> where<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.640> been<00:01:43.790> used<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.660> can

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
about done where it's been used you can

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.590 
about done where it's been used you can
simply<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.680> unscrew<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.310> top<00:01:46.490> look<00:01:47.360> at<00:01:47.480> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
simply just unscrew the top look at the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.690 
simply just unscrew the top look at the
filter<00:01:47.960> if<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.470> got<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> nice<00:01:48.920> clean<00:01:49.400> white

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
filter if it's got a nice clean white

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.780 
filter if it's got a nice clean white
filter<00:01:50.240> looking<00:01:51.110> like<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.830> one<00:01:52.010> has<00:01:52.220> then

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
filter looking like this one has then

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.340 
filter looking like this one has then
your<00:01:52.970> great<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.390> still<00:01:53.600> got<00:01:53.750> plenty<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:54.050> room
