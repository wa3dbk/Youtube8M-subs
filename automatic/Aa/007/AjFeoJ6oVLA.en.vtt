have<00:00:33.399> four<00:00:33.730> petals<00:00:34.360> here<00:00:34.570> one<00:00:35.109> of<00:00:35.230> which<00:00:35.320> is

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
have four petals here one of which is

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.600 
have four petals here one of which is
particularly<00:00:36.340> new<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:37.860> few<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:38.890> few<00:00:39.250> ones

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
particularly new and a few a few ones

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.650 
particularly new and a few a few ones
that<00:00:39.760> have<00:00:39.850> been<00:00:39.970> around<00:00:40.060> for<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.390> little<00:00:40.480> while

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
that have been around for a little while

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.880 
that have been around for a little while
you<00:00:40.810> want<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.050> tell<00:00:41.170> us<00:00:41.200> about<00:00:41.380> these<00:00:41.649> here

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
you want to tell us about these here

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.569 
you want to tell us about these here
yeah<00:00:42.489> sure<00:00:42.790> um<00:00:43.060> right<00:00:43.480> now<00:00:43.510> I'm<00:00:43.690> showing<00:00:44.140> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
yeah sure um right now I'm showing the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.549 
yeah sure um right now I'm showing the
set<00:00:45.579> adrift<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:45.880> memory<00:00:46.090> bliss<00:00:46.450> it's<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.230> delay

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
set adrift on memory bliss it's a delay

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.950 
set adrift on memory bliss it's a delay
um<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.579> then<00:00:49.059> light<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:49.630> can<00:00:49.780> actually

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
um and then light you can actually

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.830 
um and then light you can actually
modulate<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.430> sound<00:00:51.700> bit<00:00:52.030> through<00:00:52.630> the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
modulate the sound bit through the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.660 
modulate the sound bit through the
through<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.469> pedal<00:00:53.739> or<00:00:53.950> through<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.370> wand

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
through the pedal or through the wand

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.260 
through the pedal or through the wand
which<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.360> our<00:00:55.719> new<00:00:55.899> little<00:00:56.670> device<00:00:57.670> here<00:00:57.700> that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
which is our new little device here that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.010 
which is our new little device here that
can<00:00:58.690> either<00:01:00.239> influence<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.390> pitch<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.840> what

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
can either influence the pitch of what

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.200 
can either influence the pitch of what
you're<00:01:02.170> playing<00:01:02.320> or<00:01:03.239> yes<00:01:04.239> sir<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.659> uh<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
you're playing or yes sir and uh it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.969 
you're playing or yes sir and uh it
controls<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.659> pitch<00:01:07.869> or<00:01:08.200> controls<00:01:08.770> I

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
controls the pitch or controls I

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.039 
controls the pitch or controls I
actually<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.180> rate<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.570> modulation

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
actually the the rate of the modulation

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually the the rate of the modulation
so<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.500> can<00:01:11.710> light<00:01:11.920> start

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.190 

you<00:01:33.460> want<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> show<00:01:33.880> us<00:01:33.910> how<00:01:34.120> some<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
you want to show us how some of the the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.660 
you want to show us how some of the the
controls<00:01:35.650> here<00:01:35.800> affect<00:01:36.190> those<00:01:36.310> parameters

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
controls here affect those parameters

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.330 
controls here affect those parameters
other<00:01:37.030> word<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.420> am<00:01:37.870> back<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.470> um<00:01:38.800> you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
other word I am back here um you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.360 
other word I am back here um you
actually<00:01:39.730> have<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.210> UM<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.950> pedal<00:01:41.950> itself

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
actually have the UM the pedal itself

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.340 
actually have the UM the pedal itself
controlling<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> modulation<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.170> can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
controlling the modulation so you can

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.290 
controlling the modulation so you can
turn<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.680> down<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.550> get<00:01:45.700> your<00:01:45.850> your

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
turn it down you just get your your

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.970 
turn it down you just get your your
regular<00:01:46.900> cling<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.350> life<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.500> turn<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.710> up

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
regular cling to life you can turn it up

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.590 
regular cling to life you can turn it up
to<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.430> getting<00:01:51.700> there<00:01:51.910> about<00:01:52.090> anything<00:01:52.360> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
to and getting there about anything you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.990 
to and getting there about anything you
want<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:53.080> far<00:01:53.320> as<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:54.250> loud<00:01:54.580> out<00:01:54.940> there<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
want as far as just loud out there and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.420 
want as far as just loud out there and
then<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:02.140> turn<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.680> function<00:02:03.070> knob<00:02:03.220> over

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
then if you turn the function knob over

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.270 
then if you turn the function knob over
you<00:02:03.970> get<00:02:04.240> what<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.110> was<00:02:05.290> playing<00:02:05.560> before<00:02:05.680> which

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
you get what I was playing before which

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.040 
you get what I was playing before which
we're<00:02:06.970> getting<00:02:07.150> some<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.450> low<00:02:07.750> clock

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
we're getting some of that low clock

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.050 
we're getting some of that low clock
speed<00:02:08.380> if<00:02:08.619> you're<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:09.130> completely<00:02:09.280> dark<00:02:09.880> on

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
speed if you're like completely dark on

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.800 
speed if you're like completely dark on
it<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.790> light<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.270> setting<00:02:13.660> you're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
it but on light on this setting you're

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.300 
it but on light on this setting you're
actually<00:02:13.930> controlling<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.650> pitch<00:02:14.890> with<00:02:15.130> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
actually controlling the pitch with that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.460 
actually controlling the pitch with that
because<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:15.959> playing<00:02:16.959> around<00:02:17.170> with<00:02:17.320> that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
because it's playing around with that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.150 
because it's playing around with that
clock<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.560> setting<00:02:21.010> you're

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
clock and then on this setting you're

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.980 
clock and then on this setting you're
actually<00:02:21.310> controlling<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.150> rate<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
actually controlling the rate of the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:34.130 
actually controlling the rate of the
modulation<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.950> you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.120 

you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.290> say<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:35.740> for<00:02:35.890> really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
you can say this up for really

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.680 
you can say this up for really
conventional<00:02:36.700> delay<00:02:36.940> sound<00:02:37.210> too<00:02:37.450> if<00:02:37.570> you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
conventional delay sound too if you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.660 
conventional delay sound too if you
wanted<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.170> write<00:02:38.410> sure<00:02:38.860> well<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.520> just

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
wanted to write sure well you just

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.690 
wanted to write sure well you just
turned<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.120> mod<00:02:41.020> all<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> way<00:02:41.440> down<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.010> just

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
turned the mod all the way down and just

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.040 
turned the mod all the way down and just
use<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> speech<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.750> would<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> normal

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
use the speech like you would a normal

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:57.270 
use the speech like you would a normal
delay<00:02:44.650> speeding<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.190> feedback<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.970> say<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
delay speeding and feedback and say you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.980 
delay speeding and feedback and say you
can<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:57.550> pretty<00:02:57.700> nasty<00:02:58.030> down<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.450> some<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
can get pretty nasty down in some of the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:14.150 
can get pretty nasty down in some of the
longer<00:02:59.320> delays<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.010> it's<00:03:00.550> still<00:03:00.730> fun

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.280 

sounds<00:03:15.160> great<00:03:15.370> man<00:03:15.580> that's<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.660> Bliss<00:03:16.870> right

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
sounds great man that's the Bliss right

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.660 
sounds great man that's the Bliss right
set<00:03:20.290> adrift<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.560> memory<00:03:21.090> okay<00:03:23.490> now<00:03:24.490> what's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
set adrift on memory okay now what's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.460 
set adrift on memory okay now what's
this<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.000> over<00:03:25.210> here<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.990> right<00:03:26.200> here<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
this one over here this right here is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.850 
this one over here this right here is
our<00:03:26.680> circadian<00:03:27.040> it's<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:28.030> polyrhythmic<00:03:28.860> ottawa

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
our circadian it's a polyrhythmic ottawa

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.310 
our circadian it's a polyrhythmic ottawa
why<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.460> basically<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.420> every<00:03:32.170> other

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
why it basically is like every other

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380 
why it basically is like every other
ottawa<00:03:32.860> but<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.340> jumping<00:03:34.060> around<00:03:34.120> i'm

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
ottawa but it's jumping around i'm

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.800 
ottawa but it's jumping around i'm
playing<00:03:34.630> your<00:03:34.840> uh<00:03:34.950> your<00:03:36.300> frequency<00:03:37.300> spectrum

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
playing your uh your frequency spectrum

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.440 
playing your uh your frequency spectrum
like<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.220> drum<00:03:39.490> machine<00:03:39.610> would<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.360> you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
like a like a drum machine would so you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.030 
like a like a drum machine would so you
can<00:03:40.570> actually<00:03:40.720> program<00:03:41.110> your<00:03:41.440> own<00:03:41.470> beats<00:03:41.770> in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
can actually program your own beats in

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.090 
can actually program your own beats in
there<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.540> want<00:03:43.780> ten<00:03:44.050> ten<00:03:44.530> beats<00:03:44.740> in<00:03:44.980> your

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
there on you want ten ten beats in your

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.880 
there on you want ten ten beats in your
little<00:03:45.310> program<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.300> put<00:03:46.540> ten<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.290> get<00:03:47.680> ten

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
little program you put ten you get ten

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.250 
little program you put ten you get ten
sliders<00:03:48.460> you<00:03:49.120> can<00:03:49.270> set<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> filter<00:03:49.870> wherever

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
sliders you can set the filter wherever

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.910 
sliders you can set the filter wherever
you<00:03:50.350> want<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.890> then<00:03:52.080> it's<00:03:53.080> real<00:03:53.410> versatile

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
you want and then it's real versatile

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.910 
you want and then it's real versatile
right<00:03:54.160> now<00:03:54.370> like<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.790> got<00:03:54.940> some<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.240> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
right now like we got some of the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:18.180 
right now like we got some of the
hard-coded<00:03:56.920> rhythms<00:03:57.730> going<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.240> but

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.590 

so<00:04:19.190> what's<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> range<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.820> tempo<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.419> this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
so what's the range of tempo on this

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.710 
so what's the range of tempo on this
then<00:04:20.810> well<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.669> go<00:04:22.820> from<00:04:23.060> light<00:04:23.389> near

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
then well you can go from light near

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.219 
then well you can go from light near
about<00:04:24.370> non-existent<00:04:25.370> movement<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.960> wrap

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
about non-existent movement to just wrap

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:38.460 
about non-existent movement to just wrap
it<00:04:27.260> crazy<00:04:28.330> stuff<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:31.630> you're<00:04:32.630> up<00:04:32.750> here<00:04:32.990> you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.350 

can<00:04:39.470> get<00:04:39.620> some<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> speech<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.240> you

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
can get some of the speech that you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.350 
can get some of the speech that you
really<00:04:41.750> can't<00:04:42.410> get<00:04:42.650> tapping<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.400> because<00:04:43.970> um

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
really can't get tapping it because um

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.180 
really can't get tapping it because um
you<00:04:44.930> know<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.110> number<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.740> beats<00:04:45.919> that's

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
you know the number of beats that's

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.070 
you know the number of beats that's
actually<00:04:46.610> in<00:04:46.729> its<00:04:46.940> arbitrary<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:47.870> there's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
actually in its arbitrary so if there's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.270 
actually in its arbitrary so if there's
a<00:04:48.139> hundred<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.650> there<00:04:48.770> you're<00:04:48.949> not<00:04:49.010> going<00:04:49.220> to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
a hundred in there you're not going to

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.800 
a hundred in there you're not going to
be<00:04:49.340> able<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.580> type<00:04:49.729> fast<00:04:50.000> enough<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.389> get<00:04:50.510> that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
be able to type fast enough to get that

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.710 
be able to type fast enough to get that
so<00:04:51.500> we<00:04:52.340> left<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.610> speed<00:04:52.910> knob<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.270> there<00:04:53.449> but

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
so we left the speed knob on there but

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.200 
so we left the speed knob on there but
if<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.930> turn<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.199> speed<00:04:54.440> knob<00:04:54.620> down<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:55.210> turn

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
if you turn the speed knob down I turn

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.120 
if you turn the speed knob down I turn
it<00:04:56.389> off<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.539> then<00:04:56.780> back<00:04:56.810> on<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.889> will<00:04:57.979> actually

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
it off and then back on it will actually

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.750 
it off and then back on it will actually
set<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.580> tempo<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.570> know<00:04:59.690> tap<00:05:00.080> for<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.740> um<00:05:00.949> if

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
set the tempo you know tap for you um if

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.029 
set the tempo you know tap for you um if
you<00:05:02.000> want<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.510> know<00:05:02.690> in<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.530> range<00:05:03.800> that

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
you want to you know in that range that

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.340 
you want to you know in that range that
you<00:05:04.070> can<00:05:04.160> actually<00:05:04.430> tap<00:05:05.240> your<00:05:05.389> foot<00:05:05.630> it's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
you can actually tap your foot it's

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.409 
you can actually tap your foot it's
almost<00:05:06.530> like<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.610> percussion<00:05:08.150> setting

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
almost like the the percussion setting

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.820 
almost like the the percussion setting
is<00:05:08.479> on<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.660> old<00:05:08.810> hammond<00:05:09.139> organ<00:05:09.199> or<00:05:09.530> something

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
is on the old hammond organ or something

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.490 
is on the old hammond organ or something
right<00:05:09.979> yeah<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:11.120> like<00:05:11.630> that<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.870> lot<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.380> I<00:05:12.470> like

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
right yeah I like that a lot and I like

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.400 
right yeah I like that a lot and I like
that<00:05:12.850> kind<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:13.940> relation<00:05:15.580> it's<00:05:16.580> definitely<00:05:16.820> a

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
that kind of relation it's definitely a

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.430 
that kind of relation it's definitely a
kind<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.530> using<00:05:19.370> your<00:05:19.490> guitar<00:05:20.020> like<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.050> drum

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
kind of using your guitar like a drum

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.110 
kind of using your guitar like a drum
machine<00:05:21.560> would<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.039> think<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.699> know<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:22.970> true

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
machine would I think you know it's true

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.659 
machine would I think you know it's true
cool<00:05:24.080> now<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.380> have<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.680> couple<00:05:25.039> really<00:05:25.370> sweet

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
cool now you have a couple really sweet

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.659 
cool now you have a couple really sweet
fusses<00:05:26.060> over<00:05:26.210> here<00:05:26.479> what<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.370> one<00:05:28.370> you<00:05:28.520> can

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
fusses over here what is a one you can

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.370 
fusses over here what is a one you can
set<00:05:28.910> for<00:05:29.150> pretty<00:05:29.330> conventional<00:05:29.660> fuzz<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.139> it

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
set for pretty conventional fuzz and it

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.409 
set for pretty conventional fuzz and it
sounded<00:05:30.620> great<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.099> then<00:05:31.729> one<00:05:32.000> over<00:05:32.210> here<00:05:32.360> is

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
sounded great and then one over here is

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.180 
sounded great and then one over here is
another<00:05:32.570> it's<00:05:32.840> pretty<00:05:33.050> chaotic<00:05:33.260> as<00:05:33.650> well<00:05:33.830> tell

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
another it's pretty chaotic as well tell

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.680 
another it's pretty chaotic as well tell
us<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.340> little<00:05:34.430> bit<00:05:34.550> about<00:05:34.729> these<00:05:34.940> two<00:05:35.120> okay

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.740 
us a little bit about these two okay
this<00:05:36.650> kingdom<00:05:37.039> by<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.160> sea<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:38.180> fudge

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
this kingdom by the sea is a fudge

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.500 
this kingdom by the sea is a fudge
distortion<00:05:39.320> kind<00:05:39.500> of<00:05:39.560> hybrid<00:05:39.740> thing<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.550> you

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
distortion kind of hybrid thing and you

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.500 
distortion kind of hybrid thing and you
know<00:05:42.310> it's<00:05:43.310> got<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.550> clipping<00:05:43.910> circuit<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.360> its

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
know it's got a clipping circuit of its

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.589 
know it's got a clipping circuit of its
own<00:05:44.660> and<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:45.139> is<00:05:45.800> pushed<00:05:46.550> through<00:05:46.669> a<00:05:46.820> own<00:05:47.210> a

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
own and it is pushed through a own a

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:54.060 
own and it is pushed through a own a
Batson<00:05:48.229> doll<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.740> uh

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.060 

you

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.120 

so<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.240> not<00:06:01.360> really<00:06:01.420> like<00:06:01.780> oh<00:06:02.320> I'm<00:06:02.650> taking<00:06:03.010> an

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
so it's not really like oh I'm taking an

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.920 
so it's not really like oh I'm taking an
account<00:06:03.520> what<00:06:03.730> you<00:06:03.850> have<00:06:04.000> behind<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:04.780> it's

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
account what you have behind it so it's

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.180 
account what you have behind it so it's
going<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.170> be<00:06:05.500> pretty<00:06:07.710> pretty<00:06:08.710> much<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.010> same

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
going to be pretty pretty much the same

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.030 
going to be pretty pretty much the same
across<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:09.670> amps<00:06:10.090> um<00:06:10.330> its<00:06:11.170> sister<00:06:11.560> over<00:06:11.800> here

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
across the amps um its sister over here

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.750 
across the amps um its sister over here
is<00:06:12.310> basically<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.210> same<00:06:14.460> circuit<00:06:15.460> through

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
is basically the same circuit through

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.710 
is basically the same circuit through
the<00:06:16.180> gang<00:06:16.390> structure<00:06:16.960> in<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:19.150> tone<00:06:19.390> stack

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
the gang structure in the the tone stack

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.260 
the gang structure in the the tone stack
but<00:06:20.110> without<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.920> clip<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.400> circuit<00:06:21.790> that's

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
but without the clip and circuit that's

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.460 
but without the clip and circuit that's
just<00:06:22.450> pegging<00:06:22.960> as<00:06:23.200> hard<00:06:23.440> as<00:06:23.560> it<00:06:23.680> can<00:06:23.710> so<00:06:24.640> um

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
just pegging as hard as it can so um

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.570 
just pegging as hard as it can so um
depending<00:06:26.470> on<00:06:26.590> what<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:26.890> put<00:06:27.040> in<00:06:27.220> front<00:06:27.340> of

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
depending on what you put in front of

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.000 
depending on what you put in front of
it's<00:06:27.820> gonna<00:06:28.030> piss<00:06:28.150> it<00:06:28.330> off<00:06:28.450> differently<00:06:29.010> well

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
it's gonna piss it off differently well

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:50.650 
it's gonna piss it off differently well
if<00:06:30.490> I<00:06:30.670> turn<00:06:30.850> it<00:06:31.030> up

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.420 

that's<00:06:51.660> as<00:06:52.050> sane<00:06:52.290> isn't<00:06:52.620> these<00:06:52.860> pedals<00:06:53.220> are

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
that's as sane isn't these pedals are

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.800 
that's as sane isn't these pedals are
that<00:06:53.820> isn't<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.120> only<00:06:54.180> thing<00:06:54.360> you've<00:06:54.570> been<00:06:54.690> up

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
chassis my brother-in-law did that for

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.230 
chassis my brother-in-law did that for
me<00:07:16.830> but<00:07:17.400> on<00:07:17.780> it's<00:07:18.780> fun<00:07:19.080> it's<00:07:19.290> uh<00:07:19.530> it's<00:07:20.150> sort<00:07:21.150> of

me but on it's fun it's uh it's sort of
plexi<00:07:21.630> based<00:07:21.840> on<00:07:22.550> through<00:07:23.550> like<00:07:23.700> some<00:07:23.880> of<00:07:23.970> the

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
plexi based on through like some of the

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.010 
plexi based on through like some of the
preamp<00:07:24.360> situations<00:07:25.050> but<00:07:25.400> I<00:07:26.630> pretty<00:07:27.630> much<00:07:27.720> went

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020
