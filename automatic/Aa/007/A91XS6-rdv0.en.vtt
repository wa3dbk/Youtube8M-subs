00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
and you know it was everything I dreamed

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.709 
and you know it was everything I dreamed
of<00:00:31.760> it<00:00:31.910> more<00:00:32.890> like<00:00:33.890> father<00:00:34.760> like<00:00:34.940> son<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
of it more like father like son the

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.779 
of it more like father like son the
apple<00:00:35.989> doesn't<00:00:36.230> fall<00:00:36.379> far<00:00:36.920> from<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.640> tree

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
apple doesn't fall far from the tree

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.619 
apple doesn't fall far from the tree
those<00:00:38.510> are<00:00:38.980> some<00:00:39.980> words<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:40.999> could<00:00:41.239> describe

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
those are some words that could describe

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.410 
those are some words that could describe
the<00:00:42.050> father-son<00:00:42.589> dynamic<00:00:43.059> but<00:00:44.059> there<00:00:44.300> are

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
the father-son dynamic but there are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.020 
the father-son dynamic but there are
major<00:00:44.960> differences<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.100> way<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:46.429> your

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
major differences in the way that your

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.430 
major differences in the way that your
characters<00:00:47.449> approach<00:00:47.809> things<00:00:48.109> can<00:00:48.409> you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
characters approach things can you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.049 
characters approach things can you
discuss<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.039> yeah<00:00:49.339> absolutely

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
discuss that yeah absolutely

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.239 
discuss that yeah absolutely
I<00:00:50.210> mean<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:51.050> mean<00:00:51.289> you're<00:00:51.469> right<00:00:51.649> they<00:00:51.829> are<00:00:51.979> they

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
I mean I mean you're right they are they

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.889 
I mean I mean you're right they are they
are<00:00:52.370> very<00:00:52.399> similar<00:00:52.879> people<00:00:53.179> in<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.510> lot<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.780> ways

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
are very similar people in a lot of ways

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.540 
are very similar people in a lot of ways
and<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.170> think<00:00:54.379> that's<00:00:54.530> where<00:00:54.769> some<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:55.429> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
and I think that's where some of the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.809 
and I think that's where some of the
conflict<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.179> tension<00:00:56.359> it<00:00:56.690> kind<00:00:57.289> of<00:00:57.819> arises

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
conflict and tension it kind of arises

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.719 
conflict and tension it kind of arises
because<00:00:59.289> you<00:01:00.289> know<00:01:00.379> they<00:01:00.739> they<00:01:01.039> kind<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.519> get

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
because you know they they kind of get

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.099 
because you know they they kind of get
into<00:01:01.879> these<00:01:02.059> arguments<00:01:02.389> and<00:01:02.659> whatever<00:01:02.839> and

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
into these arguments and whatever and

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.270 
into these arguments and whatever and
their<00:01:03.260> being<00:01:03.440> just<00:01:03.710> as<00:01:03.829> stubborn<00:01:04.070> as

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
their being just as stubborn as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.609 
their being just as stubborn as
bullheaded<00:01:04.579> as<00:01:04.939> each<00:01:05.089> other<00:01:05.329> and<00:01:05.600> hence<00:01:06.469> they

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
bullheaded as each other and hence they

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.190 
bullheaded as each other and hence they
kind<00:01:06.860> kind<00:01:07.009> of<00:01:07.130> figure<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.399> out<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:08.049> yeah<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
kind kind of figure it out but yeah the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.020 
kind kind of figure it out but yeah the
differences<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.860> lie<00:01:10.009> there<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.490> mean<00:01:10.640> Jack's

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
differences that lie there I mean Jack's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.740 
differences that lie there I mean Jack's
real<00:01:11.960> strategist<00:01:12.530> he's<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> planner<00:01:13.399> and<00:01:13.790> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
real strategist he's a planner and it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.389 
real strategist he's a planner and it
probably<00:01:15.200> started<00:01:15.680> as<00:01:15.799> something<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.280> he

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
probably started as something that he

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.039 
probably started as something that he
was<00:01:16.520> rebelling<00:01:16.850> against<00:01:17.270> his<00:01:17.420> father's<00:01:17.869> ways

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
was rebelling against his father's ways

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.510 
was rebelling against his father's ways
of<00:01:18.320> kind<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.770> going<00:01:18.920> about<00:01:19.159> things<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
of kind of going about things and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.219 
of kind of going about things and
winging<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.180> seeing<00:01:20.420> what<00:01:20.509> happens<00:01:20.960> and

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
winging it and seeing what happens and

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.529 
winging it and seeing what happens and
it's<00:01:22.100> interesting<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.670> see<00:01:22.820> those<00:01:23.000> two<00:01:23.270> kind

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
it's interesting to see those two kind

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.130 
it's interesting to see those two kind
of<00:01:23.630> styles<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:24.530> know<00:01:25.219> meld<00:01:25.549> together<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.360> you

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
of styles you know meld together and you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.080 
of styles you know meld together and you
know<00:01:27.259> see<00:01:27.500> them<00:01:27.649> having<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.920> work<00:01:28.100> together<00:01:28.310> to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
know see them having to work together to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.240 
know see them having to work together to
not<00:01:29.270> only<00:01:29.530> bust<00:01:30.530> out<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.859> there<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.039> stay

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
not only bust out of there and stay

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.499 
not only bust out of there and stay
alive<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:31.729> also<00:01:31.880> patch<00:01:32.180> up<00:01:32.390> their

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
alive but also patch up their

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.880 
alive but also patch up their
relationship<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.259> I<00:01:33.289> think<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.530> happens<00:01:33.799> in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
relationship and I think that happens in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.469 
relationship and I think that happens in
the<00:01:33.950> process<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.460> adds<00:01:35.210> an<00:01:35.359> interesting

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
the process it adds an interesting

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.830 
the process it adds an interesting
element<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.700> what<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.850> audiences<00:01:37.969> expect

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
element and what can audiences expect

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.959 
element and what can audiences expect
this<00:01:39.320> time<00:01:39.590> around<00:01:39.829> with<00:01:40.070> good<00:01:40.579> day<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.759> die

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
this time around with good day to die

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.520 
this time around with good day to die
hard<00:01:41.000> well<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.659> think<00:01:41.930> they<00:01:42.200> won't<00:01:42.380> be

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
hard well I think they won't be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.499 
hard well I think they won't be
disappointed<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.820> know<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.090> film<00:01:44.270> offers
