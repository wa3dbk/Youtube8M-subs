00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.730 

I<00:00:14.360> think<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> artists<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.080> play<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
raise the roof stayed there all very

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.599 
raise the roof stayed there all very
spirited<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.500> talented<00:00:19.740> musicians<00:00:20.430> they've

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
spirited very talented musicians they've

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279 
spirited very talented musicians they've
all<00:00:20.730> decided<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.449> sort<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.930> something<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
all decided to sort of do something a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.480 
all decided to sort of do something a
little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.529> different<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.039> their<00:00:23.130> music

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
little bit different with their music

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.070 
little bit different with their music
and<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> take<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.750> their<00:00:24.930> own

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and kind of take things down their own

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
and kind of take things down their own
path<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.769> they're<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.070> unique<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
path and they're very unique in that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
path and they're very unique in that
sense<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.109> interesting<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
sense so it can be really interesting to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:41.119 
sense so it can be really interesting to
see<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:29.510> I<00:00:38.420> almost<00:00:39.420> feel<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:40.020> alien<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
see how I almost feel like an alien that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
see how I almost feel like an alien that
was<00:00:41.309> left<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> planet<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.899> create<00:00:43.469> more

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
was left on this planet to create more

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
was left on this planet to create more
trombone<00:00:44.100> players<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> feel<00:00:45.030> like

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
trombone players that's what I feel like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600

is<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.539> mission<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> consider<00:00:47.129> ourselves<00:00:47.280> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
is my mission we I consider ourselves in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
is my mission we I consider ourselves in
Mavericks<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> average<00:00:48.480> brass<00:00:48.989> band

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
Mavericks because the average brass band

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
Mavericks because the average brass band
is<00:00:49.739> playing<00:00:50.129> stuff<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> already<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.030> horns

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is playing stuff that already has horns

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
is playing stuff that already has horns
in<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.230> never<00:00:52.410> play<00:00:52.710> songs<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
in it and we never play songs that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
in it and we never play songs that
already<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.820> horns<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.809> cover<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> song

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
already have horns and we cover a song

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
already have horns and we cover a song
it'll<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> song<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.610> he<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.629> never

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it'll be a song that he would never

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
it'll be a song that he would never
guess<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> brass<00:00:58.469> band<00:00:58.680> would<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.309> cover

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
guess a brass band would actually cover

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
guess a brass band would actually cover
for<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.480> people<00:01:00.960> who<00:01:01.160> don't<00:01:02.160> mind

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
for me it's about people who don't mind

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
for me it's about people who don't mind
kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> standing<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.390> doing<00:01:03.600> things

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kind of standing out for doing things

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.090

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
differently you know they might be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
differently you know they might be
influenced<00:01:05.700> by<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> specific<00:01:06.150> kind<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> music

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
influenced by a specific kind of music

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.840
