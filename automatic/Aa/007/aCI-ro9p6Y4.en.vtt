because<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.379> think<00:00:59.440> if<00:00:59.620> you'd<00:00:59.770> shown<00:01:00.039> me<00:01:00.309> spare

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
because I think if you'd shown me spare

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.209 
because I think if you'd shown me spare
parts<00:01:01.719> when<00:01:01.899> i<00:01:01.930> was<00:01:02.230> playing<00:01:02.680> gallagher<00:01:03.190> i

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
parts when i was playing gallagher i

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.550 
parts when i was playing gallagher i
would<00:01:03.430> have<00:01:03.550> thought<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.899> was<00:01:05.140> like<00:01:05.350> it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
would have thought that it was like it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.139 
would have thought that it was like it
was<00:01:05.770> science<00:01:05.950> fiction<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.640> see<00:01:06.789> something<00:01:07.000> as

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
was science fiction to see something as

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.850 
was science fiction to see something as
advanced<00:01:07.539> as<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:08.259> you<00:01:08.350> happens<00:01:08.680> very

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
advanced as that but you happens very

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.280 
advanced as that but you happens very
gradually<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.549> get<00:01:09.700> used<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.960> spare<00:01:10.960> parts

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
gradually so you get used to spare parts

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.870 
gradually so you get used to spare parts
is<00:01:11.409> great<00:01:11.680> for<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.070> for<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.369> fact<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.670> it's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
is great for it for the fact that it's

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
than falling backwards into each others

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.760 
than falling backwards into each others
arms<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.060> first<00:01:46.360> computer<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.409> think<00:01:47.619> of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
arms now the first computer you think of

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.580 
arms now the first computer you think of
is<00:01:48.250> obviously<00:01:48.640> Hal<00:01:48.880> 9000<00:01:49.600> because<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:50.470> know

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
is obviously Hal 9000 because you know

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.280 
is obviously Hal 9000 because you know
he's<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.310> most<00:01:51.490> iconic<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.600> artificial

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
he's the most iconic of the artificial

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.069 
he's the most iconic of the artificial
intelligences<00:01:53.920> out<00:01:54.100> there<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.299> yeah<00:01:55.450> setting

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
intelligences out there but yeah setting

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.410 
intelligences out there but yeah setting
off<00:01:56.200> from<00:01:56.560> from<00:01:57.070> square<00:01:57.399> one<00:01:57.430> with<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:58.060> was

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
off from from square one with this I was

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.810 
off from from square one with this I was
thinking<00:01:58.750> perhaps<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.530> little<00:02:00.340> bit<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.640> hell

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
thinking perhaps a little bit of hell

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.880 
thinking perhaps a little bit of hell
and<00:02:01.060> obviously<00:02:01.509> there's<00:02:01.750> mother<00:02:02.229> from<00:02:02.530> alien

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890

impossible<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.510> boost<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> signal<00:02:22.990> strength

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
impossible to boost the signal strength

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
I love the idea of rocket boots because

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.890 
I love the idea of rocket boots because
flying<00:02:54.650> would<00:02:54.890> be<00:02:55.010> great<00:02:55.219> fun<00:02:55.599> but<00:02:56.599> at<00:02:56.810> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
flying would be great fun but at the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.679 
flying would be great fun but at the
same<00:02:57.109> time<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.739> power<00:02:58.010> arms<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.730> know<00:02:58.849> I'm

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
same time the power arms you know I'm

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.059 
same time the power arms you know I'm
bet<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.079> move<00:03:00.230> house<00:03:00.469> they've<00:03:00.769> been<00:03:00.890> coming

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
bet to move house they've been coming

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.160 
bet to move house they've been coming
really<00:03:01.340> handy<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:01.790> lifting<00:03:02.060> boxes<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.719> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
really handy for lifting boxes and the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.959 
really handy for lifting boxes and the
x-ray<00:03:03.469> vision<00:03:03.739> obviously<00:03:04.129> you<00:03:04.549> know<00:03:04.670> for<00:03:04.849> any

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.910 
x-ray vision obviously you know for any
guy<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.569> always<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> boost<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.680> think

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
guy is always a boost but I think

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.379 
guy is always a boost but I think
probably<00:03:07.099> I'd<00:03:07.400> have<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.730> go<00:03:07.849> with<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.120> rocket

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
probably I'd have to go with the rocket
