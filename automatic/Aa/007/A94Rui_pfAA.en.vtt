00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.419 

and<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.410> segment<00:00:01.650> I'm<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> be

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
and in this segment I'm going to be

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.539 
and in this segment I'm going to be
using<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.689> scotch<00:00:04.049> brite<00:00:04.380> wheel<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.250> fine

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
using the scotch brite wheel in a fine

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.360 
using the scotch brite wheel in a fine
and<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.690> felt<00:00:06.960> wheel<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.740> my<00:00:07.919> jewel<00:00:08.160> tool

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and the felt wheel with my jewel tool

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.299 
and the felt wheel with my jewel tool
compiled<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.450> polish<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.440> bezel<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.040> this

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
compiled to polish the bezel of this

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.060 
compiled to polish the bezel of this
watch<00:00:14.089> I'll<00:00:15.089> start<00:00:16.049> off<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.830> Scotch

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
watch I'll start off with the Scotch

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.840 
watch I'll start off with the Scotch
right<00:00:17.400> fine<00:00:18.439> running<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.800> full<00:00:20.039> speed<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
right fine running it at full speed and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.359 
right fine running it at full speed and
as<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.590> marked<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> edges

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
as you can see I've marked the edges

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.019 
as you can see I've marked the edges
with<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.670> marker<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> great

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
with a marker now this is a great

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
with a marker now this is a great
technique<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.510> use<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:31.199> starting

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
technique to use when you're starting

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
technique to use when you're starting
off<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.460> sure<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.850> got<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> right

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
off just to make sure you got the right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.740 
off just to make sure you got the right
angle<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.680> bevel<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.270> where

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
angle of the bevel and you can see where

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.220 
angle of the bevel and you can see where
you're<00:00:36.960> touching<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.100> against<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> wheel

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
you're touching it up against the wheel

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:49.780 
you're touching it up against the wheel
so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> hold<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.829> here

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.790 

I'm<00:00:50.630> just<00:00:50.840> following<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:51.380> nice<00:00:51.590> flow

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.380 

you<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.090> nice

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.999 

and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> how

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
and then from here you see how

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.850 
and then from here you see how
beautifully<00:01:11.610> smooth<00:01:12.450> finish<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> achieve

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
beautifully smooth finish you achieve

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.600 
beautifully smooth finish you achieve
I'll<00:01:14.759> just<00:01:15.270> go<00:01:15.450> straight<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.500> felt<00:01:16.740> wheel

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.090 

applying<00:01:23.610> jewel<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> compound<00:01:25.100> liberally

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
applying jewel to a compound liberally

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:39.090 
applying jewel to a compound liberally
all<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:28.440> way<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.830> edge<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.479> polish

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.300 

keeping<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.580> nice<00:01:39.820> rocking<00:01:40.570> motion<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.950> what

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
keeping a nice rocking motion is what

00:01:42.310 --> 00:02:13.010 
keeping a nice rocking motion is what
you<00:01:42.460> want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.820> achieve

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.210 

then<00:02:14.020> we're<00:02:14.230> done<00:02:15.390> what's<00:02:16.390> nice<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.890> nice

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
then we're done what's nice is that nice

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.980 
then we're done what's nice is that nice
crisp<00:02:18.850> finish<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:21.190> still<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.750> like

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
crisp finish is still there just like

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.790 
crisp finish is still there just like
the<00:02:23.200> factory<00:02:23.650> polish<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.760> had<00:02:28.800> some

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
the factory polish now if this had some

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.590 
the factory polish now if this had some
grooves<00:02:30.160> here<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.880> high<00:02:31.060> polished

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
grooves here and this was high polished

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.950 
grooves here and this was high polished
I<00:02:31.960> would<00:02:32.620> easily<00:02:32.890> polish<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.690> green

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
I would easily polish it with the green

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.370 
I would easily polish it with the green
brush<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:36.040> green<00:02:36.370> brush<00:02:36.760> will<00:02:37.150> not<00:02:37.330> harm<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
brush the green brush will not harm the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.750 
brush the green brush will not harm the
crystal<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:39.520> any<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> detail<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.820> case

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
crystal or any of the detail of the case

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.060 
crystal or any of the detail of the case
there<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.880> go
