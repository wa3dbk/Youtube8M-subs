now you can make this full screen and I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
now you can make this full screen and I
always<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> layers<00:00:53.699> tab<00:00:53.730> open

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
always just have the layers tab open

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
always just have the layers tab open
because<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> most<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
because I use that most so now you can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.479 
because I use that most so now you can
do<00:00:56.309> shift<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.469> zoom<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
do shift and you can actually zoom in

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.330 
do shift and you can actually zoom in
right<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.160> the

right here so you can actually see the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240 
right here so you can actually see the
icon<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.559> basically<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
icon and this is just basically the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
icon and this is just basically the
first<00:01:05.400> step<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:06.390> ahead<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.659> go

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

and now this will give you the basic

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.719 
and now this will give you the basic
rounded<00:01:42.060> corners<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.189> icon<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.640> all

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
rounded corners for your icon it's all

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.920 
rounded corners for your icon it's all
right<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> upper<00:01:45.540> left

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
right up here we go to the upper left

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
right up here we go to the upper left
hand<00:01:46.020> corner<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.689> drag

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hand corner and you can actually drag

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.060 
hand corner and you can actually drag
from<00:01:49.439> left<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> right<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.680> let<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.860> go<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
from left to right and let that go and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
from left to right and let that go and
as<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.850> will<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.439> rounded

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
as you can see you will have rounded

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.740 
as you can see you will have rounded
edges<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.610> fill<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
edges so now you can fill that in with a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.889 
edges so now you can fill that in with a
color<00:01:58.049> by<00:01:58.409> hitting<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.149> bucket<00:02:00.149> fill<00:02:00.390> tool<00:02:00.420> or

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
color by hitting the bucket fill tool or

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.289 
color by hitting the bucket fill tool or
the<00:02:01.170> gradient<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> bend<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the gradient or you have the bend and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
the gradient or you have the bend and
gradient<00:02:03.960> tools<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.369> can

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
gradient tools so right here you can

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
gradient tools so right here you can
actually<00:02:06.240> pick<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.810> colors<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.380> I'll

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
actually pick what colors you want I'll

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.070 
actually pick what colors you want I'll
just<00:02:07.799> pick<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.039> green<00:02:08.640> color<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.539> basic

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just pick a green color for my basic

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.760 
just pick a green color for my basic
color

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
color

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.950 
color
my<00:02:10.980> second<00:02:11.370> color<00:02:11.550> I'll<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.090> pick<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> let's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
my second color I'll just pick a let's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.980 
my second color I'll just pick a let's
just<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> red<00:02:13.440> color<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.540> now<00:02:15.660> i'm<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
just do a red color so now i'm on the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.480 
just do a red color so now i'm on the
gradient<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.770> will<00:02:16.860> actually<00:02:17.010> make<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
gradient so it will actually make it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.550 
gradient so it will actually make it
fade<00:02:17.760> from<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.180> color<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> other<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.440> now

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
fade from one color to the other so now

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.200 
fade from one color to the other so now
you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:19.890> make<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> line<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
you can just make a line going up and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can just make a line going up and
it'll<00:02:21.630> actually<00:02:21.780> give<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> really<00:02:22.770> nice

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
it'll actually give you a really nice

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.550 
it'll actually give you a really nice
looking<00:02:23.250> icon<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:25.290> first

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
looking icon right here in the first

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
looking icon right here in the first
step<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.100> forgot<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.700> mention<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.330> when

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
step that i forgot to mention was when

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.210 
step that i forgot to mention was when
you<00:02:27.750> did<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> add<00:02:28.290> alpha<00:02:28.590> channel<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you did the add alpha channel that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
you did the add alpha channel that
actually<00:02:29.550> made<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> would

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
actually made it so now you would

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.970 
actually made it so now you would
actually<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:33.110> transparent<00:02:34.110> corners<00:02:34.560> so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
actually have the transparent corners so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually have the transparent corners so
you<00:02:35.040> could<00:02:35.490> actually<00:02:35.640> see<00:02:36.210> through<00:02:36.420> those

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
you could actually see through those

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.360 
you could actually see through those
corners<00:02:37.080> when<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.470> actually<00:02:37.650> put<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> icon

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
corners when you actually put the icon

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
corners when you actually put the icon
on<00:02:38.550> your<00:02:38.580> device<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.990> right<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
on your device so right here now that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.410 
on your device so right here now that
you<00:02:40.740> have<00:02:40.770> your<00:02:40.860> icon<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.300> like

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you have your icon so if you don't like

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.760 
you have your icon so if you don't like
that<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.960> actually<00:02:43.080> make<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> new<00:02:43.590> one

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
that you can actually make a new one

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920 
that you can actually make a new one
just<00:02:44.280> change<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.790> color<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.660> look

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
just change this color so now this look

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.120 
just change this color so now this look
actually<00:02:46.080> pretty<00:02:46.410> cool<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.010> both

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
actually pretty cool because it's both

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.870 
actually pretty cool because it's both
greens<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.390> looks<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.930> decent<00:02:49.740> icon<00:02:50.250> now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
greens so looks like a decent icon now

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400 
greens so looks like a decent icon now
if<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.210> want<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.630> go<00:02:51.690> ahead<00:02:51.960> put<00:02:52.200> some

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
if you want you can go ahead put some

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.140 
if you want you can go ahead put some
text<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:56.120> say<00:02:57.120> I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
text on here just go like this say I

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.050 
text on here just go like this say I
just<00:02:57.500> write<00:02:58.500> fishy<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.520> looks<00:02:59.550> pretty<00:02:59.850> cool

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
just write fishy so it looks pretty cool

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.490 
just write fishy so it looks pretty cool
it<00:03:00.360> doesn't<00:03:00.600> look<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.720> good<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:01.260> but

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it doesn't look that good right now but

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
it doesn't look that good right now but
once<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.800> zoom<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.580> put<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.820> your<00:03:02.850> vows

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
once you zoom out and put on your vows

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.550 
once you zoom out and put on your vows
that<00:03:03.150> looks<00:03:03.450> actually<00:03:03.600> pretty<00:03:03.780> sweet<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.440> now

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
that looks actually pretty sweet so now

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.030 
that looks actually pretty sweet so now
again<00:03:05.130> hold<00:03:05.580> Shift<00:03:05.970> +<00:03:06.240> +<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.350> zoom<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.980> can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
again hold Shift + + to zoom in you can

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
again hold Shift + + to zoom in you can
just<00:03:08.340> push<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> minus<00:03:08.970> sign<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.270> zoom<00:03:09.450> out<00:03:09.570> so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
just push the minus sign to zoom out so

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.590 
just push the minus sign to zoom out so
this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.190> basically<00:03:11.310> how<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> simple

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
this is basically how you make a simple

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020 
this is basically how you make a simple
I<00:03:12.840> phone<00:03:13.110> icon<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.620> GIMP<00:03:13.920> guys<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.460> would<00:03:14.850> make

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
I phone icon with GIMP guys I would make

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.880 
I phone icon with GIMP guys I would make
one<00:03:15.240> with<00:03:15.390> Photoshop<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.140> there's<00:03:16.320> already

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
one with Photoshop but there's already

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.400 
one with Photoshop but there's already
so<00:03:17.490> many<00:03:17.550> videos<00:03:18.270> on<00:03:18.450> YouTube<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.170> make

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
so many videos on YouTube on how to make
