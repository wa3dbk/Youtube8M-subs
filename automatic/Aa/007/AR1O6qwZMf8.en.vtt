00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.545
 You live alone, 

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:52.765
 away from everything, 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.882
 Stop over ... 

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:58.562
 the roof of the world. 

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:04.929
 I have always had 

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:09.233
 an eye on you 

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:14.898
 When the night ... 

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:21.249
 wrap the city, 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.921
 It's when they will die ... 

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:33.297
 hopes. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.945
 I have always had 

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:45.141
 an eye on you 

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:50.860
 When the night ... 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.603
 wrap the city. 

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:27.613
 At the corner of a street I took your hand, 

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:30.457
 to show you the blue lights ... 

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.456
 and chase the shadows that escape. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.944
 At the corner of a street I took your hand, 

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.765
 never to let go ... 

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:44.566
 and together we run like crazy ... 

00:02:47.058 --> 00:02:48.599
 in the dark alleys.
