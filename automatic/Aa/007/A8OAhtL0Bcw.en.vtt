00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello friends with you amway 921 and in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.870
 in this form we will talk about such 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.730
 rare and promotional even soviet 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.460
 premium level five heavy tank 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.460
 if literally in a few words to write it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 then it is the heaviest and the most 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 medium armored tank 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 that is, level five is stronger than a tank 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.880
 you will find it not only because 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 true that has extremely weak guns 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 It also has a preferential level of fighting 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.110
 only tanks will fire on it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 fifth to sixth level but not higher but lower 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 even up to the fact that troechki 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 there are also some of us may be swung bzyn 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.690
 which is what is different gameplay 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.010
 medium heavy tank spheres from 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 highest levels 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.850
 yes even if it is here when 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440
 The first time someone does not pierce you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 the second shot he does not charge 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 some kind of subcaliber or cumulative 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 Here everything happens as if it is warm and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.300
 lamp in the very tanks that when 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 then I came here and armor there 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 really cast here is often 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
 there are very few who play only 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.049
 head for example tanks from medium 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.580
 levels 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.130
 that is, you can really fun 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 tank and that's it exactly such a thing 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 probably not applicable to senior level 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.920
 well, here it is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.890
 and still curious what once was 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.650
 the time when the apt-220 was the rarest straight 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 tank level five even in beta tester 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 skie square 220 m on its number recompress 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 but in the recent past there was such an action 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.009
 if you remember she was pretty 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.290
 difficult where it was necessary for 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.240
 months almost every day to fill 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 a certain number of digits by color 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.890
 damage to him there something I really don't remember but 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 nevertheless since then these tanks 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.430
 significantly increased in the random 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.049
 the last time I did this 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.799
 tank video it was about six months 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.079
 back then they were in the randomness but 13800 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.270
 not their say but the owners of these tanks and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.909
 that is, there are so many people bought 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.570
 him and once the battle passed them right now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.369
 became 76 thousand three hundred that is for half a year 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 population but i think it was especially 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.079
 connected with this action increased 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.479
 significantly several times that is it 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.459
 let's say tank he did not become the most 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.380
 rare he became such a third 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.700
 popularity but 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.500
 yet it is far of course not often 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.630
 is found in randomness especially on 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.580
 medium levels where it plays like a very 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.880
 many tankers there let's say 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.930
 its even less per capita 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.940
 returns the same to the tank itself 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 It is definitely worth saying that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 without gold neither tudes nor syudy 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.320
 This is the case because 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.900
 ninety nine millimeters 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.730
 Grandma's armor penetration is not even 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.770
 funny we are some classmates 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 impenetrable such as for example kv-1 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.730
 stanin to me somehow absolutely diamond 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.560
 Golda would even it is unlikely to be struck 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.050
 but nevertheless he shot at me 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.030
 blow mines a chance not to damage him 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.160
 whether to minimize risks and 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.620
 because haircut has just started counting 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 49 I wanted to destroy him already 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.050
 faster 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.700
 as little as possible with losses therefore 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.160
 was forced to shoot golda which 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.590
 breaks 21 mm with her even though 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.540
 somehow you can live she saves but the truth 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.830
 what not always hide some 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 sixes you even gold 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.110
 they do not punch what places no matter how they are 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.390
 to substitute but there is any information 2 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.550
 twenty nine hundredths accuracy only 46 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.500
 too damn cannon definitely for 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.270
 melee aim and there 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.640
 something very difficult what 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.400
 characteristic and nice in this cannon down 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.320
 she bends jealously 8 degrees these 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.600
 convenient to use and all that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.910
 regarding the tank itself, it is so 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.860
 huge that miss the opponent on it 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.810
 can not pleases that in this battle 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.330
 especially when i destroy kv-1 by me 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.760
 everybody who starts to suffer 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.110
 Well, as I do not even know how to get me 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.540
 so that it does not break through 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.100
 he builds the bad guys fortunately and just 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 thanks to this guy who is so not 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.900
 here first killings can not be, I'll take 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.030
 at the end of the battle a significant handful 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.730
 from a tank of battered damage on 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.980
 another thing is that my skill is true here 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.580
 does not smell merit is not in it but merit 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.530
 probably 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.630
 and it is in the tanks itself what else 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.330
 characteristic of apt-220 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.690
 you need to take in every battle 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.690
 these are the rules or you are driving or not 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.150
 there is no such mean here that 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.280
 I mean, it's a one-way tank. 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.709
 if you went on it that is to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.600
 the end and david the very last 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.430
 because you no longer have time to return 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.530
 if the base will capture this first 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.310
 the second if you do not go then stay 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.290
 Any card for example in 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.910
 near the flag because it never starts 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.220
 seizure of our base you at least success 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.919
 return but somewhere in the middle man 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.350
 chintz this should not be in tambov 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.990
 just clicked sneakers on the floor and just pru 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.760
 on the enemy beating off everything that flies through me 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.410
 once all low level babies there 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.419
 but , as you can see , here 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.000
 some success four bodies 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.540
 already counted in the counter well it is not yet 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.210
 evening 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.130
 oh yeah i have n't told you yet about the review 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.470
 that is, you spend 10 meters 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.300
 there is nothing to tell well that is important 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.669
 understand that without a pipe in the first battle 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.190
 it's not worth it to go because you 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.500
 don't see anyone at all and if you will 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.389
 play aggressively then 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.040
 possible and with this review it will be possible 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.080
 handle especially when for example 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.210
 the battle of this map is everything in general 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.820
 from around the corner see with see through 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.340
 ok generally let's say a tank class 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.020
 which is exactly what occupies kv-220 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.030
 can be described in one word 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.160
 who once vova gleborg came up 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.100
 but it was very subtly noticed with his 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.979
 side of a class of games like Hodor 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.950
 the motives of the game of thrones you drive yourself right 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.229
 month of all who you see no doubt in 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.479
 you have no doubt whatsoever and in anything 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.910
 destroy everything just and no way 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.620
 all other attempts that I used to 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.410
 undertook for example at apt-220 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.330
 trying to play master just yes with 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.160
 moment of the last video as half a year for you 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.860
 and I did not sit down on the tank and the master 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.720
 I didn’t have it and I somehow didn’t man 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.940
 understood what the problem was trying to but 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.150
 it is killed then something else because 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.220
 played something mean you must choose 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.860
 all the same iterators and based on or 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.630
 there is a forward like projection and here in this fight 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.260
 finally i did all that the doctor 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.080
 prescribed 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.120
 and notice how many bodies have already been laid 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.639
 beauty well, in general, what am i doing this to you 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.270
 telling that my friends have passed 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.150
 couple 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.250

 will cost I don't know honestly but 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.220
 its value in gold is one and a half thousand in 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.870
 depending on the availability of the slot from 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.419
