00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Welcome to the tour of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 aidamar the ninth is that yes 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.130
 meanwhile and in comparison to the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 predecessor steffen has not so much 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.490
 For example, this is always changed 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.580
 Snakes are in front of the market restaurant 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 addex wise covering 9 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
 Here we go that market 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.310
 restaurant is in the style of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 name already says a market designed 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 with different stalls and that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 is really beautiful is not designed 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 everything as healthy as the fruit and if 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 you go out there then you come in the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.450
 area where the shops are where I go to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 example jewelry get where I remember 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.320
 get where i get alcohol and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 then it goes on to the art gallery 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 the pictures are always with actions 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.350
 then also auctioned off pictures of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.719
 kiss mouth artist felix büttner and then 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 as in the theatrium, that works 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.039
 Over three decks is such an open one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.719
 theater with a stage where you have the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.850
 move all elements up and down 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.420
 can be very interesting around it any amount 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 bars or even the vinothek there 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 there is wine to drink quite clearly though 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 also a classic game 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 for in between studio aida 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.270
 Here is the weekly video cut 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 and from there will be the daily aida 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.799
 TV broadcast sent next to it I can out 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.299
 book flight 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.400
 and if we go further then 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.400
 Seeing then we come, for example, in the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.869
 aida was the bar with the huge 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.270
 long counter and how will that be 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.150
 Realized by this counter easy 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.130
 zigzag is built like and since 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 I then drink something costs everything 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.579
 money is not all inclusive both 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.079
 this is the casino i can contact 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.479
 vending machines also with the boarding pass 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.159
 so pay does not need cash and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.140
 there is this machine yes i have 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.670
 as a child always loved though the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.110
 chances of winning because are rather low yes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.579
 but maybe helps clear seegang 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.229
 that the coins fall under it 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 Continue to the lounge 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 Library in the front of the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.549
 ship yes and evil tongues could 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.439
 now claim why did they because there 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.880
 frosted glass installed but it was only at the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.020
 day so much that you can not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 could but could get by 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 a pretty cozy one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.439
 place as it goes to the photo gallery 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 is not digital but will be here 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.049
 actually only paper photos issued 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.340
 and this is the café mare here i can 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.500
 drink a cappuccino 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.650
 in between if I want that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.480
 or something high percentage does not matter 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.300
 next to it is the café los steakhouse 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.610
 since I order and pay á la carte 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.510
 is a not so cheap pleasure 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.680
 It goes on in the brewery that is yes 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.400
 a bit of our style 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 designed beer garden and here I have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.470
 eat that is served me for free 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.990
 and at the bella donna restaurant there 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.459
 There is a big buffet restaurant 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.170
 Mediterranean cuisine Italian 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.480
 focus and afternoon before all 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 Unfortunately hire cake I so 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.790
 Mediocre but okay and everything 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.310
 beautiful in the market restaurant bella donna 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.630
 restaurant i can sit outside because 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.580
 is a warm enough is in the east 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.000
 There is Asian cuisine or restaurant 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.600
 but also suzuki only against 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.940
 The Rossini is a wonderful prize 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.980
 extra price restaurant costs about 30 euros 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.170
 depending on how many gears I take and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.770
 There is exquisite cuisine in California 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.440
 There are rapeseed and bagels and whole 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.180
 of course, also delicious burger with 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.750
 pommes breathe in between 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 there are the citizens so that's that 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 Of course, pooldeck is not like that now 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.000
 great in this weather the pools 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.250
 are not really that huge on the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.220
 adidas but I mean to refresh 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.630
 it is enough these figures here are 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.079
 also quite nicely designed you can even 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.049
 get to know women yes that looks too 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.220
 comfortable from those are these are there 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.870
 I can watch TV, for example 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.480
 if i have a place the 4d cinema 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.040
 we have here and then just to 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.380
 example, a possibility for 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.380
 billiards play or to play pinball 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.330
 and continue on deck 11 ins 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.040
 gym was not like that 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.900
 Often to find that is what it is 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.360
 here a spinning with a screen 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.100
 and I can only diverse landscapes 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.110
 experienced and the best is the cost 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.700
 no extra charge yes who would have that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.400
 but of course I think so too 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.100
 spinning in group doing in 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.290
 This course area is very generous 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.790
 is designed it continues in spa 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.410
 I can get treatment there but 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.870
 I can also go in for 20 euros a day 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.340
 This wellness oasis you have to 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.260
 consider if it is worth the value I have 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.820
 that never done so far and still 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.250
 once a view of the pool deck 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.810
 This time, the upper part so to speak, because 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.760
 you can make yourself comfortable 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.160
 there is a bit more going on there but it 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.450
 Also in the back of the ship 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.510
 is a cause in the front area 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.220
 the ship is a little quieter yes 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.940
 And at the very end we still have the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.890
 anytime bar 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.660
 that's the disco on board yes I hope 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.760
 this fast run has you 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.560
 fallen over the old lady there is only 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.760
 still so much to discover on the ship 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.490
 and that's why I have many 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.530
 other videos made about the one so 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.380
