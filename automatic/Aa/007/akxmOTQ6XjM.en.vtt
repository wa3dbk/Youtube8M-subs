00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.379
 the girls cause to see that the collective 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.990
 it's some little things the future 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.780

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.020
 teach is this 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.350
 it's a pretty simple cream says sir 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.750
 but other than that it's pretty simple it's 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.700
 his person then look and there would be enough 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.540
 and then I bought this other champagne 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.890
 that I already have this is this 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:45.130
 and eating is plate with black and I the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:49.750
 I bought in plots because I compared myself 90 x 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.350
 my name is another white because I eat 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.040

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.040
 I bought this one 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.269
 that the street is super is too rich 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 It's like this cloth 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.170
 posture soft hairs and there would be 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.270
 too 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.370
 another thing is very similar to the last 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.850
 txanpa was this cardio 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:27.060
 that this villain villains that the chamba 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:30.820
 it's so super loose and it's the material 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.640
 the suns or something cool like clothes and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.620
 sleeves and pain 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.380
 and it's a super casual loose style 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 a lot so we take a pole this 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.220
 change and is super hot after 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.770
 kicked me I bought my bought me 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.440
 in hua hin because there are many people 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 then and if I lose weight or what but 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.110
 I do not have jeans very well and where 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.690
 be and that is blue super always also 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.020
 They have as they are these details 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.270
 brown fat brown and so on and speaking 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 of cato I am perfect but perfect 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.050
 for my body to green that many 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.570
 challenges is where the end with local 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.900
 I do not think they like them all but they are 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.090
 you and this one like take it with 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.090
 this 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.030
 with that style like that is not called 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.950
 holographic I think it changes color and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.069
 It does not know the natural ways a time and not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.810
 they think it a lot because it's already cold 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.080
 purchase that your councilors buy as 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.459
 suffered but I love them and the summer 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.790
 they will be all the time to put 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.010
 well then buy clothes I think it was 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.470
 this coat that is looking for a coat 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.239
 like that leather motor and someone that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.989
 style programming time and never 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.790
 I found none of the leather but it was not 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.790
 what I wanted and in this one 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.700
 and is that these days help you 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.069

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.150
 know how to indicate the hair editor is another 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.150
 very different thing so it's super 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.709
 versatile and jazz imagining they see all the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.709
