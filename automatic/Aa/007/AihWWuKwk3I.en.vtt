00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.850
 I always count on the initial whistle 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.840
 until the last drop of blood 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.540
 the gain of silence and certainness of the poem and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.640
 sum sometimes constitution and other 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.690
 times tree so many times balance 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.620
 other inmates have been is ours 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 memory is a mystery 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.130
 I remember a wonderful song that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.100
 there never was one in which I can distinguish 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 with clarity the faults 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:28.040
 the violins the oboe the dream in extra 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.430
 always only the living in the edible 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.270
 for the subway quotes doubt and load 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.260
 dazzled with the pupils 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.050
 I am between empty and fullness in your 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.900
 hands like fragility is a bird 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 knows and distracted, if it aligns in the heart and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:54.729
 It feeds on love and Ã‡amora upon 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.729
 angel well upon suffering 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.800
 count me always floors same stones 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.890
 Portuguese and recommends in the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.090
 currency in which I know you 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.989
 With you I want to celebrate old days and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.340
 days where you live with tics leaving 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:44.610
 and also my hunger but above all 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.950
 shall divide and be indivisible 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.860
 I pulsed where I was 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.480
 Do you know my name? I'll be there. 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.730
 when no one is ever with you 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 when the decisive time comes and not 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:08.620
 find more haste as soon as possible 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:11.280
 awesome courage your grandfather frate camera 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.700
 certain forces or bars 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.500
 but the phrase also a clean sun that 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.190
 integrate both hands and attaching it 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.870
 between the faithful answers to the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.299
 more humble 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.600
 I want to say of the wisest and the most 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.540
 always count on me
