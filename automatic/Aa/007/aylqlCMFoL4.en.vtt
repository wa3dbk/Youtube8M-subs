00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.180 

to<00:04:25.180> speak<00:04:25.450> up<00:04:25.570> around<00:04:25.810> everything<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.380> just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
to speak up around everything I just

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.610 
to speak up around everything I just
it's<00:04:28.030> just<00:04:28.120> rocking<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.780> mean<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:28.990> think<00:04:29.170> it's<00:04:29.500> an

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
it's just rocking I mean I think it's an

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.730 
it's just rocking I mean I think it's an
anomaly<00:04:29.860> i<00:04:30.100> think<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.320> there's<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.530> lot

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
anomaly i think that there's not a lot

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.290 
anomaly i think that there's not a lot
of<00:04:32.770> guitar<00:04:33.100> players<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.580> are<00:04:33.700> jamming<00:04:34.150> like

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
of guitar players that are jamming like

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.600 
of guitar players that are jamming like
us<00:04:34.480> at<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:34.750> point<00:04:35.050> i<00:04:35.170> think<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:35.590> we<00:04:35.740> are

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
us at this point i think that we are

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.060 
us at this point i think that we are
very<00:04:36.940> very<00:04:37.000> retro<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.500> goes<00:04:38.680> back<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.920> a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
very very retro and it goes back to a

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.260 
very very retro and it goes back to a
place<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.860> know<00:04:41.920> where<00:04:42.190> everybody<00:04:42.940> was

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
place of you know where everybody was

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.720 
place of you know where everybody was
more<00:04:43.570> freeform<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.890> enjoying<00:04:45.310> each<00:04:45.520> other

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
more freeform and enjoying each other

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.190 
more freeform and enjoying each other
and<00:04:46.030> actually<00:04:46.270> having<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.810> musical

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
and actually having a musical

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.030 
and actually having a musical
conversation<00:04:47.770> much<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.760> jazz<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.950> know

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
conversation much like jazz and you know

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040 
conversation much like jazz and you know
the<00:04:54.220> anomaly<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.900> know<00:04:55.930> I

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050
