many<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.570> us<00:00:03.659> can<00:00:03.870> say<00:00:03.899> I've<00:00:04.830> never<00:00:04.980> had<00:00:05.130> an

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
many of us can say I've never had an

many of us can say I've never had an
accident<00:00:05.460> before<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.029> I've<00:00:06.120> been<00:00:06.240> driving

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
accident before and I've been driving

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.440 
accident before and I've been driving
this<00:00:06.629> way<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:06.990> years<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.859> must<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.099> fine

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
this way for years so it must be fine

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.640 
this way for years so it must be fine
but<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.870> us<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.200> reason<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.500> haven't

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
but for some of us the reason we haven't

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.049 
but for some of us the reason we haven't
had<00:00:10.830> an<00:00:10.920> accident<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.790> matter<00:00:11.969> of

collision<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.380> never<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the

risk factors working against us

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.789 
risk factors working against us
that's<00:01:19.680> why<00:01:19.979> drivers<00:01:20.549> need<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:22.049> they

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that's why drivers need to know how they

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
that's why drivers need to know how they
could<00:01:23.040> develop<00:01:23.220> habits<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
could develop habits that are going to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.620 
could develop habits that are going to
give<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.950> risk<00:01:26.280> management

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
give them that risk management

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
give them that risk management
capabilities<00:01:27.710> we<00:01:28.710> can't<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.189> anything<00:01:29.549> about

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
capabilities we can't do anything about

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
capabilities we can't do anything about
all<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.180> drivers<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.170> we

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
all the other drivers out there but we

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.190 
all the other drivers out there but we
could<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> something<00:01:32.070> about<00:01:32.130> ourselves<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
could do something about ourselves and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.590 
could do something about ourselves and
that<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:35.100> empower<00:01:35.670> ourselves<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.450> some

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that is to empower ourselves with some

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.679 
that is to empower ourselves with some
pretty<00:01:36.840> good<00:01:36.930> habits<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.540> into

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
pretty good habits so when I get into

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
pretty good habits so when I get into
the<00:01:39.780> car<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.290> remind<00:01:40.860> myself<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.520> habits

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the car I just remind myself of habits

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810 
the car I just remind myself of habits
that<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> habits<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.520> was

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that I have one of the habits that was

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.999 
that I have one of the habits that was
real<00:01:45.090> hard<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> break<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.350> tailgating

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
real hard for me to break was tailgating

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.130 
real hard for me to break was tailgating
you<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.970> forget<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.540> tailgating

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you I just forget that I'm tailgating

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
you I just forget that I'm tailgating
I'm<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> hurry<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> cars<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.460> moving<00:01:50.790> fast

I'm in a hurry the cars not moving fast

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.429 
I'm in a hurry the cars not moving fast
enough<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> front<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.689> me<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.079> up<00:01:52.229> there

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
enough in front of me and I get up there

enough in front of me and I get up there
probably<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> single<00:01:53.790> best<00:01:54.329> thing<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
do is give yourself enough space between

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.889 
do is give yourself enough space between
you<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> car<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.119> front<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
assume they're not going to do the right

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.469 
assume they're not going to do the right
thing<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> make<00:01:59.670> sure<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.329> place

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
to go make sure you have enough room
enough<00:02:02.250> space<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> stop<00:02:03.079> without<00:02:04.079> hitting<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
enough space to stop without hitting the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
enough space to stop without hitting the
car<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.829> front<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> enough<00:02:05.939> space<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> slow

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
car in front of you enough space to slow

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.119 
car in front of you enough space to slow
down<00:02:06.659> gradually<00:02:06.719> before<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> stop<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
down gradually before you stop so you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.619 
down gradually before you stop so you

and you haven't seen it and you'll have
enough<00:02:24.060> time<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.390> react<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> because<00:02:25.440> you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
enough time to react to it because you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.720 
enough time to react to it because you
couldn't<00:02:25.830> see<00:02:25.950> around<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.250> vehicle<00:02:26.640> in
