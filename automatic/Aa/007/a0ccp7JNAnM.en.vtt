00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
create<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:11.849> application<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.509> uses<00:00:12.719> an<00:00:12.929> RSS

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
create an application that uses an RSS

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.440 
create an application that uses an RSS
feed<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.950> enables<00:00:14.759> us<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.179> further

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
feed and enables us to get further

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.060 
feed and enables us to get further
detail<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.320> table<00:00:16.500> view<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:16.980> we

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
detail from a table view when we

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
detail from a table view when we
actually<00:00:17.220> select<00:00:17.699> an<00:00:17.820> item<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.720> let's<00:00:18.869> get

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
actually select an item so let's get

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
actually select an item so let's get
started<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.800> adding<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.310> RSS<00:00:20.789> feed<00:00:20.820> from

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
started with it I go back to a data

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.860 
started with it I go back to a data
repository<00:01:22.570> get<00:01:23.570> our<00:01:23.659> title<00:01:25.510> drag<00:01:26.510> that<00:01:26.690> in

repository get our title drag that in

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.450 
repository get our title drag that in
now<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.410> can<00:01:27.530> see<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.770> we're<00:01:28.010> at<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.160> moment

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
now you can see that we're at the moment

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.240 
now you can see that we're at the moment
where<00:01:28.580> organized<00:01:29.120> alphabetically<00:01:30.190> for<00:01:31.190> an

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
where organized alphabetically for an

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.859 
where organized alphabetically for an
RSS<00:01:31.700> feed<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:32.119> doesn't<00:01:32.450> really<00:01:32.630> make<00:01:32.810> a

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
RSS feed this doesn't really make a

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.870 
RSS feed this doesn't really make a
whole<00:01:33.050> lot<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.229> sense<00:01:33.500> because<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.610> want<00:01:34.790> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
whole lot of sense because you want to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.760 
whole lot of sense because you want to
see<00:01:35.030> things<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.600> order<00:01:35.810> they<00:01:35.990> appear<00:01:36.050> date

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
see things in the order they appear date

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.530 
see things in the order they appear date
wise<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.250> we'll<00:01:37.400> take<00:01:37.580> off<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.060> group

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
wise so we'll take off that group

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.810 
wise so we'll take off that group
alphabetically<00:01:39.350> option<00:01:39.710> let's<00:01:40.430> turn<00:01:40.640> that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
alphabetically option let's turn that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.930 
alphabetically option let's turn that
off<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.860> there's<00:01:42.860> our<00:01:42.979> basic<00:01:43.369> main<00:01:43.550> screen

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
off and there's our basic main screen

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.030 
off and there's our basic main screen
now<00:01:44.630> obviously<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.290> select<00:01:45.470> an<00:01:45.710> item<00:01:45.800> in

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
now obviously when we select an item in

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.980 
now obviously when we select an item in
this<00:01:46.160> table<00:01:46.460> view<00:01:46.759> we're<00:01:47.630> going<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.840> want<00:01:47.930> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
this table view we're going to want to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.389 
this table view we're going to want to
find<00:01:48.200> out<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> little<00:01:48.619> bit<00:01:48.800> more<00:01:49.009> detail<00:01:49.369> about

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
find out a little bit more detail about

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.870 
find out a little bit more detail about
it<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.360> that's<00:01:50.509> what<00:01:50.660> we'll<00:01:50.720> do<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:52.789> we'll

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
it so that's what we'll do now so we'll

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.490 
it so that's what we'll do now so we'll
create<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.149> new<00:01:53.300> view<00:01:55.030> here<00:01:56.030> we<00:01:56.119> go<00:01:56.380> we'll<00:01:57.380> give

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
create a new view here we go we'll give

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.260 
create a new view here we go we'll give
it<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.649> navigation<00:01:58.220> bar<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.789> back<00:01:59.000> button

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
it a navigation bar and a back button

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.359 
it a navigation bar and a back button
and<00:01:59.740> we'll<00:02:00.740> call<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:02.320> use<00:02:03.320> detail<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:07.280> we

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
and we'll call that use detail and we

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.029 
and we'll call that use detail and we
might<00:02:07.490> just<00:02:07.700> call<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.030> view<00:02:08.420> name<00:02:09.039> use

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
might just call that view name use

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.550 
might just call that view name use
detail<00:02:10.459> as<00:02:10.610> well<00:02:15.820> okay<00:02:17.050> now<00:02:18.050> obviously<00:02:18.380> what

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
detail as well okay now obviously what

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
detail as well okay now obviously what
we<00:02:18.650> want<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.830> do<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.220> add<00:02:19.519> some<00:02:19.730> placeholders

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
typewriter easy now how do we link that

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.530 
typewriter easy now how do we link that
to<00:03:07.340> what<00:03:07.459> we<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:07.579> selected<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.150> table

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
to what we just selected on the table

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.650 
to what we just selected on the table
view<00:03:09.340> well<00:03:10.340> let's<00:03:10.489> get<00:03:10.670> started<00:03:11.060> by<00:03:11.120> wiring<00:03:11.480> it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
view well let's get started by wiring it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.880 
view well let's get started by wiring it
up<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.959> when<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.200> select<00:03:12.440> something<00:03:12.769> on

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
up so that when we select something on

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.949 
up so that when we select something on
the<00:03:12.980> table<00:03:13.130> view<00:03:13.430> we<00:03:13.820> show<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.209> detail<00:03:14.690> view

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the table view we show that detail view

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.510 
the table view we show that detail view
so<00:03:15.500> they<00:03:15.590> go<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:15.799> table<00:03:16.190> view

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.390 

just<00:03:19.270> there<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.320> we<00:03:20.410> go<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.590> our<00:03:20.680> actions<00:03:21.130> you

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
just there and we go to our actions you

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.100 
just there and we go to our actions you
can<00:03:21.550> see<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.910> there's<00:03:22.150> an<00:03:22.570> action<00:03:22.900> called

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
can see that there's an action called

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.080 
can see that there's an action called
touchdown<00:03:23.650> now<00:03:24.370> obviously<00:03:24.670> want<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.940> ring

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
touchdown now obviously want to ring

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.110 
touchdown now obviously want to ring
that<00:03:25.120> ring<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.780> up<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.050> news<00:03:26.290> detail<00:03:27.120> so

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
that ring that up to the news detail so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.050 
that ring that up to the news detail so
that<00:03:28.150> loads<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.250> make<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> slide<00:03:30.790> left

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
that loads that you make that slide left

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.430 
that loads that you make that slide left
would<00:03:31.240> be<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.510> most<00:03:31.630> logical<00:03:31.780> thing<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.200> do

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
would be the most logical thing to do

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
would be the most logical thing to do
right<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.710> table<00:03:36.040> view<00:03:36.190> has<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.060> selected

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
right now the table view has a selected

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.120 
right now the table view has a selected
item<00:03:37.990> which<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.410> see<00:03:38.590> down<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> project

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
