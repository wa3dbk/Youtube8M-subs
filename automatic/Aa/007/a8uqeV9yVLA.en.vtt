00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.999
 for my dark sheldon ancestors it was clearly a curse that the 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.609
 condemned a kind of spiritual purgatory but because they endeavored to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.720
 seal so tightly this camera perhaps the bolt did not pretend 

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.199
 keep intruders out if you do not lock something inside 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.730
 that basted state of balance 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 a rebel soldier 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.930
 what is this 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.360
 I was not scheduled 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.820
 they have wanted it on Saturdays 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.140
 A) Yes 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.320
 sony instead of one of your ancestors 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 an achievement because finally the answer is that no 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.270
 you do not have to say anything I know your mind 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.180
 you are looking for 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.890
 next to your rosary creature 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 being able to offer network speeds 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 found the body of Carlos a 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.590
 the work will go to the cathedral of hell to look for the heart of the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 darkness 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 God knows what is there 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.560
 this means 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 because they should trust their prophecies 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.480
 of your events are already written 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.100
 just as they feared 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700
 but still a while 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.870
 can be stopped 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.730
 If the student is in flames Brazil is five centuries out of my reach 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 I can also help you in that respect 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.130
 the former of fort 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.180
 arrived at the same time 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.920
 the tent to war 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 this task has to perform the act 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 say that he did what he is 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.510
 when you are ready 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.220
 there was in the last month 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.070
 that way 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 Of course 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.879
 that this oracle was not trustworthy 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.689
 but after all 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.689
 that another alternative had 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.239
 this peculiar feeling was familiar to me 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.239
 and the camera appeared you must be altered by time 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.199
 at least in this sense the oracle had told the truth 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.519
 luis diego arrÃºa labor should be something like they promise 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.109
 Florentine Perez Becerril 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.829
 there is only one way to unite citizens 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.019
 rosemary 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 he is not an enemy 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.599
 the following is the summary
