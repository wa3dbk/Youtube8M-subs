00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
fitting me much looser 20 pounds does

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.900 
fitting me much looser 20 pounds does
make<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> big<00:05:14.580> difference<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:15.360> notice<00:05:15.810> um<00:05:16.170> I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
make a big difference in notice um I

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.100 
make a big difference in notice um I
noticing<00:05:17.910> even<00:05:18.420> if<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.600> look<00:05:18.750> at<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.960> other

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
noticing even if you look at the other

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.250 
noticing even if you look at the other
video<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.500> compared<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.520> video<00:05:21.260> I'll

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
video and compared to this video I'll

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.020 
video and compared to this video I'll
probably<00:05:22.410> put<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.680> comparison<00:05:23.340> on<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:23.760> side

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
probably put a comparison on this side

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.270 
probably put a comparison on this side
you<00:05:24.060> can<00:05:24.330> probably<00:05:24.510> see<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:25.050> could<00:05:25.860> see<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.190> in

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
you can probably see I could see it in

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.740 
you can probably see I could see it in
my<00:05:26.430> face<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:29.150> could<00:05:30.150> see<00:05:30.390> it<00:05:30.600> in<00:05:30.720> my<00:05:31.250> neckline

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
my face I could see it in my neckline

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.010 
my face I could see it in my neckline
see<00:05:34.670> it's<00:05:35.670> so<00:05:35.940> difference<00:05:36.420> I<00:05:36.570> mean<00:05:36.690> these<00:05:36.840> are

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
see it's so difference I mean these are

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.740 
see it's so difference I mean these are
the<00:05:37.110> things<00:05:37.320> may<00:05:37.710> not<00:05:37.740> mean<00:05:38.130> much<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.750> the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
the things may not mean much to the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.840 
the things may not mean much to the
average<00:05:39.900> person<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:40.620> when<00:05:40.770> you're<00:05:40.980> a<00:05:41.220> bigger

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
average person but when you're a bigger

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.060 
average person but when you're a bigger
person<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.510> start<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:42.840> notice<00:05:43.010> these<00:05:44.010> little

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
person you start to notice these little

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.250 
person you start to notice these little
things<00:05:44.340> are<00:05:44.730> getting<00:05:44.940> smaller<00:05:45.210> on<00:05:45.480> you<00:05:45.660> it's

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
things are getting smaller on you it's

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.650 
things are getting smaller on you it's
it's<00:05:46.830> accepting<00:05:47.670> i'm<00:05:47.910> leaving<00:05:48.360> with<00:05:48.450> some
