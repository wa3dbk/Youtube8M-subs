00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.020
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.320
 and I'm going to talk about light 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 the little gadgets that I made during the summer 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.099
 to support me in a coruña 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.409
 things like what is an exhibition 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.629
 ivonne 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.199
 or some cosat bots to do with academics 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 first I'm going to meat classes 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:24.819
 d 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:25.849
 these 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 devices that I have here present 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.990
 that already high can be used 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 together with the wii command l only 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.060
 we will start 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.360
 this gadget of you 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.530
 is an infrared pencil making and ammonium 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.780
 and some maybe path and tribute 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 getty the one that suffers red 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.330
 for when I grabbed 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.660
 the command of wii 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.060
 and hiding a screen 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.260
 and I'll tell him what he took from his uncle 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.520
 here on this surface 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.980
 counter that the source 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 for home zara 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.550
 and is that he believes that the doctor cahe 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.140
 this creates certain 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.630
 that the command of Luis 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.270
 can sin infrared light 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.380
 and the infrared light emitted by these infrared LEDs that by the way 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.490
 is that you already have installed 1 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 They can even watch with digital camera 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.040
 how to act this I did 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 very simple the scheme of this one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.200
 buying clothes 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.970
 the positive pole 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.000
 of the mets 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 is the one with the malaga paw 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.400
 and in negative the paw the shorter leg p 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.010
 they grab the positive pole 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.380
 I never spoke like that the push button 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 a push button is not the same with the push button switch 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.830
 at the time of tightening the circuit closes 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.439
 all drop it 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.439
 it opens it or that is no longer current 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.369
 good go from the positive to the push button 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.209
 and the button 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.149
 to the positive pole of the batteries 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.559
 denied from the negative pole directly to the pole 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.559
 negative of the stack 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.339
 10 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 they want to see again only can be seen with digital camera 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 so the human eye can not see 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:40.949
 flight 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.309
 this way 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.089
 It is a sensor bar 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.449
 the nintendo wii brings its own but I manufacture mine and pension equally 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.369
 so those who 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.689
 those who do not want to be in swat censorship 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.059
 Fabri that is the uce of it did not cost me much 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.619
 in blanket recycle trash 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.089
 the only thing since they were elected 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.089
 60 more expensive weight after jails 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.089
 chewed can not cost them 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.089
 what the price of the pile what the price of the tickets 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.880
 the insulating tape 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.309
 Over there 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.819
 I can see the cables 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.119
 of a vgb cable the most recommendable was clear from vcb because 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.679
 is the measure that needs channels 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.549
 Fortunately 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 this are not connected that in parallel 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.639
 each goes directly to the pole of the stack 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.359
 Negative Negative Negative Negative 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.189
 negative and negative natives in negative 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.049
 the positive that positive 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.859
 fota for lippi that everyone receives the same amount of current 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.730
 in theory that something else but more complicated 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.730
 parallel simplest scope 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.039
 although they are 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.109
 this type of circuit 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.009
 here you have to pamper that ten are faster 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.449
 but get the one that last long enough so there would not be much problem 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.799
 - Let's see an agreement 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.180
 this must be placed on the requests 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.220
 not necessarily down the screen costs close 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.449
 where is the player 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.159
 and point 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.289
 although you can also use a program on the pc 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.729
 for do 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.729
 as a pointer to make him eat 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.449
 back we will defend it 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.449
 the one that they expect to see them read on 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.189
 make sense 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.189
 I'm going to remove my the flash so that 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.139
 patel which appreciates well 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.199
 far 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.499
 the other side 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.659
 so slightly separated oct and in these by as far as 1 4 percent once 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.580
 hinterlaces better 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.159
 now pay 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.110
 this one here 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.479
 fair 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.969
 it is common 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.180
 I'm here 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.659
 the same the same function 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.659
 nothing more that they are more compact 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.930
 Strong flash lover currently is that maybe 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.569
 as you can see 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.569
 those here still 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.909
 that fair 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.909
 the outgoing hermitage that come in the Nazis 0 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.430
 it's more 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.580
 and how do you do it here for you to avoid is soldering cable 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.069
 the only thing I did was 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.330
 change the epp brought infrared poum 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.370
 do not need mine cables 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.419
 well done circuit 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.010
 and it's easier as you notice that they complicated his life by being modest 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.529
 and this one more compact 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.110
 that is more chiquititos more portable 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.710
 that's why you like it 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.710
 they are push buttons 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.319
 switches 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.599
 screws 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.649
 and the opponent clear fact fabricate mcmahon 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.889
 quirós make another of this one 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.889
 there were others 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.539
 and how to write down 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.729
 the infrared bar bring a 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.969
 a switch like this 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.050
 brings it in peace jack 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.349
 jealousy 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:01.979
 the model 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.979
 with insulating tape 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:09.520
 optical the lever 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.430
 these appreciations 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.460
 i the alpacas 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.710
 with the alpacas 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.199
 and this 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.860
 the compulsado 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.860
 as I mentioned 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:26.699
 when the PRI 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.699
 closes the circuit but when it reached them in the circuit 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.190
 in what this probable cardiff brings in that this is taken from a pistol 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.509
 videogame 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.580
 they stop their team's classic video games 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.629
 estoconazo bugaba kills pacts 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.629
 the other 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.419
 well this act was all 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:52.349
 next do not stop 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:56.129
 is the single show and all these devices in action 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.099
 on my computer here 

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:01.379
 large screen 

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.809
 I will demonstrate how each one works 

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:06.349
 of them in action 

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.969
 so that they understand better 

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:11.240
 this was all we do not see that next time
