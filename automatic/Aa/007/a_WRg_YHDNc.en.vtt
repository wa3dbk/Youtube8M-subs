00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
reminiscent of the AR 33 or whatever it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.810 
reminiscent of the AR 33 or whatever it
was<00:02:56.760> called<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:58.160> gold<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.370> think<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.760> was

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
was called in gold and I think it was

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.440 
was called in gold and I think it was
here<00:03:00.060> 33

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.229 

except<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.260> can't<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> wheel<00:03:04.040> them<00:03:04.250> you

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
except you can't do a wheel them you

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.610 
except you can't do a wheel them you
can't<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.629> a<00:03:05.660> wheelman<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:06.140> game<00:03:06.379> actually

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
can't do a wheelman this game actually

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.460 
can't do a wheelman this game actually
at<00:03:07.069> all<00:03:07.300> kind<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.750> don't<00:03:09.140> know<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.379> think

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
at all kind of I don't know I think

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.580 
at all kind of I don't know I think
that's<00:03:09.680> kind<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.129> letdown<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:10.970> think

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
that's kind of a letdown but I think

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.080 
that's kind of a letdown but I think
obviously<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:13.040> isn't<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> reason<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:14.060> I

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
obviously this isn't the reason but I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.330 
obviously this isn't the reason but I
mean<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:15.440> original<00:03:15.590> goldeneye

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
there my tear light I can't wait to the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.130 
there my tear light I can't wait to the
next<00:04:55.240> level<00:04:55.510> as<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:56.070> is<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.970> tort<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.720> Orca

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
next level as the is the tort not Orca

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.640 
next level as the is the tort not Orca
tauros<00:04:59.850> sniper<00:05:00.850> rifle<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.570> I'm<00:05:02.140> really<00:05:02.350> close

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
tauros sniper rifle and I'm really close

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.980 
tauros sniper rifle and I'm really close
to<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:03.310> then<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.180> level<00:05:04.420> 29<00:05:04.690> is<00:05:04.900> a

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
to that and then like level 29 is a

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.840 
to that and then like level 29 is a
bargain<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.680> got<00:05:06.100> like<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> bunch<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.610> guns

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
bargain so I got like a bunch of guns

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.820 
bargain so I got like a bunch of guns
coming<00:05:07.210> up<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.480> future<00:05:07.780> I'm<00:05:07.990> God<00:05:08.470> doing<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
coming up in the future I'm God doing a

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.730 
coming up in the future I'm God doing a
video<00:05:09.340> with<00:05:09.700> with<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.540> pistol<00:05:10.990> too<00:05:11.230> I'll

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
video with with a pistol too I'll

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.100 
video with with a pistol too I'll
probably<00:05:12.010> do<00:05:12.340> one<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.060> license<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.930> kill

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
probably do one of the license to kill

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.410 
probably do one of the license to kill
modes<00:05:14.440> with<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.460> because<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.030> pistol<00:05:16.390> is

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
modes with that because the pistol is

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.810 
modes with that because the pistol is
good<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:16.900> one<00:05:16.960> because<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.950> can<00:05:18.310> kill

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
good in that one because you can kill

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.610 
good in that one because you can kill
people<00:05:18.850> because<00:05:19.360> if<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.720> do<00:05:19.870> more<00:05:20.020> damage<00:05:20.320> and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
people because if you do more damage and

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.220 
people because if you do more damage and
license<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.160> kill<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.570> can<00:05:22.720> show<00:05:22.870> that<00:05:22.900> off

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
license to kill and I can show that off

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.780 
license to kill and I can show that off
now<00:05:23.500> because<00:05:23.740> I'm<00:05:24.070> high<00:05:24.220> enough<00:05:24.250> level<00:05:24.760> i

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
now because I'm high enough level i

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.700 
now because I'm high enough level i
can't<00:05:25.030> show<00:05:25.090> off<00:05:25.240> team<00:05:25.480> yet<00:05:25.810> i<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:26.380> show<00:05:26.530> off

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
can't show off team yet i can show off

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.700 
can't show off team yet i can show off
just<00:05:27.100> a<00:05:27.250> free-for-all<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.940> six<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.240> kill

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
just a free-for-all like six to kill

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.580 
just a free-for-all like six to kill
i'll<00:05:29.710> probably<00:05:30.010> show<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.460> off<00:05:30.670> in<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.590> future

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
i'll probably show that off in a future

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.260 
i'll probably show that off in a future
video<00:05:32.740> too

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
video too

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.520
