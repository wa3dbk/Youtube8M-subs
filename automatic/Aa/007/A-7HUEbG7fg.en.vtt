00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
first setup of trying to get it to a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.070 
first setup of trying to get it to a
working<00:02:16.730> screens<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.239> bright<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:17.989> a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
working screens really bright and it's a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.600 
working screens really bright and it's a
little<00:02:18.260> hard<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.500> me<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.770> get<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.010> steady

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
little hard for me to get a steady

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.059 
little hard for me to get a steady
recording<00:02:20.569> at<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.720> higher<00:02:20.870> resolution<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.799> for

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
recording at a higher resolution so for

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.940 
recording at a higher resolution so for
now<00:02:22.159> anyway<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.670> will<00:02:22.849> have<00:02:22.969> to<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:23.239> but<00:02:23.959> what

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
it in and this first video anyway is

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.120 
it in and this first video anyway is
just<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> first<00:03:33.709> 10<00:03:34.670> minutes<00:03:34.850> or<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.510> me

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
just the first 10 minutes or so of me

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.680 
just the first 10 minutes or so of me
walking<00:03:37.130> around<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.880> just<00:03:38.000> starting<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
walking around and just starting the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.170 
walking around and just starting the
game<00:03:38.840> nothing<00:03:39.530> exciting<00:03:39.920> nothing<00:03:40.310> new<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.730> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
game nothing exciting nothing new and I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.059 
game nothing exciting nothing new and I
find<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.540> very<00:03:41.569> similar<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> older<00:03:42.829> ones

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
find it very similar to the older ones

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.520 
find it very similar to the older ones
which<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.549> fine<00:03:43.819> because<00:03:44.420> i<00:03:44.870> remember<00:03:45.349> playing

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
which is fine because i remember playing

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.869 
team of six Pokemon and going against
the<00:05:32.629> Elite<00:05:32.779> Four<00:05:32.839> and<00:05:33.110> all<00:05:33.379> that<00:05:33.529> stuff<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:34.039> was

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
the Elite Four and all that stuff I was

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.519 
the Elite Four and all that stuff I was
wondering<00:05:35.240> if<00:05:35.479> there<00:05:35.689> was<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:35.990> point<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.409> that

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
wondering if there was a point to that

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.739 
wondering if there was a point to that
or<00:05:36.800> if<00:05:36.860> there's<00:05:37.039> a<00:05:37.099> faster<00:05:37.669> way<00:05:37.699> you<00:05:38.419> know<00:05:38.539> and

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
or if there's a faster way you know and

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.320 
or if there's a faster way you know and
from<00:05:39.259> what<00:05:39.409> I've<00:05:39.529> heard<00:05:39.559> the<00:05:40.460> best<00:05:40.729> way<00:05:40.999> is<00:05:41.300> to

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
from what I've heard the best way is to

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.299 
from what I've heard the best way is to
just<00:05:41.569> pick<00:05:42.169> a<00:05:42.199> starter<00:05:42.620> whatever<00:05:43.159> one<00:05:43.279> you

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:43.309 
just pick a starter whatever one you

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.670 
just pick a starter whatever one you
like<00:05:43.520> I'm<00:05:43.729> sure<00:05:43.909> it<00:05:43.969> doesn't<00:05:44.120> matter<00:05:44.680> from

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
like I'm sure it doesn't matter from

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.199 
like I'm sure it doesn't matter from
what<00:05:45.800> i<00:05:45.830> know<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.249> fires<00:05:46.490> usually<00:05:46.999> have<00:05:47.180> a

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:47.209 
what i know the fires usually have a

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:49.089 
what i know the fires usually have a
little<00:05:47.659> more<00:05:47.749> advantage<00:05:48.139> I<00:05:48.229> think<00:05:48.259> but<00:05:49.009> the

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
little more advantage I think but the

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.889 
little more advantage I think but the
long<00:05:49.249> run<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.520> don't<00:05:49.580> think<00:05:50.270> it's<00:05:50.419> too<00:05:50.629> much<00:05:50.659> of

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:50.899 
long run I don't think it's too much of

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:52.420 
long run I don't think it's too much of
a<00:05:51.080> big<00:05:51.259> deal<00:05:51.289> as<00:05:51.620> long<00:05:51.649> as<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.889> buy<00:05:52.009> potions

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
a big deal as long as you buy potions

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.639 
a big deal as long as you buy potions
and<00:05:52.550> items<00:05:52.789> if<00:05:52.909> it<00:05:52.999> gets<00:05:53.149> like<00:05:53.300> crazy<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:54.499> what

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:54.649 
and items if it gets like crazy and what

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:56.920 
and items if it gets like crazy and what
you<00:05:54.740> do<00:05:54.919> is<00:05:55.099> you<00:05:55.759> basically<00:05:55.909> just<00:05:56.240> play<00:05:56.810> with

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
you do is you basically just play with

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.189 
you do is you basically just play with
that<00:05:57.110> one<00:05:57.289> guy<00:05:57.469> possibly<00:05:58.129> a<00:05:58.219> second<00:05:58.639> one<00:05:58.759> and
