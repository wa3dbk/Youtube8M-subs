00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.710 
ops 3 for all using only the m1 a 911
and<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> tomica<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> finishing<00:01:33.360> kill

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and have a tomica is the finishing kill

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.100 
and have a tomica is the finishing kill
camp<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:35.090> decided<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> knife<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.630> few<00:01:36.840> people

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
camp so I decided the knife a few people

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620 
camp so I decided the knife a few people
because<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.759> series<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because well it's my series and if I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
because well it's my series and if I
want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> change<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> rules<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
want to change the rules I can but now I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.340 
want to change the rules I can but now I
still<00:01:42.210> consider<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.659> using<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> pistol

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
still consider that using the pistol

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.749 
still consider that using the pistol
only<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.979> mail<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.430> you're<00:01:44.579> close

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
only if you can mail a if you're close

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
only if you can mail a if you're close
enough<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.119> melee<00:01:45.450> stay<00:01:46.049> off<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> radar<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
enough to melee stay off the radar you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
enough to melee stay off the radar you
know<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.119> i<00:01:48.180> knifed<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.570> few

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
know it is what it is so i knifed a few

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
know it is what it is so i knifed a few
people<00:01:48.990> i<00:01:49.049> tell<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.470> 50<00:01:49.829> people<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
people i tell them off 50 people for the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.450 
people i tell them off 50 people for the
most<00:01:51.000> part<00:01:51.270> i<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.600> sneak<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.320> until<00:01:52.920> i<00:01:53.159> got

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
most part i got my sneak on until i got

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
most part i got my sneak on until i got
my<00:01:53.610> Blackbird<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.590> still

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
my Blackbird and then from there I still

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
my Blackbird and then from there I still
got<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.130> sneak<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.640> until<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.509> dogs<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
got my sneak on until I got my dogs and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
got my sneak on until I got my dogs and
then<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.670> opened<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.390> bit

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then I kind of opened up a little bit

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.569 
then I kind of opened up a little bit
tried<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.409> sure<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> game<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.070> finished

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
tried to make sure the game got finished

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
tried to make sure the game got finished
because<00:02:02.880> getting<00:02:03.509> kills<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> pistol

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
because getting kills with the pistol

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
because getting kills with the pistol
only<00:02:04.590> tends<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.250> slow

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
only tends to be a little slow

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
only tends to be a little slow
especially<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> big<00:02:06.479> map<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
especially on a big map like this and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.020 
especially on a big map like this and
especially<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.920> black<00:02:08.190> ops<00:02:08.429> free-for-all

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
especially in black ops free-for-all

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479 
especially in black ops free-for-all
where<00:02:09.239> people<00:02:09.539> tend<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.869> hide<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> corners<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
where people tend to hide in corners and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:11.830 
where people tend to hide in corners and
of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.059 
of
course<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.080> took<00:02:12.140> full<00:02:12.470> advantage<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:13.010> that

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
course I took full advantage of that

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
course I took full advantage of that
motion<00:02:13.550> sensor<00:02:13.879> for<00:02:14.030> those<00:02:14.180> ghost<00:02:14.480> bitches

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
motion sensor for those ghost bitches

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.979 
motion sensor for those ghost bitches
because<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.620> call<00:02:16.489> him<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.640> UAV<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.480> there'd

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
because I call him that UAV and there'd

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.780 
because I call him that UAV and there'd
be no<00:02:18.200> dot<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.709> although<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.310> behold<00:02:19.550> there

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
be no dot and although and behold there

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360 
be no dot and although and behold there
is<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:20.000> person<00:02:20.239> right<00:02:20.660> beside<00:02:20.959> me<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.769> motion

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
is a person right beside me so motion

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.030 
is a person right beside me so motion
sensor<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.879> perfect<00:02:23.300> for<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.769> my<00:02:24.769> class

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
sensor is perfect for that my class

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.220 
sensor is perfect for that my class

used that because mainly for the fast
reload<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> 80s<00:02:53.780> wasn't<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> huge<00:02:54.470> deal<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:55.069> a

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
reload the 80s wasn't a huge deal with a

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.759 
reload the 80s wasn't a huge deal with a
pistol<00:02:55.519> for<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.849> point<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:57.140> fast<00:02:57.440> reload

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
pistol for the point but the fast reload

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.110 
pistol for the point but the fast reload
was<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.040> huge<00:02:58.250> deal<00:02:58.430> because<00:02:58.579> like<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:58.879> said<00:02:58.940> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
was a huge deal because like I said you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.490 
was a huge deal because like I said you
burn<00:02:59.329> through<00:02:59.510> ammo<00:02:59.780> quickly<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.319> then<00:03:00.379> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
burn through ammo quickly and then the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.250 
burn through ammo quickly and then the
last<00:03:00.680> perk<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.579> believe<00:03:01.910> was<00:03:02.060> ninja<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.629> don't

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
last perk I believe was ninja I don't

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.240 
last perk I believe was ninja I don't

you dummy so anyways you guys see I got
the<00:03:23.510> Blackbird<00:03:23.930> up<00:03:24.109> I<00:03:24.430> didn't<00:03:25.430> run<00:03:25.549> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
the Blackbird up I didn't run the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.360 
the Blackbird up I didn't run the
chopper<00:03:26.030> gunner<00:03:26.209> because<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:27.250> figured<00:03:28.250> it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
chopper gunner because I figured it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.400 
chopper gunner because I figured it
would<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.489> overkill<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.299> needed<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> last<00:03:30.079> kill

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
would be overkill I needed the last kill

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.009 
would be overkill I needed the last kill
or<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.920> final<00:03:31.250> killcam<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.760> be<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.269> tomahawk

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
or the final killcam to be a tomahawk

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.629 
or the final killcam to be a tomahawk
and<00:03:33.319> with<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> chopper<00:03:33.920> gunner<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.220> dogs<00:03:34.430> up

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
and with the chopper gunner and dogs up

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.979 
and with the chopper gunner and dogs up
in<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.819> free<00:03:35.030> fall<00:03:35.180> at<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.389> same<00:03:35.420> time<00:03:35.720> it's

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
in a free fall at the same time it's

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.930 
in a free fall at the same time it's
probably<00:03:36.349> gonna<00:03:36.500> end<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.829> game<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.700> there<00:03:37.790> was

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
probably gonna end the game so there was

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.390 
probably gonna end the game so there was
definitely<00:03:38.359> no<00:03:38.450> point<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.220> as<00:03:40.220> you'll

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
definitely no point in that as you'll

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.589 
definitely no point in that as you'll
see<00:03:40.430> once<00:03:40.700> i<00:03:40.760> get<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.970> black<00:03:41.150> brought<00:03:41.359> up<00:03:41.480> i
