Q: Can you look back and comment on your fights?

00:00:13.759 --> 00:01:10.205
Urabe: On a fight against Yuki, I fought safe after I knocked down him. But I got too many of his low-kicks. And then I fought against Yamato with boxing technics because I'm better at boxing. Kubo knew I have injured my leg. It was hard for me to give the final match my best because of my injured leg. But then It's how one night tourney is. I admit Kubo was better tonight.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:18.495
Q: were you crying after the final match? 

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:34.419
Urabe: Well, because I couldn't give it my best. So I was annoyed myself.

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:41.292
Q: Yuki's low kicks injured your leg?

00:01:41.292 --> 00:02:21.762
Urabe: Yes. I did several things to lighten the injury but the damage was to severe to fight.

00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:33.528
Q: Are you interested in K-1 MAX -63kg world tourney which will be held in coming Autumn?

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:57.878
