00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 plus 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 I want to point out that this is a key step 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.990
 it's a brave historical step that's going to 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.030
 allow to advance in a very 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.340
 important in what is the process of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.170
 integration of all america even more 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.069
 semester we have in panama the summit 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.700
 from the americas there we're going to see the 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.259
 Heads of State for Latin America and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.869
 trade agreements relationships 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.000
 they will be strengthened with Cuba ' 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.479
 the relationship with Peru is also 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.569
 quite optimal with the island good in 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.179
 In general, the position of Peru has always 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.929
 been one of a strengthening of the 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.340
 bilateral relations with Cuba we have 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.590
 guys who have studied medicine in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.799
 Cuba with Cuban scholarships we have 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.329
 professionals today medical days the 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.430
 which we have also paid their 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.130
 studies and we have agreements in 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.049
 education in health and so on with Cuba ' 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 so with Cuba 'relationships 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.270
 bilateral are optimal I think never 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 They have been very shortly after decades 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.490
 relations with Cuba is in 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.580
 the level that we are today too 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.630
 I want to point out that within this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.750
 courageous and important decision for the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.670
 america integration process this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.520
 will also involve as he said the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.770
 President Castro and President Obama 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.130
 the exchange of people that in many 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.560
 cases for various reasons so detained 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.320
 in both countries this will involve in 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.170
 a trade opening process that 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.100
 will obviously benefit the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.150
 Cuban economy and also starts a 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.580
 new strategic political dialogue in 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.100
 all in all america with Cuba present 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.110
 but in addition to many rulers in 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.110
 different international forums in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.430
 United Nations 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 in events not only here but 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.710
 also in europe and the position of peru 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.410
 It has always been blunt, not that of 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.270
 allow this American blockade so 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.580
 it has been our position in nations 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.640
 united in meets the americas has 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.920
 been a position that in which the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.820
 Most Latin American voices have 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.460
 they have claimed and there is always an order 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.800
 permanent and I think that today it opens 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.110
 this possibility we believe had 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 I repeated it is a brave decision 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.690
 a historic decision that opens a new 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.900
 scenario in the integration process 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.360
 from america thank you very much president of 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.590
