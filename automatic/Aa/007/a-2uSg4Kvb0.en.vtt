user interface that would be the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
user interface that would be the
graphics<00:01:20.909> part<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> remember<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.110> this

photo Sudoku tutorial before this one we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
photo Sudoku tutorial before this one we
created<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.119> program<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> change

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
created a program but you had to change

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.030 
created a program but you had to change
the<00:01:29.430> code<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> wanted<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.770> Sudoku<00:01:31.770> grid

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the code if you wanted the Sudoku grid

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.690 
the code if you wanted the Sudoku grid
to<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.220> changed<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.170> nicer

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
to be changed and we would like a nicer

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
to be changed and we would like a nicer
drag-and-drop<00:01:37.520> graphical<00:01:38.520> grid<00:01:39.299> board

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
drag-and-drop graphical grid board

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.359 
drag-and-drop graphical grid board
representation<00:01:41.390> where<00:01:42.409> pawns<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.829> rooks<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
representation where pawns and rooks and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.840 
representation where pawns and rooks and
queens<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:45.049> visually<00:01:46.049> look<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.549> pawns<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
queens are visually look like pawns and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
queens are visually look like pawns and
rooks<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> queens<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> kings<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
rooks and queens and kings and so on and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
rooks and queens and kings and so on and
and<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.119> were<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.360> black<00:01:51.600> pieces<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and there were these black pieces and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.969 
and there were these black pieces and
white<00:01:52.649> pieces<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:54.600> whole<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:55.049> sort

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
white pieces and and that whole lot sort

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.660 
white pieces and and that whole lot sort
of<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.290> we'll<00:01:58.290> begin<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of thing and so we'll begin with that so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.800 
of thing and so we'll begin with that so
we'll<00:01:59.790> start<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.540> creating<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.250> a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
we'll start with just creating a a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
we'll start with just creating a a
graphic<00:02:03.810> creating<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.320> window<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
graphic creating this window that it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
graphic creating this window that it
displays<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> grid<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.600> we'll<00:02:06.719> move<00:02:06.930> on

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
displays a grid and then we'll move on

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
displays a grid and then we'll move on
from<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.060> create<00:02:09.060> icons<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.780> there

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
from that in and create icons in there

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.200 
from that in and create icons in there
and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:11.790> add<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
and then we will add a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.450 
and then we will add a
simple<00:02:13.420> mouse<00:02:13.600> feature<00:02:13.960> just<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.500> click<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
simple mouse feature just a click and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.490 
simple mouse feature just a click and
drag<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.690> program<00:02:16.990> knows<00:02:17.170> when<00:02:17.380> you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
drag so that the program knows when you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740 
drag so that the program knows when you
click<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> button<00:02:18.460> when<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.940> left<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> button

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
click a button when you left the button

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.540 
click a button when you left the button
and<00:02:20.730> mouse<00:02:21.730> button<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:24.340> won't

you could build upon what we will be

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
like that but yes we will go through

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.300 
like that but yes we will go through
some<00:03:05.470> basics<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.820> plan<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:08.070> begin<00:03:09.070> on

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
some basics and then I plan to begin on

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.790 
some basics and then I plan to begin on
a<00:03:09.700> discussion<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:11.160> how<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:13.300> chess<00:03:13.810> engine<00:03:14.290> how

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
a discussion of how a chess engine how

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.590 
a discussion of how a chess engine how
different<00:03:15.400> ways<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.790> could<00:03:15.970> program<00:03:16.420> a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
different ways that you could program a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.840 
different ways that you could program a
chess<00:03:16.900> engine<00:03:17.260> those<00:03:17.710> will<00:03:17.920> be<00:03:18.040> planted

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
chess engine those will be planted

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.870 
chess engine those will be planted
throughout<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.630> teach<00:03:20.070> different<00:03:21.070> parts<00:03:21.760> of

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
throughout as I teach different parts of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.050 
throughout as I teach different parts of
chess<00:03:22.240> program<00:03:22.750> we'll<00:03:22.930> start<00:03:23.260> by<00:03:24.070> creating<00:03:24.730> a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
chess program we'll start by creating a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.090 
chess program we'll start by creating a
representation<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.140> program<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.800> board

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
representation in the program of a board

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.370 
representation in the program of a board
and<00:03:27.370> then<00:03:27.460> we'll<00:03:27.610> move<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.330> finding<00:03:29.230> out

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
and then we'll move on to finding out

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.280 
and then we'll move on to finding out
what<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> which<00:03:30.610> moves<00:03:30.970> are<00:03:31.180> valid<00:03:31.720> or<00:03:31.900> which

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
what is a which moves are valid or which

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.740 
what is a which moves are valid or which
moves<00:03:32.530> aren't<00:03:32.800> valid<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.150> well<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.540> we'll

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
moves aren't valid and well and we'll

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.300 
moves aren't valid and well and we'll
just<00:03:34.990> slowly<00:03:35.290> build<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.800> go<00:03:36.070> really

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
just slowly build will go really

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.690 
just slowly build will go really
incrementally<00:03:37.210> slow<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.830> everyone

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
incrementally slow and so that everyone

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.400 
incrementally slow and so that everyone
can<00:03:39.880> follow<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:40.570> really<00:03:40.840> go<00:03:40.990> from<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> ground

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
can follow and really go from the ground

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.880 
can follow and really go from the ground
up<00:03:41.680> from<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:42.010> blank<00:03:42.340> slate<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.510> way<00:03:43.660> up<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
up from a blank slate all the way up to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600 
up from a blank slate all the way up to
a<00:03:44.920> program<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:47.440> play<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.860> reasonable

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
a program that can play a reasonable

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.730 
a program that can play a reasonable
game<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.940> chess<00:03:49.210> I<00:03:49.390> do<00:03:49.570> not<00:03:49.930> profess<00:03:50.380> with<00:03:50.410> this

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
game of chess I do not profess with this

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.140 
game of chess I do not profess with this
game<00:03:50.950> will<00:03:51.130> beat<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
game will beat you

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.870 
game will beat you
it<00:03:52.300> does<00:03:52.480> not<00:03:52.630> beat<00:03:52.840> me<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:54.130> engine<00:03:54.310> as<00:03:54.700> it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
it does not beat me the engine as it

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.420 
it does not beat me the engine as it
currently<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.510> might<00:03:55.660> be<00:03:55.810> revised

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
currently is it might be revised

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.220 
currently is it might be revised
hopefully<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.490> will<00:03:57.610> be<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.870> it<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:01.270> an<00:04:01.720> engine

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
hopefully it will be but it is an engine

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.980 
hopefully it will be but it is an engine
that<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.500> think<00:04:02.830> for<00:04:03.040> itself<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.550> has<00:04:03.730> a

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
that can think for itself that has a

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.570 
that can think for itself that has a
good<00:04:04.990> rationale<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.770> what<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.070> does<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.460> might

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
good rationale for what it does it might

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.910 
good rationale for what it does it might
not<00:04:06.760> think<00:04:07.000> super<00:04:07.780> far<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.380> advance

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
not think super far in advance

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.980 
not think super far in advance
currently<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.520> run<00:04:10.290> about<00:04:11.290> four<00:04:11.620> ply<00:04:11.890> deep<00:04:12.990> and

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
currently I run about four ply deep and

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.420 
currently I run about four ply deep and
I'll<00:04:14.170> explain<00:04:14.500> all<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.680> later<00:04:14.830> about<00:04:15.160> four

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
I'll explain all that later about four

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.970 
I'll explain all that later about four
ply<00:04:15.610> deep<00:04:15.910> takes<00:04:16.630> me<00:04:16.930> about<00:04:17.580> usually<00:04:18.930> three

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
ply deep takes me about usually three

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.140 
ply deep takes me about usually three
four<00:04:20.980> seconds<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:22.080> process<00:04:23.080> currently<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.370> I

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
four seconds to process currently and I

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.980 
four seconds to process currently and I
don't<00:04:25.419> consider<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.050> fast

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
don't consider that very fast

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.960 
don't consider that very fast
but<00:04:27.229> it's<00:04:27.410> definitely<00:04:27.650> better<00:04:28.100> than<00:04:28.430> previous

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
but it's definitely better than previous

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.689 
but it's definitely better than previous
versions<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:30.009> chess<00:04:31.009> engines<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.520> I've

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
versions of chess engines that I've

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.200 
versions of chess engines that I've
created<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.889> just<00:04:34.190> keeps<00:04:34.400> getting<00:04:34.580> faster

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
created and it just keeps getting faster

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.059 
created and it just keeps getting faster
it<00:04:35.330> keep<00:04:35.509> improving<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:36.860> there's

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
it keep improving on it but there's

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.420 
it keep improving on it but there's
always<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.789> improve<00:04:38.479> on<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.050> then

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
always that you improve on it and then

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.070 
always that you improve on it and then
that's<00:04:40.430> usually<00:04:40.759> you<00:04:41.599> improve<00:04:41.840> on<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
that's usually you improve on the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.730 
that's usually you improve on the
strength<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.220> engine<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:44.199> at<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.440> cost

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
strength of the engine and at the cost

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.939 
strength of the engine and at the cost
of<00:04:46.419> time<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.810> resources<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.530> then<00:04:48.860> you

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
of time and resources and then you

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.800 
of time and resources and then you
improve<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.669> speed<00:04:50.270> at<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:51.110> cost<00:04:51.410> of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
improve on the speed at the cost of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.779 
improve on the speed at the cost of
strength<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.229> so<00:04:54.740> there's<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.099> constant

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
strength and so there's that constant

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.999 
strength and so there's that constant
battle<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.509> I<00:04:56.539> could<00:04:56.870> easily<00:04:57.080> make<00:04:57.319> my<00:04:57.620> engine

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
battle so I could easily make my engine

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.659 
battle so I could easily make my engine
faster<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.570> would<00:04:59.690> be<00:04:59.810> at<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.050> expense<00:05:00.320> of

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
faster but it would be at the expense of

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.550 
faster but it would be at the expense of
of<00:05:03.430> just<00:05:04.720> accuracy<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:05.810> stuff<00:05:06.080> themselves

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
of just accuracy and stuff themselves

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.800 
of just accuracy and stuff themselves
there's<00:05:07.370> really<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.699> tight<00:05:08.240> line<00:05:08.449> that<00:05:08.690> you

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
there's really a tight line that you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.570 
there's really a tight line that you
have<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.080> try<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.349> jiggle<00:05:09.889> between<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.400> two

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
have to try to jiggle between the two

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.210 
have to try to jiggle between the two
and<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.660> far<00:05:11.900> I'm<00:05:12.020> at<00:05:12.169> four<00:05:12.440> ply<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.680> would<00:05:13.009> like

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
and so far I'm at four ply I would like

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.110 
and so far I'm at four ply I would like
to<00:05:13.400> go<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.580> six<00:05:14.120> or<00:05:14.330> seven<00:05:14.360> pi<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:14.960> think<00:05:15.289> those

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
to go to six or seven pi I think those

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.610 
to go to six or seven pi I think those
greatly<00:05:17.120> increase<00:05:17.449> my<00:05:17.599> strengths<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.380> have

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
greatly increase my strengths but I have

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.710 
greatly increase my strengths but I have
to<00:05:18.830> uh<00:05:18.860> obviously<00:05:19.699> knock<00:05:19.909> back<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.419> some<00:05:20.570> other

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
to uh obviously knock back on some other

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.420 
to uh obviously knock back on some other
things<00:05:21.020> or<00:05:21.199> come<00:05:21.409> up<00:05:21.500> with<00:05:21.620> something<00:05:21.949> smarter

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
things or come up with something smarter

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.760 
things or come up with something smarter
anyways<00:05:23.180> so<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:23.840> won't<00:05:24.080> be<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.199> perfect

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
anyways so this won't be a perfect

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.379 
anyways so this won't be a perfect
engine<00:05:25.130> that<00:05:25.280> we<00:05:25.430> are<00:05:25.520> trading<00:05:25.909> but<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.180> will

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
engine that we are trading but it will

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.089 
engine that we are trading but it will
be<00:05:26.569> a<00:05:26.599> chess<00:05:26.930> engine<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.590> goes<00:05:27.770> through<00:05:28.009> the

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
be a chess engine that goes through the

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.800 
be a chess engine that goes through the
basic<00:05:28.220> things<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:30.820> another<00:05:31.820> thing<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.300> like<00:05:32.659> I

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
basic things and another thing is like I

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.810 
basic things and another thing is like I
said<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.259> briefly<00:05:33.650> mentioned<00:05:34.070> before<00:05:34.400> we'll<00:05:34.789> be

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
said I briefly mentioned before we'll be

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.100 
said I briefly mentioned before we'll be
putting<00:05:35.180> in<00:05:35.419> segments<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.610> videos<00:05:37.610> in<00:05:37.849> between

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
putting in segments of videos in between

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.839 
putting in segments of videos in between
where<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.380> will<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.770> be<00:05:39.919> discussing<00:05:40.370> here's

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
where I will just be discussing here's

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.029 
where I will just be discussing here's
different<00:05:41.060> methods<00:05:41.690> that<00:05:41.810> people<00:05:41.930> use<00:05:42.289> here's

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
different methods that people use here's

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.189 
different methods that people use here's
why<00:05:43.340> I'm<00:05:43.610> using<00:05:43.820> this<00:05:44.150> method<00:05:44.599> we<00:05:44.630> I<00:05:44.930> won't

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
why I'm using this method we I won't

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.899 
why I'm using this method we I won't
just<00:05:45.409> say<00:05:45.560> okay<00:05:45.770> this<00:05:45.949> is<00:05:46.130> how<00:05:46.219> you<00:05:46.280> program<00:05:46.550> in

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
just say okay this is how you program in

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.350 
just say okay this is how you program in
this<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.449> function<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.080> does<00:05:48.289> I'll<00:05:48.500> have<00:05:48.560> a

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
this is the function it does I'll have a

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.790 
this is the function it does I'll have a
bit<00:05:50.360> of<00:05:50.389> an<00:05:50.599> overview<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.380> perhaps<00:05:51.500> some

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
bit of an overview and perhaps some

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.310 
bit of an overview and perhaps some
lengths<00:05:52.190> for<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.430> further<00:05:53.389> research<00:05:53.960> if<00:05:54.169> you're

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
lengths for a further research if you're

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.439 
lengths for a further research if you're
interested<00:05:55.039> on<00:05:55.690> exactly<00:05:57.310> why<00:05:58.310> am<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.699> doing

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
interested on exactly why am I doing

00:05:59.449 --> 00:05:59.620 
interested on exactly why am I doing
this

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
this

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.159 
this
like<00:05:59.870> for<00:06:00.080> instance<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.560> use<00:06:00.800> a<00:06:01.060> raised<00:06:02.169> two

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
like for instance I use a raised two

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.070 
like for instance I use a raised two
dimensional<00:06:03.650> raise<00:06:03.889> to<00:06:04.190> represent<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.699> board

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
dimensional raise to represent a board

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.100 
dimensional raise to represent a board
chess<00:06:06.080> board<00:06:06.590> instead<00:06:07.490> of<00:06:07.840> what<00:06:08.840> most

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
chess board instead of what most

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.050 
chess board instead of what most
professional<00:06:09.889> chess<00:06:10.070> engines<00:06:10.460> use<00:06:10.669> which<00:06:10.909> is

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
professional chess engines use which is

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.620 
professional chess engines use which is
a<00:06:11.090> bit<00:06:11.389> bored<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:12.169> I'll<00:06:13.009> explain<00:06:13.490> why<00:06:13.789> and<00:06:14.240> in

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
a bit bored and I'll explain why and in

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.550 
a bit bored and I'll explain why and in
that<00:06:14.780> case<00:06:14.990> it<00:06:15.229> basically<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:15.949> it's<00:06:17.259> easier<00:06:18.259> to

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
that case it basically is it's easier to

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.100 
that case it basically is it's easier to
understand<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.699> so<00:06:20.389> I<00:06:20.419> think<00:06:20.570> that's<00:06:20.870> better

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
understand and so I think that's better

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.909 
understand and so I think that's better
for<00:06:21.229> this<00:06:21.560> tutorial<00:06:22.719> and<00:06:23.719> so<00:06:24.050> on<00:06:24.229> and<00:06:24.409> so<00:06:24.770> we'll

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
for this tutorial and so on and so we'll

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.890 
for this tutorial and so on and so we'll
go<00:06:25.099> through<00:06:25.370> a<00:06:25.400> bunch<00:06:25.849> of<00:06:25.969> discussions<00:06:26.479> on

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
go through a bunch of discussions on

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.890 
go through a bunch of discussions on
just<00:06:27.740> why<00:06:28.219> am<00:06:28.490> i<00:06:28.610> doing<00:06:28.669> it<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.360> just<00:06:29.659> to<00:06:29.780> give

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
just why am i doing it and just to give

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.270 
just why am i doing it and just to give
you<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.020> bit<00:06:30.199> background<00:06:30.469> so<00:06:30.860> when<00:06:31.070> we're

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
you a bit background so when we're

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.219 
you a bit background so when we're
finished<00:06:31.610> this<00:06:31.880> tutorial<00:06:32.449> you<00:06:32.810> can<00:06:33.020> turn

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
finished this tutorial you can turn

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.829 
finished this tutorial you can turn
around<00:06:33.289> and<00:06:33.860> create<00:06:34.580> your<00:06:34.729> own<00:06:34.789> unique<00:06:35.539> one

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:35.839 
around and create your own unique one

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.450 
around and create your own unique one
and<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.110> don't<00:06:36.289> have<00:06:36.500> to<00:06:36.800> up<00:06:37.690> just<00:06:38.690> have<00:06:38.870> a

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
and you don't have to up just have a

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.510 
and you don't have to up just have a
a program<00:06:41.449> that<00:06:41.630> I've<00:06:41.840> written<00:06:42.310> like<00:06:43.310> that

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
a program that I've written like that

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.059 
a program that I've written like that
you<00:06:43.669> can<00:06:43.880> think<00:06:44.210> okay<00:06:44.449> this<00:06:44.960> is<00:06:45.169> how<00:06:45.319> he<00:06:45.380> did<00:06:45.680> it

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
you can think okay this is how he did it

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.760 
you can think okay this is how he did it
this<00:06:46.490> is<00:06:46.669> why<00:06:47.000> he<00:06:47.300> did<00:06:47.509> it<00:06:47.539> and<00:06:47.870> I<00:06:48.350> think<00:06:48.620> see<00:06:48.740> I

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
this is why he did it and I think see I

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.650 
this is why he did it and I think see I
had<00:06:49.009> a<00:06:49.039> slight<00:06:49.490> flaw<00:06:49.819> here<00:06:50.180> there<00:06:50.419> could<00:06:50.599> have

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
had a slight flaw here there could have

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.809 
had a slight flaw here there could have
been<00:06:50.780> something<00:06:51.050> better<00:06:51.500> so<00:06:52.099> let<00:06:52.280> me<00:06:52.370> change

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
been something better so let me change

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.050 
been something better so let me change
that<00:06:53.000> and<00:06:53.539> so<00:06:54.139> I<00:06:54.380> do<00:06:54.830> hope<00:06:55.490> that<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:55.789> will

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
that and so I do hope that you will

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.600 
that and so I do hope that you will
improve<00:06:56.300> and<00:06:56.960> build<00:06:57.229> and<00:06:57.590> expand<00:06:58.069> on<00:06:58.250> this<00:06:58.340> and

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
improve and build and expand on this and

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.930 
improve and build and expand on this and
I<00:06:59.289> really<00:07:00.289> look<00:07:00.440> forward<00:07:00.710> to<00:07:00.830> this<00:07:01.069> ongoing

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.730 

project<00:07:04.940> and<00:07:05.240> so<00:07:05.900> this<00:07:06.169> is<00:07:06.319> something<00:07:06.620> I'm

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
project and so this is something I'm

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.029 
project and so this is something I'm
really<00:07:07.220> excited<00:07:07.610> about<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.900> I<00:07:09.380> look<00:07:09.620> forward

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
really excited about and I look forward

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.689 
really excited about and I look forward
to<00:07:10.699> see<00:07:11.120> where<00:07:11.240> this<00:07:11.389> takes<00:07:11.599> us<00:07:12.550> until<00:07:13.550> next

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
to see where this takes us until next

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.930 
to see where this takes us until next
time<00:07:14.030> enjoy<00:07:14.240> Java
