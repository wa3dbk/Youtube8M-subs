00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.690
 let's prepare the tomatoes for this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.690
 salad 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.140
 and this is super easy we remove the part 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.750
 down 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.810
 that nobody is going to eat it and nobody 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.810
 he wants this to come out for him to eat 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.140
 and we are simply going to do it in a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 cross 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 my new one we try to make squares 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 of the size that you like because it is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.120
 your salad the presentation you handle 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.360
 you now I'm going to cut the paprika 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.449
 to me the paprika I like cooked raw 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.699
 in any presentation it is important 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.190
 that you take out the seeds and this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.190
 part of here that is like the stem I do not know 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.160
 and I retired him one more part here I have 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.890
 already the paprika ready to cut it in 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.860
 Julian in squares as you prefer 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.660
 eat it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.120
 to my pair in room I like in Julian 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.370
 and they are very dry and these are what I did but 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.580
 it's good for my salad it's something very 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.340
 Quick 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.840
 we are not going to express ourselves because the paper 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.740
 it did not fit us I love them more 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.630
 little 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.630
 so that's how 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.270
 and if you want to see and understand a little more 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.690
 about why I retire a little more 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 that waves seed and that vein that 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.090
 normally brings the paprika I'm going to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.720
 leave a link in the information box 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.360
 to a video that I already have so that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 you can learn how to cut a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.409
 paprika here I have several leaves of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.530
 lettuce from the round lettuce 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.229
 not from the long and if you want to use the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.939
 long there is no problem of anybody 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.840
 I have the round one so I'm going to 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.509
 I cut a roll with the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.070
 with the leaves and I cut it as well as me 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.259
 I like the next thing I'm going to use 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.090
 it's celery then you're 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.750
 I'll save the little leaves because 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.000
 I can make an infusion 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.940
 what in Colombia we would call a water 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.880
 aromatic I always remove the part of the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.800
 I do not like tail often comes a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.780
 little dirty and even though I wash the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.810
 vegetable does not take away and comes a little 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.970
 burned this edge then I remove it what 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.490
 retirement 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.650
 Well I have this and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.180
 use this bit the other I'm going to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.610
 book in the refrigerator and the shorts 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.790
 so very 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.420
 very small that are easy to bite 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.680
 and I'm ready, I have my 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.170
 my plane ready for the salad all 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.940
 they know and they know the purple onion in 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.270
 many countries call them red onion 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.910
 but it's really violet purple like that 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.630
 I'm going to cut it in 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.180
 but more 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.580
 and I also have a video about cuts of 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.170
 onion that you can go see in the 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.680
 information box I'll leave you everything 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.680
 that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.290
 but this onion I'm not going to put it like that 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.060
 because you already know that the onion 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.160
 has a special spiciness that does not with the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.510
 that we do not want to meet in any 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 type of salad is a little spicy 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.770
 annoying if I see many we do not like 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.990
 so what I'm going to do is remove 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.780
 that spicy and 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.140
 of that also I already made a video we are going to 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.060
 start putting together this delicious salad 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.690
 and they end in the lettuce 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.690
 goodbye 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.709
 here I have the tomato 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.890
 and now I'm going to put the onion and the 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:14.629
 paprika that I passed through a pan 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.629
 quoted before because for my taste 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.060
 the salads are very cold 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.580
 even though the vegetables are at 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.490
 topic 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.800
 I do not know I need something hot that 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.250
 accompany the salad 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:37.909
 or how to mix and make it warm or 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.909
 warm something I do not like it to be so cold 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.090
 well we mix it 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 What we can do is put a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.070
 little pepper 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.480
 Salt pepper and a dash of oil 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.720
 olive 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.450
 this is the salad that I would recommend 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.840
 for people who suffer from cholesterol 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:06.340
 high and hypertension 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.470
 It is an excellent option for the dead 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.630
 I hope you like it and that if you know 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.340
 someone who suffers hypertension please 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.229
 pass it on 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.169
 It is important that we start caring 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.750
 it is important that if we have 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.169
 diseases we know how to cope with 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.169
 diet 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.600
 results are seen if you are consistent with 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.540
 the treatments so this would be 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.950
 a good ingredient to accompany a 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.200
 lunch 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.470
 I send a hug to all those who God 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.870
 I bless you I hope you have a nice 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.180
 week or month I do not know when they go to see 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.010
 this but, but may God be 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.410
 always illuminating his life 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.180
 a hug I want to recommend you very
