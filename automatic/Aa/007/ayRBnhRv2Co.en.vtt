figure<00:01:34.740> let's<00:01:34.890> start<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> paint<00:01:35.430> ABS

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
figure let's start with the paint ABS

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.080 
figure let's start with the paint ABS
very<00:01:36.150> nice<00:01:37.549> very<00:01:39.049> similar<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.700> thought<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
very nice very similar and I thought the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.940 
very nice very similar and I thought the
shield<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:46.460> apparently<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
shield was new it's apparently it is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
shield was new it's apparently it is
it's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.420> flatter<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:53.090> think<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it's a little bit flatter I think as you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's a little bit flatter I think as you
can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.409> little

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
can see you can see and it's a little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.289 
can see you can see and it's a little
bit<00:01:59.340> smaller<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> shield<00:02:02.299> paint

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
bit smaller I think with a shield paint

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.499 
bit smaller I think with a shield paint
apps<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.229> dull<00:02:04.670> some<00:02:05.670> issues<00:02:06.149> as

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
apps a little bit dull some issues as

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.320 
apps a little bit dull some issues as
you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.140> I've<00:02:07.979> seen<00:02:08.280> figures<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you can see I've seen figures that have

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.809 
you can see I've seen figures that have
the<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> skewed<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.640> to

it<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.260> necessary<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.980> mean<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.280> could<00:03:31.459> have

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
it was necessary I mean this could have

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.720 
it was necessary I mean this could have
been<00:03:31.609> another<00:03:31.880> figure<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> wave<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.690> had

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
been another figure in the wave you had

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.199 
been another figure in the wave you had
Wolverine<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:37.250> had<00:03:37.400> Wolverine<00:03:37.940> and

Wolverine and you had Wolverine and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.569 
Wolverine and you had Wolverine and
Archangel<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:39.200> wave<00:03:39.410> might<00:03:40.220> as<00:03:40.400> well

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
Archangel in this wave might as well

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.940 
Archangel in this wave might as well
should<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.060> added<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.109> don't<00:03:42.319> know<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
Psylocke figure out to this wave so you

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.080 
Psylocke figure out to this wave so you
can<00:03:46.010> complete<00:03:46.310> x-force<00:03:46.790> or<00:03:48.190> yeah<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.819> they've

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
can complete x-force or yeah but they've

you know sigh look apparently is in

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.509 
you know sigh look apparently is in
another<00:03:52.280> wave<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.769> usually<00:03:54.769> there's<00:03:55.340> only

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
another wave and usually there's only

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.440 
another wave and usually there's only
one<00:03:55.790> female<00:03:56.120> figure<00:03:56.450> for<00:03:56.840> each<00:03:57.200> wave<00:03:58.450> could

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
one female figure for each wave could

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.479 
one female figure for each wave could
have<00:03:59.540> been<00:03:59.630> another<00:03:59.840> figure<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:01.190> could<00:04:01.400> have

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
have been another figure it could have

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.780 
have been another figure it could have
been<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:01.609> gambit<00:04:02.120> figure<00:04:02.600> could<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:03.049> been<00:04:03.790> oh

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
been a gambit figure could have been oh

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.479 
been a gambit figure could have been oh
I<00:04:05.630> don't<00:04:05.870> know<00:04:06.489> another<00:04:07.489> Avenger<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.980> Captain

I don't know another Avenger not Captain
America<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.150> think<00:04:11.209> it's<00:04:11.600> way<00:04:11.840> too<00:04:11.870> much<00:04:12.290> but

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
America I think it's way too much but

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.360 
America I think it's way too much but
you<00:04:13.250> know<00:04:13.959> this<00:04:14.959> particular<00:04:15.170> figure<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:16.010> from

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
you know this particular figure is from

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.940 
you know this particular figure is from
The<00:04:16.519> Ultimates<00:04:17.090> universe<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.829> an

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
The Ultimates universe and it's an

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.759 
The Ultimates universe and it's an
alternate<00:04:19.510> universe<00:04:20.510> from<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.019> six<00:04:21.320> one<00:04:21.470> six

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
alternate universe from the six one six

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.370 
alternate universe from the six one six
and<00:04:22.190> if<00:04:22.550> you're<00:04:22.700> really<00:04:23.030> into<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.380> the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
and if you're really into that the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.820 
and if you're really into that the
stories<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.099> comic<00:04:25.400> books

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
stories and the comic books

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.740 
stories and the comic books
the<00:04:25.949> toys<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.699> figures<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.300> particular

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
the toys and figures in that particular

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.969 
the toys and figures in that particular
universe<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.319> suppose<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.740> would<00:04:28.889> be

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
universe and I suppose this would be

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.950 
universe and I suppose this would be
appeal<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:29.759> for<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.509> casual

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
appeal to you but for the casual

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.749 
appeal to you but for the casual
collector<00:04:31.409> I<00:04:31.439> think<00:04:31.919> we<00:04:32.009> don't<00:04:32.159> really<00:04:32.490> need

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
collector I think we don't really need

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.089 
collector I think we don't really need
another<00:04:33.409> you<00:04:34.409> guys<00:04:34.590> don't<00:04:34.770> really<00:04:34.889> need

another you guys don't really need

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.589 
another you guys don't really need
