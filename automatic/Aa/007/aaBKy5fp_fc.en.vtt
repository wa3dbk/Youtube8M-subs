were coming through that were charged

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.130 
were coming through that were charged
and<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.370> was<00:01:12.460> surfing<00:01:12.820> really<00:01:12.910> well<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.930> seemed

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
and it was surfing really well it seemed

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.230 
and it was surfing really well it seemed
to<00:01:14.230> me<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.470> really<00:01:14.710> evolved<00:01:15.250> from<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.580> era

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
to me it really evolved from the era

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.810 
to me it really evolved from the era
before<00:01:16.510> mine<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.320> where<00:01:17.590> our<00:01:17.620> era<00:01:17.980> was<00:01:18.280> there

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
before mine to where our era was there

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.910 
before mine to where our era was there
was<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:18.940> real<00:01:19.120> transition<00:01:19.540> from<00:01:19.900> just<00:01:20.380> strictly

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
was a real transition from just strictly

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.130 
was a real transition from just strictly
power<00:01:21.550> based<00:01:21.820> surfing<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.480> then<00:01:22.660> going<00:01:22.960> into

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
power based surfing to then going into

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.800 
power based surfing to then going into
maneuver<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:24.070> was<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.250> evolution<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
maneuver so that was the evolution and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.200 
maneuver so that was the evolution and
it<00:01:26.170> raised<00:01:26.410> our<00:01:26.620> level<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.100> know<00:01:27.250> was<00:01:27.490> it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
it raised our level you know was it's

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.240 
it raised our level you know was it's
kind<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.510> like<00:01:28.690> what<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.650> Kelly<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.070> Mick

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
kind of like what what Kelly and Mick

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.740 
kind of like what what Kelly and Mick

the<00:01:33.970> Jillian<00:01:34.330> Wilson's<00:01:34.720> coming<00:01:34.990> through<00:01:35.170> it's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
the Jillian Wilson's coming through it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.130 
the Jillian Wilson's coming through it's
it's<00:01:35.950> what<00:01:36.160> we<00:01:36.280> had<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.550> do<00:01:36.670> back<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.360> it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
it's what we had to do back then so it

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.050 
it's what we had to do back then so it
was<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.560> me<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.160> young<00:01:39.550> guns<00:01:39.759> era<00:01:39.970> I

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
was to me that the young guns era I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.450 
was to me that the young guns era I
think<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:41.080> know<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.619> were<00:01:41.770> kind<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
think that you know we were kind of the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.940 
think that you know we were kind of the
new<00:01:42.640> breed<00:01:42.910> but<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.960> 90s<00:01:44.320> was<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.590> young<00:01:44.740> guns

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
new breed but the 90s was the young guns

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.600 
new breed but the 90s was the young guns
for<00:01:45.190> sure

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
for sure

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.730 
for sure
surfing<00:01:46.300> had<00:01:46.420> come<00:01:46.630> about<00:01:46.750> early<00:01:47.410> fire<00:01:47.590> to

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
surfing had come about early fire to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.280 
surfing had come about early fire to
come<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.070> forefront
