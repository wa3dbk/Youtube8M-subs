00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.929
 he's very good guys and girls and 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.310
 lovers of video games stories in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.629
 game and good this time as you are watching 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 I'm going to teach the title to take out the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.280
 achievement of not a scratch achieved everything 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.019
 it depends on what they are playing either 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 xbox and playstation but good this achievement 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 it's a bit simple, it's not so 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.490
 complicated as they see it the problem is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.290
 how good as everyone feels 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 ready to kill 10 people without 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.740
 hurt yourself but it's not that simple 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.310
 just when you're fighting already 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 together of these 10 these 10 soldiers and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 you are already giving them wherever we are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.109
 they are killing good as they are so 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.089
 smart and after you kill 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.219
 several suppose that more of those five 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.469
 they are going to flee, the others are going to open 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.210
 54 others left will start to hear 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.739
 and well you will have to reach them but 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.079
 the same and they will not tell you the achievement 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 that are almost almost followed and you can not 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 be giving as we suppose too 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.859
 time is commercial is a kind of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.140
 sale here and the multi death on yale or 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.850
 Call of Duty or wherever to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 I say players is an idea if they have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 to be almost almost followed but when 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.309
 what I am going to recommend you already know 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 as always is that good here as is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 well in the video starts 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.030
 will cause some guards ok I already have 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.000
 thirsty come let's take it for sack let's go 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
 let's look for some guards can 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.670
 do it exactly where I did it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.500
 I do not place myself more in this place but 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.290
 it's good in Florence and some are 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.120
 accounting more or less where I am 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.150
 Ok well, you turn it on 23 guards 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.380
 prepare eye eye smoke bombs that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 prepare the smoke bomb before 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 start the fight here I bring you towards 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.570
 a point of guards that I do not know how many 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 they are I do not know how many seem to me there I think 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 that are like four and from nothing come 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.550
 other two but good is if you the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.190
 you want to do there and see if it comes out 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.229
 how good are the 456 789 there 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.729
 they are nine guards nothing would miss one 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.590
 then I do not know where they arrive I think they arrive 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.479
 from the street next door but good there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.880
 I see that they begin to approach prepared the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.040
 smoke pump for the fans this be 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.800
 your order and with double hidden sheets 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.070
 eye with the doubles starts doing to 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 kill them all in what they are 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.010
 clueless by these smoke bombs 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
 there comes one more that wants me to 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.929
 it was necessary to get back the pump of 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.239
 smoke and come or that is the key to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.560
 any achievement if you can not environmental 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.680
 smoke bombs come 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 they are all clueless the killers and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.690
 without any problem is achievement 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.160
 unlocked 20 points or a scratch like that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.290
 how good I think here the most difficult 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.569
 for me it was to catch the messenger of the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.069
 borgia that was already as they take me out of 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.810

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
