00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.520
 ready with the IWB software 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.359
 you keep the traffic in class 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.559
 it is the way to make traffic attractive to the trade 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.439
 to enliven students 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.479
 The lesson that you want to treat is shown on the IWB 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.400
 If you click on an image, it will become the largest 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.710
 with it she immediately gets all the attention from the class and you can control the traffic situation 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.460
 to speak well 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.739
 all extras have been added to each lesson 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.050
 under this icon you will find extra interactive exercises that are not in it 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.600
 workbook 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 who students immediately see if they are right 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.890
 Hey 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.090
 the attention individual 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.330
 over eighty film clips have been added 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.780
 With this you achieve every traffic theme lifelike in the classroom 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 always a child from the target age group plays the leading role 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.809
 I really give up 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.809
 the council of europe 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.500
 All of these suggest going for all the holes in the same way 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.440
 to get a better picture of road safety 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 movies have been added 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 this is where the most important traffic is thoroughly covered 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.430
 the intersection did not score priority 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 you simply want to shorten the intersection without priority 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.420
 in Belgium save the crossroads 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 also the bikes 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 Wild also has for the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.200
 the morning 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.250
 An enlivening lesson is the traffic studio 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.929
 for a large number of lessons, traffic situation has already been recreated for you 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.970
 On the yellow note papers you will find the question that you can ask the class 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
 the answer you will find under this iconic 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:15.190
 With a traffic study joop you can also recreate situations yourself 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.459
 for example, that difficult intersection near their school 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.719
 the selects the desired intersection 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.099
 the desired road users and now placed road signs and 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.739
 the situation I then used during class 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.599
 this attracts the students so it is a traffic situation on it 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.649
 build a digital whiteboard 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 you can find a traffic study smoke in the chest of drawers 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.409
 and here you will find even more extras to make it too easy 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.809
 traffic signs library added 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:48.179
 This contains the traffic signs according to the classification of safe traffic in the Netherlands 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.179
 supplemented with the traffic signs 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.510
 because you can easily complete the traffic lessons yourself 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.449
 could add m save to ns 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.489
 think of photos on a video of the traffic situation in the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.979
 school environment 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.179
 this way it brings the wrong even closer to the children 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.919
 you can take pictures easier the peloton 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.899
 You can make the best videos by creating and answering traffic questions 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 youtube and then digitally link in doctor 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.509
 at the lesson in question a doctor appears who fries in bonn so you see 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.439
 simply that he has added a bomb 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.169
 according to a lot is used to life 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.129
 of the danger 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.719
 4 shame on 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.579
 10 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 used to be 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.579
 if you are unable to take photos on a film outside 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.460
 You can also use the spray CIOs of Boekel knife and this as the union 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.839
 add to ns 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.809
 adding your own sources 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:59.229
 you can discuss complex situations in the neighborhood in class 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.489
 of course you can also view photos and videos of the traffic around the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.489
 have the school make it themselves 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.740
 this your agenda number of options 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.220
 how you as a teacher can make how traffic lessons live to go 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.729
 after the classroom part, the students can work independently with 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.699
 train the workbook and the traffic 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.479
 the Indian tool to get the children involved in traffic 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.979
 to practise 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.730
 dick freebird software from noordhoff publishers 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.599
