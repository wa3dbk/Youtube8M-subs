00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.090
 another video 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.670
 today it is with the dirty work for 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 thank the reader for saying that my videos 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.420
 looks I did not know where he the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 Might have mentioned really cool maybe if 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.340
 you that would be glad if you 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.320
 Something knows about the comments does not matter 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.900
 which is definitely going on today 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 we need now for the middle ran 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 a bottom plate we could of course 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 I want to fix it right here 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 but not because here then would have one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.350
 incise opening and everyone 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.770
 Incision in the plate is one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.879
 weakening of the plate so would 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 I do that on the plate and then 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.670
 cut them and their ratings because 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 which is gear sets forth something 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.730
 You have to get bigger than aging here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 Now we'll make the gear smaller 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.390
 that would have been fixed here too 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.470
 but we need one gold tooth 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 Opening or I need such distances 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 pack here as small pieces on it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 even the washers could be 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.799
 but that we are all too unstable 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.299
 there should be reasonable and then 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.530
 really everything here is a stiffening 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 make for the car 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.600
 that will go from here to here me 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
 make here so two alu mounts is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.700
 would fix here and then I will 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 probably take carbon distanced 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.820
 one does not want to go through this though 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.259
 firm but carboxylic it is flexible and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.490
 should not crash at most what is me 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.490
 hope to fall apart 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.909
 or I do not take all that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.350
 of course that's so rich now 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.750
 then that is for example 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.880
 Carbon has a stiffening here 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 then I can wonderful all cables 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.590
 embarrassed and in which the simple reason 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.500
 then I can do it too 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.440
 and switch off actually install 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.470
 very practical then you have to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.170
 probably not cut short and we 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.519
 would not fly around like that somehow 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 then I could also get the cable from 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.310
 definitely want to make the cars 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 do so 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.799
 yes and I will believe that first 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.450
 first time I exactly 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.860
 badge and when I showed that off 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.530
 maybe that excludes and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.530
 then we will meet again in any case 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 and make that was here I am 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.290
 already the middle ship is locked 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.799
 actually quite simply somehow the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:11.480
 screw does not have to lead in purely that is 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.480
 bombproof and can not prove that 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.340
 because we would not drive a front wheel drive 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.470
 the whole power that goes away if that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.049
 medium which is not locked and the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 Rear wheels and no power 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.230
 yes okay I'll tell you right up to me 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 now wanted to show you a short time 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.750
 how I do it now I have that 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.530
 now properly clamped that 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.209
 bombenfest 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.670
 Now I just want the people here 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.500
 I do not have to go back to the front 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.010
 always start again and compensate 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.549
 The drill is just as wide again 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.019
 air the hole here then if I am here 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.720
 drill two larger holes 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.660
 Here at the end then I will just join 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.730
 Turn the opening completely aside 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.180
 easy and then it really should 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.950
 Almost finished 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.469
 yes, that's how it looks 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.930
 cut out on here I just have to 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.719
 make two books 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.560
 I'm going to fix it all now 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:23.610
 Then we'll meet again people is 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.930
 finished the gear works 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.300
 is wonderful 3 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.590
 it has in two or grinds the 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.190
 I have screws here in the carbon 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.360
 sunk but unfortunately I did not go 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.190
 Did not want more than half 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.810
 drill 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.650
 that would be solved differently would be here 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.949
 such rubber mats with 2 mm 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.820
 interpose then the plate 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.680
 here too steamed and yes I would 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.150
 fix it here now i already have it 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.949
 be marked precisely again 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:05.190
 The pole with some players do not have 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:06.900
 Too much to be tight and yes I would 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.430
 probably tie that up now and 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.500
 then i will power the electricity here 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.250
 but I will do that in the next one 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.250
 to make a video 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.240
 yes and then we can already 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.530
 with the keys with buttons if we have this 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.400
 then we can see how 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.400
 that I turn 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:31.250
 or I can do that to you now 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.250
 that it works 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 OK 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.069
 yes grind it or that was that 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.389
 most important that the distances are taken 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.789
 are not that of the plate 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:07.360
 is done 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.009
 but it all worked and yes 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.289
 i would say i fix that and 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.520
 See you in the next video and then 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.520
 I show you the finished result
