00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello friends this video is to install an emulator called mame a 32 that emulates 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.790
 the games of the recreational machines 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.850
 we open the link that is in more information on the taringa page 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.109
 we go down 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.729
 where he says that china is 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 we give in the inpe download 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.259
 in the page of half spain and we give you click on your be dunga like me 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.350
 I use google co 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.450
 a melon download directly if you use internet explorer will come out to open 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.110
 save or cancel you give to save 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.620
 then we go to the page romo styler to download a game we choose a letter 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.990
 in this case the ce 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.980
 we go down and choose a game for example cadillacs and dinosaurs 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.920
 now in domino actis rom 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.960
 we have to wait 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.650
 about 15 seconds and then give it in turn to start the download 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 7 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.320
 6 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 3 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.509
 we look for the file that we download and we give in extract in maui 32 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.590
 finished the extraction we opened the folder more than a 32 and we met 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.400
 many files including the emulator 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.580
 now we're going to the theft folder which is where we will put all the games that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.700
 download there we drag our game that we downloaded earlier 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 before opening the emulator 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.490
 I recommend buying a remote for PC costs around 12 euros 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 you connect it and then you open the emulator 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.349
 the first b be a little bit open, remember to connect the control first 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.650
 before starting so recognizes it I use a playstation 2 control adapter to 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 vs b 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.669
 the emulator is pretty good I've tried it with two players 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.029
 there are games that can play three or even four like the simpsons but I do not 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 I've tried them 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.179
 after two months it finally opened 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.139
 do not worry then start faster 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.719
 the bar below is that the game directory is being updated 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.719
 look for the roms that you are adding 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.719
 on the taringa page where we download the emulator there are many pax 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.769
 of blues or games 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 downloads and the bugs in the rocks folder 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.799
 we write in the search bar the name of a game in this case 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 cadillacs and dinosaurs 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.979
 and we give to litigation or double click what they like most 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.369
 once it is loaded 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:31.759
 will come out a blue box tells you that to exit you must use the escape key to 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.579
 continue either you believe oquelí or with the command move left and right 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.400
 now we must configure the buttons for it we press the case key to 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.399
 the one who does not know which is bordering the capital block 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.699
 a menu goes out we click on pulpí sgaim 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.169
 there we change a 'player' to be pressing triangle and then the 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.439
 button to be the same with tail 1 triangle and in the command for example 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.379
 follow 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.999
 after button 1 and vote 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.870
 2 in the same way triangle and then the button you want it to be 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.759
 to exit the menu press escape only twice or you will leave the game 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.919
 with the select button you add credits then I would be playing 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.120
 p 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.679
 the p key is the palau se and it's kate out 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:20.279
 I hope you liked it
