00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
was this game about was it what you
wanted<00:01:20.700> against<00:01:21.210> cloud<00:01:21.420> nine<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
wanted against cloud nine it's what you

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.330 
wanted against cloud nine it's what you
thought<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> table

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
thought you can get around the table

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
thought you can get around the table
with<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> guys<00:01:23.700> control<00:01:24.180> dragons<00:01:24.720> controlled

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
with you guys control dragons controlled

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140 
with you guys control dragons controlled
the<00:01:25.290> whole<00:01:25.320> game<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.130> saw<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.340> completely

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the whole game we saw a completely

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600 
the whole game we saw a completely
different<00:01:27.540> gravity<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.049> day<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.470> um<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
different gravity from day one um I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
different gravity from day one um I
think<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.060> cloud<00:01:30.299> 9's<00:01:30.600> fault<00:01:30.810> because

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
think it's more cloud 9's fault because

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
think it's more cloud 9's fault because
they<00:01:31.380> felt<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.430> disrespected<00:01:33.060> us

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
they felt like they like disrespected us

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.510 
they felt like they like disrespected us
because<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.409> picked<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.189> damage

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because they they picked a to damage

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.039 
because they they picked a to damage
comp<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.479> cog<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
comp like all they have is cog is not

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
comp like all they have is cog is not
mobile<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.590> orey's<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.009> mobile<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mobile and orey's not mobile and I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
mobile and orey's not mobile and I
already<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> locked<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.860> have

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
already have I locked in and we have

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
already have I locked in and we have
Kassadin<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
Kassadin and we can like to we have the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
Kassadin and we can like to we have the
counter<00:01:43.380> pickle<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.680> fifth<00:01:43.920> pick<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.149> think

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
counter pickle in fifth pick so i think

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.520 
counter pickle in fifth pick so i think
cloud<00:01:45.570> nine<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.960> messed<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> band

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
cloud nine really messed up in the band

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
cloud nine really messed up in the band
pick<00:01:46.680> phase<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.880> guys<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.180> dignitas<00:01:48.659> coming

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
pick phase you guys have dignitas coming
