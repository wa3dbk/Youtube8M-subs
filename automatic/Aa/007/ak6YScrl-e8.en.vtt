I<00:02:53.280> think<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> early<00:02:54.090> e-types<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.020> get

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I think for the early e-types you get

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.770 
I think for the early e-types you get
the<00:02:55.290> same<00:02:55.470> experience<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.390> experience<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.750> new

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
entry pattern but I'm guessing it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.650 
entry pattern but I'm guessing it's
going<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.360> be<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> similar<00:03:00.840> thing<00:03:00.990> again

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
