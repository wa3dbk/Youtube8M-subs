00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
seventy five thousand miles so what

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.450 
seventy five thousand miles so what
causes<00:00:40.950> these<00:00:41.399> leaks<00:00:42.829> crankset<00:00:43.829> seals<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
causes these leaks crankset seals can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069 
causes these leaks crankset seals can
harden<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> lose<00:00:45.210> their<00:00:45.420> flexibility

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
harden and lose their flexibility

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
harden and lose their flexibility
causing<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> crack<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> leak<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
causing them to crack and leak this is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
causing them to crack and leak this is
particularly<00:00:48.870> bad<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> extreme

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
particularly bad and extreme

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
particularly bad and extreme
temperatures<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> gaskets<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.260> become<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
temperatures and gaskets can become a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250 
temperatures and gaskets can become a
little<00:00:52.739> brittle<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.079> does

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little brittle over time so what does

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.010 
little brittle over time so what does
royal<00:00:55.500> purple<00:00:55.800> hmx<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
royal purple hmx do for you think of it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
royal purple hmx do for you think of it
like<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.379> leather<00:00:58.620> jacket<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> use

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
like that leather jacket that you use

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
like that leather jacket that you use
conditioner<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> keep<00:01:00.449> soft<00:01:00.780> hmx<00:01:01.739> does<00:01:01.920> the

conditioner on to keep soft hmx does the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
conditioner on to keep soft hmx does the
same<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> seals<00:01:03.000> internally<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
same thing for the seals internally in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.250 
same thing for the seals internally in
your<00:01:03.780> motor

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
your motor

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
your motor
it<00:01:04.409> gives<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:05.040> flexibility<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.420> gives

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it gives them flexibility and it gives

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.270 
it gives them flexibility and it gives
them<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> ability<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.680> their<00:01:07.799> job<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
them the ability to do their job and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
them the ability to do their job and
stop<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> leaks<00:01:09.030> before<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.750> oil<00:01:09.930> ends<00:01:10.170> up

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
stop the leaks before that oil ends up

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.070 
stop the leaks before that oil ends up
