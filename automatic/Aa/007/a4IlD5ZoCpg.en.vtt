 new territories and new hearts and souls 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.029
 even associates of pagan rulers 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 renounced their gods for the sake of the Lord 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.339
 Our Jesus Christ 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 so is the notable warlord Mauritius that 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.740
 served the emperor maximon arrogant 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.110
 Christian persecutor turned to faith 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.560
 Christ along with his warriors and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.380
 open and spread maximian 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 such a betrayal furious and so and

 unable to break their firm faith 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 doomed warriors to terrible torture first 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 right before the eyes of the mind in the river was 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.810
 beheaded son of his own 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.840
 but the Mauritius thanked the gentlemen for 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.450
 that he accepted the martyr to himself then 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 Mauritius of all his warriors brought on 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.140
 the swamp where the clouds swarmed wasps and gadflies yes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.290
 mosquitoes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 tied to the trees before plastered them 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.039
 honey for 10 days warriors languished under 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.880
 the furious stings of insects from starvation 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.759
 and thirst 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.100
 only constant prayer to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.630
 God helped them survive all these 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.929
 terrible suffering 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 then the lord freed the glorious warriors 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:31.770
 from body agony and took a shower and them to yourself 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.469
 and the evil tormentor Maximian could not do anything 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.319
 stop he ordered to cut off all 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.420
 warrior heads to throw their bodies without 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.819
 burials but at night 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:49.189
 the martyrs of the Mauritius of his warriors on the spot 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.189
