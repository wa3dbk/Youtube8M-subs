00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.369
 when the expectations of the new 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.070
 mercedes s-class were not already high 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 They were there at the latest in the course of this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.869
 in the evening because it took quite a long time 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030
 until the world premiere finally 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.980
 a car was allowed to drive on the stage 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 that was partly the hamburger 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 schietwetter owed that that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 mercedes flagship with pouring 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.030
 rain in the Hanseatic city has welcomed 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.640
 why Hamburg, of all places 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 have probably through fantastic city with 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
 a lot of media 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.339
 and of course we have the tight one 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.659
 relationship with to airbus and is once 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.509
 first class vehicle first class airbus 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.400
 plane fits very well together and me 

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:09.979
 In that sense, there is a good one 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.979
 symbiosis the new class 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 The class is the most successful 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.910
 Luxury limousine of the world and she is in front 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 the most important symbol for the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.060
 Daimler-Group 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 therefore, it was not smashed 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.840
 but drunk 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 the presentation of the most important 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.210
 Mercedes models was impressive 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 the car itself is also above all else 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.710
 the technologies that are in it 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.470
 just one example is the magic body 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.320
 Control the bumps on the road 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.330
 recognizes it reacts and so the s 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.060
 class as on cloud should float 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.820
 lets or gives up completely 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.890
 So incandescent summarized so far 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.460
 Do you have luxury and comfort on the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 security 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.369
 they have first class mobility but the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.560
 s class must also apply thick 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.630
 she has a reputation to lose or 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.180
 at least a primitive position 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.370
 the claims are accordingly high 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.220
 we are already with the s-class today 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.630
 been world market leader with age bracket 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.670
 even in the late cycle of the s-class 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 Of course, the age group is clear 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.480
 targeted with the new s-class 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.610
 to be the market leader in the bloody world 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 when it comes down to it the pompous one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.299
 is celebrated world premiere is the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.299
 already done it for the beginning
