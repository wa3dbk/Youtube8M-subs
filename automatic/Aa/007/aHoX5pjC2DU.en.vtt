honestly a very awesome passive skill
I'm<00:02:12.930> especially<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.350> start<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.980> use<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
I'm especially when you start to use the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940 
I'm especially when you start to use the
skill<00:02:15.760> more<00:02:15.940> effectively<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.810> you'll<00:02:17.680> kind

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
skill more effectively and you'll kind

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.979 
skill more effectively and you'll kind
of<00:02:18.010> see<00:02:18.069> as<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> game<00:02:18.580> goes<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.660> dash

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
of see as the game goes on you can dash

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.990 
of see as the game goes on you can dash
and<00:02:20.470> when<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.709> dash<00:02:20.980> through<00:02:21.370> someone<00:02:21.819> you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and when you dash through someone you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.930 
and when you dash through someone you
reactivate<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> dash<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.560> second<00:02:23.920> time<00:02:24.100> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
reactivate the dash for a second time so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
reactivate the dash for a second time so
you<00:02:25.000> dash<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.900> hit<00:02:26.050> someone<00:02:26.440> and

you dash you can hit someone and
activate<00:02:27.010> rising<00:02:27.430> tide<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:28.060> dashing<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.720> and
