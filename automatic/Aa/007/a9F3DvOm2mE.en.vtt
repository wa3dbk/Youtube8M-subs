00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.499 
glimmer glass and the cool thing about
this<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.429> lot<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> control

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
this is now I can have a lot of control

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.509 
this is now I can have a lot of control
over<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.079> want<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> final<00:02:08.129> image<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
over what I want in the final image and

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.839 
over what I want in the final image and
can<00:02:08.640> change<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.060> creatively<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.580> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
can change it up creatively so on this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.199 
can change it up creatively so on this
one<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> used<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:15.110> little<00:02:16.110> bit<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.640> alright<00:02:17.640> so

one I used a little bit more alright so
now<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.599> this<00:02:18.830> unique<00:02:19.830> look<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.360> could

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
now I have this unique look that I could

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.009 
now I have this unique look that I could
get<00:02:21.959> in<00:02:22.319> camera<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
get in camera but now I can do it in the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.210 
get in camera but now I can do it in the
in<00:02:25.260> post<00:02:25.829> so<00:02:26.400> play<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.349> turn<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.560> turn<00:02:29.160> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
in post so play that turn it on turn it

off yeah it updates immediately so in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.940 
off yeah it updates immediately so in
the<00:02:32.130> D<00:02:32.459> FX<00:02:32.640> interface<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.769> over<00:02:34.799> here

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the D FX interface I can go over here

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.620 
the D FX interface I can go over here
and<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:36.000> know<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> changed<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
and you know I changed some of the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.059 
and you know I changed some of the
parameters<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.410> come<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.680> and

call it whatever I want glimmer glass 1

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.640 
call it whatever I want glimmer glass 1
and<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.180> save<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.840> pops<00:02:43.019> up<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.349> here

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
and I can save and it pops up right here

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
time so this is a new thing for tiffin

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.140 
time so this is a new thing for tiffin
that<00:02:52.980> haven't<00:02:53.160> even<00:02:53.250> really<00:02:53.519> done<00:02:53.640> plug-ins

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that haven't even really done plug-ins

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.750 
that haven't even really done plug-ins
before<00:02:54.420> or<00:02:54.629> or<00:02:55.500> how<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:55.769> yeah<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.579> is<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
before or or how they yeah this is a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660 
before or or how they yeah this is a
version<00:02:57.090> 4<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.900> all<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.250> filters

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
version 4 so we have all the the filters

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.090 
version 4 so we have all the the filters
that<00:03:00.030> tiffin<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.510> known<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:01.079> but<00:03:01.799> we<00:03:01.889> can<00:03:02.010> do

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
that tiffin is known for but we can do

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.430 
that tiffin is known for but we can do
it<00:03:02.190> digitally<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.690> that's<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.170> what<00:03:04.350> I've

it digitally so that's that's what I've
been<00:03:04.530> using<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.859> for<00:03:04.889> it's<00:03:05.160> giving<00:03:05.730> me<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.819> lot

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
been using it for it's giving me a lot

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.030 
been using it for it's giving me a lot
of<00:03:06.060> room<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.630> post<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.319> play<00:03:07.530> with<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.889> and

of room and post to play with it and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.670 
of room and post to play with it and
shoot<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:09.000> raw<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.630> options<00:03:10.410> in

shoot it really raw so I have options in

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.129 
shoot it really raw so I have options in
the<00:03:10.769> end<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.519> love<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.359> yeah

the end and it I love it so yeah
obviously<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.859> guys<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.099> known<00:03:14.220> for<00:03:14.250> your

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
obviously you guys are known for your

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.509 
obviously you guys are known for your
physical<00:03:15.090> filters<00:03:15.680> what's<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.859> advantage<00:03:17.190> or

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
physical filters what's the advantage or

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
physical filters what's the advantage or
disadvantage<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:18.000> applying<00:03:18.420> those<00:03:18.540> filters

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
disadvantage of applying those filters

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.680 
disadvantage of applying those filters
in<00:03:19.139> posts<00:03:19.560> versus<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.790> matte<00:03:20.940> box<00:03:21.120> well

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
in posts versus in a matte box well

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.569 
in posts versus in a matte box well
several<00:03:22.079> advantages<00:03:22.380> for<00:03:22.859> instance<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.370> you

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
several advantages for instance if you

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.430 
several advantages for instance if you
actually<00:03:24.269> captured<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> filter<00:03:25.290> on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
actually captured with the filter on

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.770 
actually captured with the filter on
your<00:03:25.470> lens<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:27.150> didn't<00:03:27.389> have<00:03:27.540> enough

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
your lens and you didn't have enough

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.720 
your lens and you didn't have enough
filtration<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> time<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.130> shoot<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.579> can

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
filtration at the time of shoot you can

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.129 
filtration at the time of shoot you can
come<00:03:29.910> back<00:03:30.060> into<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.450> software<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.019> add

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
come back into this software and add

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.620 
come back into this software and add
more<00:03:31.380> which<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.919> a<00:03:31.950> great<00:03:32.340> benefit<00:03:32.760> also<00:03:33.450> too

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
more which is a great benefit also too

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.809 
more which is a great benefit also too
it<00:03:33.780> takes<00:03:34.200> out<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.380> lot<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.739> guessing<00:03:35.220> not

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
it takes out a lot of the guessing not

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.000 
it takes out a lot of the guessing not
it's<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.329> complimentary<00:03:37.049> process<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.889> if

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
it's a complimentary process so if

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.309 
it's a complimentary process so if
you're<00:03:38.160> trying<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.700> pre<00:03:39.030> visualize<00:03:39.510> what<00:03:40.139> your

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
you're trying to pre visualize what your

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.270 
you're trying to pre visualize what your
scene<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.769> look<00:03:40.889> like<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> what

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
scene is going to look like and what

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.460 
scene is going to look like and what
glass<00:03:41.730> filter<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.269> might<00:03:42.480> want<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.930> you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
glass filter you might want to have you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.750 
glass filter you might want to have you
have<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> opportunity<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.250> take<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> like<00:03:44.730> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
