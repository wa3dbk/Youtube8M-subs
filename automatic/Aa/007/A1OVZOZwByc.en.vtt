00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.849
What you remember five or ten years down the road is the relationships you

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.200
had, especially being a part of a
football team.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880
I don't think either one

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.220
of us would probably change anything
that we've done. I mean yeah, you'd love

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.189
to change the scoreboard here and there,
but of the things that we couldn't

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.530
control, wouldn't go back and change a thing. I had been fortunate enough to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.370
get the LSB scholarship here at Lawrence,
so last summer I interned at a private

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.510
equity firm in Boston, so I was, you know,
as a math Econ double major, like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.480
I'm trying to get into the world of
investments, and it might seem

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.379
counterintuitive but I think being on
the football team actually helps you as

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.489
a student. You're very focused on
everything including academics, I think

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
it really helps. My plan coming into college was I wanted to get

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.470
my chemistry degree and become a
chemical engineer, but at the same time, I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.869
wasn't aware that playing at the next
level would be an option, and these guys

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.799
have set a great example. I wouldn't have
thought that coming in my freshman year,

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.200
my senior year I'd be playing in a game
in Mexico like that's crazy. The game's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.759
called "TazÃ³n de Estrellas" which is
"Bowl of Stars," and the whole idea is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.619
you get a bunch of Division 3
all-stars to represent team USA.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
Then Saturday you get to play Team
Mexico, you know, we're fortunate enough

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.229
to win that game. And then, our offensive
coordinator down there in Mexico just

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.979
after that game was like, "Do you want to
play in Europe?" I'm like, honestly,

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.380
didn't even know. I didn't know what to
say to him really at that point in time.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
I would relish at that opportunity, I
really would. Football's not a game you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.210
can just give up, it's really one
that's taken away from you.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.240
For me, coming to Lawrence, I
had a great opportunity to play. I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.299
feel like for my freshman year up until
now, the program has just changed so much, and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.640
there's such a sense of brotherhood on
the team.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.740
Being at a place like Lawrence you know, you don't come here for 4 years and just play football,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.360
you don't come here for 4 years just to party, you come here for 4 years and then set

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.780
yourself up for the rest of your entire
life. We're in that "College that Change

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.530
Lives" book. I think that is so accurate. I
feel like where I was when I was a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
freshman, compared to where I am now,
there's a huge difference, and you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.269
know, I've got a bunch of friends from
high school go to other places, and I

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.700
don't think that they would necessarily
say that about their experiences. So I

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.420
mean, I think Lawrence is a place
that changes you and I think that what

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.989
I'll never forget is, you know, these
guys. If I can go back and do it a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.819
100 times over, it would be 100 times at Lawrence. To meet these

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.000
guys, to play on this team, to be a part
of this community, it's just been amazing.
