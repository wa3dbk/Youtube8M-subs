do<00:00:11.320> understand<00:00:11.799> the<00:00:12.009> color<00:00:12.160> scheme<00:00:12.429> is<00:00:12.610> based

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
do understand the color scheme is based

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
do understand the color scheme is based
on<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.440> concept<00:00:14.889> of<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.339> first<00:00:15.610> movie<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:15.969> the

on the concept of the first movie of the
ratchet<00:00:17.500> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:19.060> that's<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:19.510> think<00:00:19.599> that's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
ratchet I think that's I think that's

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.179 
ratchet I think that's I think that's
what<00:00:19.990> he's<00:00:20.080> based<00:00:20.260> off<00:00:20.410> anyway<00:00:20.679> if<00:00:21.039> you've

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
what he's based off anyway if you've

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.160 
what he's based off anyway if you've
seen<00:00:21.340> some<00:00:21.460> of<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.609> concept<00:00:21.970> art<00:00:22.170> I'll

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
thought I would actually in fact between

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.299 
thought I would actually in fact between
the<00:00:39.449> original<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.350> one<00:00:41.559> I<00:00:41.829> really<00:00:41.860> don't

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
the original and this one I really don't

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.939 
the original and this one I really don't
know<00:00:42.399> who<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:42.670> actually<00:00:42.820> like<00:00:43.059> better<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.890> is

just a very very nicely done figure and
awesome<00:00:48.010> awesome<00:00:48.219> repaint<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.969> I<00:00:49.480> was<00:00:49.600> also

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
awesome awesome repaint and I was also

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.930 
awesome awesome repaint and I was also
lucky<00:00:49.960> enough<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.410> get<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.859> figure<00:00:51.579> that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
lucky enough to get a figure that

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.790 
lucky enough to get a figure that
doesn't<00:00:52.239> have<00:00:52.420> many<00:00:52.690> paints<00:00:53.199> bloodied<00:00:53.500> on<00:00:53.559> it

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
doesn't have many paints bloodied on it

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.759 
doesn't have many paints bloodied on it
so<00:00:53.949> that's<00:00:54.160> kind<00:00:54.340> of<00:00:54.370> cool<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:56.590> they

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
so that's kind of cool you know they

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.290 
so that's kind of cool you know they
really<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.219> only<00:00:57.340> change<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:58.030> actual

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
really the only change to the actual

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.729 
really the only change to the actual
figure<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.750> that<00:00:58.780> he<00:00:58.930> comes<00:00:59.109> with<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.410> different

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
figure is that he comes with a different

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.910 
figure is that he comes with a different
make<00:00:59.920> tech<00:01:00.129> weapon<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.320> repaint<00:01:02.710> of

well which which I thought is a lot
better<00:01:18.159> actually<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.549> wish<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.909> just<00:01:19.119> repaint

this<00:01:19.689> they<00:01:20.020> could<00:01:20.170> have<00:01:20.259> just<00:01:20.290> repainted<00:01:20.770> this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.030 
this they could have just repainted this
gray<00:01:21.130> but<00:01:21.340> they<00:01:21.460> didn't<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:22.770> always<00:01:23.770> said<00:01:23.950> I'd

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
gray but they didn't I always said I'd

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.380 
gray but they didn't I always said I'd
really<00:01:24.490> think<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:24.880> one<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.210> best

used<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.399> silver<00:01:48.610> but<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.479> side<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.869> his<00:01:50.020> arms

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
used the silver but the side of his arms

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.289 
used the silver but the side of his arms
in<00:01:50.439> robot<00:01:50.740> mode<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.950> his<00:01:51.579> but<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.119> back<00:01:52.270> of

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
in robot mode and his but the back of

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.209 
in robot mode and his but the back of
his<00:01:52.509> feet<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.469> barely<00:01:53.649> get<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:53.979> any

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
different colors in robot mode besides

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.149 
different colors in robot mode besides
the<00:01:56.979> red<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.700> white<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.799> sucks

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the original like so and there is legs

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.600 
the original like so and there is legs
then<00:02:57.270> I'm<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:57.420> gonna<00:02:57.540> rotate<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.110> around

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
then I'm just gonna rotate this around

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.820 
then I'm just gonna rotate this around
rotate<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> head<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.380> fold<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.590> chess

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
rotate out the head and fold the chess

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.190 
rotate out the head and fold the chess
piece<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.700> lock<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.960> by<00:03:04.140> doing

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
piece down you can lock it in by doing

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800 
piece down you can lock it in by doing
that<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:05.670> I'm<00:03:06.000> gonna<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.450> gonna<00:03:06.570> push

that then I'm gonna do is gonna push
these<00:03:06.990> arms<00:03:07.290> forward<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.770> bit<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.730> do

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
these arms forward a little bit they do

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.140 
these arms forward a little bit they do
click<00:03:09.120> into<00:03:09.660> place<00:03:10.190> then<00:03:11.190> you're<00:03:11.730> gonna<00:03:11.850> fold

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.460 
click into place then you're gonna fold
around<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> arms<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.650> rotate<00:03:14.580> these<00:03:14.760> around

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
around the arms and rotate these around

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.020 
around the arms and rotate these around
like<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:18.860> then<00:03:19.860> what<00:03:20.070> almost<00:03:20.730> done<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
like so and then what almost done just

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.720 
like so and then what almost done just
need<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.480> take<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.810> flip<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.410> up<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
need to take this flip this up here and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.750 
need to take this flip this up here and
there<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.690> specialist<00:03:25.200> ratchet<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:26.160> his

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
there is that specialist ratchet in his

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.850 
there is that specialist ratchet in his
robot<00:03:27.420> now<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> robot<00:03:28.110> mode<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.320> really<00:03:28.709> where

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
robot now the robot mode is really where

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.380 
robot now the robot mode is really where
the<00:03:28.890> figure<00:03:29.220> shines<00:03:29.520> even<00:03:29.790> more<00:03:30.150> than<00:03:30.300> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
the figure shines even more than the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.650 
the figure shines even more than the
original<00:03:30.810> what<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.739> really<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.100> about<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.660> is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
original what I really like about it is

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.240 
original what I really like about it is
the<00:03:33.900> fact<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.230> he<00:03:34.380> has<00:03:34.500> got<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:34.920> tight

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the fact that he has got really tight

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.000 
the fact that he has got really tight
joints<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.560> legs<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
joints on you know on the legs and the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.960 
joints on you know on the legs and the
arms

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
arms

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
arms
my<00:03:39.270> original<00:03:39.480> ratchet<00:03:40.110> didn't<00:03:40.320> have<00:03:40.500> very

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
my original ratchet didn't have very

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.020 
my original ratchet didn't have very
tight<00:03:40.950> joints<00:03:41.340> his<00:03:41.459> arms<00:03:41.730> were<00:03:41.790> kind<00:03:41.970> of

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
tight joints his arms were kind of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.509 
tight joints his arms were kind of
flopping<00:03:42.360> everywhere<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:43.890> one<00:03:44.100> has<00:03:44.370> got

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
flopping everywhere but this one has got

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.460

about it for Russia to robot mode sort

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.159 
about it for Russia to robot mode sort
of<00:05:25.879> getting<00:05:26.029> transformed<00:05:26.449> back<00:05:26.659> into<00:05:27.050> his

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
of getting transformed back into his

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.240 
of getting transformed back into his
vehicle<00:05:27.289> mode<00:05:27.529> it's<00:05:27.860> just<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.069> same<00:05:28.219> as

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
vehicle mode it's just the same as

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.990 
vehicle mode it's just the same as
before<00:05:29.830> fairly<00:05:30.830> simple<00:05:31.190> it's<00:05:31.430> gonna<00:05:31.520> rotate<00:05:31.789> a

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
before fairly simple it's gonna rotate a

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.219 
before fairly simple it's gonna rotate a
feet<00:05:32.240> around<00:05:32.440> alright<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.560> start<00:05:34.190> here<00:05:34.550> first

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
feet around alright to start here first

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.600 
feet around alright to start here first
it's<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.349> other<00:05:36.500> way<00:05:36.620> anyway<00:05:37.099> rotate<00:05:37.550> the

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
it's the other way anyway rotate the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.659 
it's the other way anyway rotate the
feet<00:05:37.639> around<00:05:38.029> like<00:05:38.419> so<00:05:38.690> I'm<00:05:39.409> peg<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.400> piece

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
feet around like so I'm peg that piece

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.909 
feet around like so I'm peg that piece
I'm<00:05:41.060> gonna<00:05:41.240> rotate<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.779> head<00:05:41.900> around<00:05:42.139> I'm

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
I'm gonna rotate the head around I'm

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.700 
I'm gonna rotate the head around I'm
gonna<00:05:43.099> let<00:05:43.279> this<00:05:43.370> piece<00:05:43.520> up<00:05:43.819> like<00:05:44.569> that<00:05:44.779> don't

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
gonna let this piece up like that don't

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.279 
gonna let this piece up like that don't
going<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:46.009> do<00:05:46.099> is<00:05:46.279> gonna<00:05:46.430> rotate<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:48.050> piece

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
going to do is gonna rotate that piece

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.850 
going to do is gonna rotate that piece
around<00:05:48.560> like<00:05:49.159> so<00:05:49.400> then<00:05:49.669> we<00:05:49.759> can<00:05:49.879> fold<00:05:50.150> out<00:05:50.860> the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
around like so then we can fold out the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.700 
around like so then we can fold out the
wheels<00:05:52.509> and<00:05:53.509> then<00:05:53.689> we're<00:05:53.810> gonna<00:05:53.900> do<00:05:54.110> is<00:05:54.439> we're

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
wheels and then we're gonna do is we're

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.640 
wheels and then we're gonna do is we're
going<00:05:54.949> to<00:05:55.120> rotate<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.360> arms<00:05:56.659> around<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.500> that

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
going to rotate the arms around so that

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.809 
going to rotate the arms around so that
forms<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:59.120> middle<00:05:59.539> part<00:05:59.839> of<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.960> car<00:06:00.819> yeah

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
forms the middle part of the car yeah

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.869 
forms the middle part of the car yeah
it's<00:06:02.089> them<00:06:02.240> again<00:06:02.479> oh<00:06:02.889> I<00:06:03.889> also<00:06:04.460> forgot<00:06:04.759> to

mention use of Autobot symbols on the

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.519 
mention use of Autobot symbols on the
sides<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:06.860> it's<00:06:07.009> a<00:06:07.129> rescue<00:06:08.139> yeah<00:06:09.139> for<00:06:09.349> that<00:06:09.439> to
