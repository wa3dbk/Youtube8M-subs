00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 to see teacher it is impossible to say now 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.750
 is that both can be improved by seeing 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.329
 the results obtained by the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.880
 school but if you are betting on a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.470
 new goals to some new objectives with 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.690
 look logically to keep progressing 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.050
 on the issue of the educational quality of 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.969
 this institution 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 you ask a primary school boy 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 our to a high school and they tell her 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 how do you feel 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.790
 we feel very superior 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.790
 there is a consciousness 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.650
 that every child who enters here knows that 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.290
 has a responsibility 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.960
 very superior and every time the promotions 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.450
 are better is an amazing thing and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.450
 because every 100 are getting better 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.019
 because there is a 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.380
 commitment to themselves consultations 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.460
 with reality 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.920
 and each promotion delivers many things 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.350
 many things are interesting 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.979
 in performance in the best promotions 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.979
 that we have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 for example 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.990
 of dylan who was the second student to 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.990
 Nacional level 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.299
 and awarded by the president the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.670
 Republic and the Minister of Education 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.380
 it is the sin of copetrol this decade of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 concrete list studying engineering 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 tractor 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.790
 with all expenses completely 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.220
 financed by the copetÃ³n and outside 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 be a bright student 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.060
 is monitor of the time is a boy 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.920
 I'm already pretty cool but because he had 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.540
 Good bases, good training 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.650
 a good structuring because they are 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.560
 girls that started that is from 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.290
 primary so is the oldest ones 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.220
 they feel heaven that the best 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.220
 they have given us why 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.349
 and here the quality will stand out 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.900
 academic because I'm product in the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.860
 human quality of active teachers 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.790
 teachers are not instructors are not 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.430
 pedagogues are not teachers are not 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 professors are master teachers in 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.049
 that sense the word and that take it 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.480
 internalized to the extent that they 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.100
 they commit and they fight they suffer a lot 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.400
 with the students 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.840
 they devote all the time in the world 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.910
 Saturdays on Sundays so that these 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 boys come out well formed then 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.690
 the human quality that just saves 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.360
 our teacher because I have are 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.550
 teachers I do not have I repeat you I do not have 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.760
 what educators I do not have a teacher I do not have 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.459
 instructors I do not have pedagogues 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.060
 and metaphysical and not in a sense 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.239
 dialectic of human quality 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 contained and expressed in knowledge 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.159
 of a lot of quality expression we 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.650
 manglio for giving an example of it is called 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.959
 the boys that is honesty but 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.040
 we do not show it to him in a word 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.860
 we seal an honesty of contents 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.620
 what does a boy taught the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.150
 honesty of content the internal and if 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.719
 what is huge this so that when 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.209
 come out public life do not be the cheat 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:32.280
 the one that just heard the word 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.819
 from which the word joins but its 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.500
 conscience is going to sting you do not do that in 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.689
 the school told you not to do them 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.129
 because they did honesty practices 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.129
 we do internships 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.000
 and is the loss of values which a 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:53.030
 or another way is crushing the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.819
 our society in the day 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.720
 at present and we see that those 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.620
 principles in their values 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.350
 that student commitment is going 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.320
 losing and we see that education the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.940
 Atlantic has decreased and maybe those 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.500
 insecurity rates logically have 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.750
 something to do precisely with the theme of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.160
 the training because the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.160
 home training 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.760
 at all levels it's not that it's 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.220
 only the political sector 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.150
 at all levels since 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 the military forces 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.610
 and large medium entrepreneurs 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.939
 businessmen 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.469
 it is a society that has internalized 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.840
 many the phenomena of corruption and 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.080
 do not 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.120
 we have to unfold that so that 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.330
 let's say the new generations 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.180
 repudiate those practices 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.000
 so that the new generations 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.580
 internalize that there are ways 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.310
 different human quality to live 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.500
 better because I can not live talking 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.050
 every day of the evils of the other and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.530
 the revolutions of the other I will feel 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.840
 very well when we all work because 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.520
 we all work for the good of all and 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.020
 that 's right, and we all work for the good of 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.510
 all because we are all honest and 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.010
 we are transparent that we can not say 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.810
 let's work for the good of all 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.870
 when we are making the trap when 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.360
 We are doing the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.660
 and when we speak double language or what 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.930
 that you do talk about the delay 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.440
 people try 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.930
 since we are small we are looking for 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.230
 teacher again I reiterate my congratulations 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.700
 and if you really succeed in this path of 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.980
 teaching on this path of the 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.390
 formation of the youth of the municipality 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.240
 of solitude of the Atlantic and all its 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.440
 surroundings very many thanks 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.639
 and the idea is that 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.879
 education in solitude 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.080
 better better slowly but that 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:59.020
 top 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.750
 that all this so that apparently 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.210
 this group that means a lot to 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.700
 us but that is small in all the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.680
 student volume 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.990
 students who have loneliness towards a 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.160
 reflection of what can be all loneliness 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.160
 committed as 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.859
 better conditions and diligent 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.609
 in all horizons if they deliver it 

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:26.609
 all the knowledge 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.370
 thanks to professor jorge towers what is 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.009
 the founding rector of the school 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.300
 metropolitan of solitude 2000 that today 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.680
 It does a recognition at the level 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.009
 national for dotcom contractors 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.009
