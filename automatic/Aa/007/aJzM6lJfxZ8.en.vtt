00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.290
 can find a very serious case since 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.870
 people who are being bathed for years 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.600
 big auto online I know it's a bit 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.869
 weird a bit weird is currently a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.850
 madness that you are going in for years objects 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.019
 without intending it's crazy that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.730
 is what we are going to talk about today 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 ok so in fort files before 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 of the jce ok you have to get to the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.090

 hit like and subscribe if you are new 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.309
 because there is a lot of daily content of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.469
 without the enzyme we start a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 user on twitter was reported saying 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.719
 that he had been shot had been 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.809
 placed as a bad player in grand theft 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.550
 auto 'online ok the most normal thing is that if 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 they place you as the player who is already 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 almost like a ban and they put you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.660
 about a week or two weeks 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 as a bad player up to a maximum of one month ok 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.480
 but this was not so this character is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.880
 360 user of 360 xbox 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.380
 public to the next image as well as 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.330
 see the next image these are in 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.710
 twitter posted the following and saying 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.100
 that your xbox 360 account would have 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 been placed as a bad player for 2 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.930
 years 9 months and 19 days remaining that was 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.910
 what he needed to be again 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.100
 a player not a normal player of 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.470
 big cars because seriously this is what 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.540
 weirder after what happened to mister 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.810
 TomÃ¡s that earned him the console during 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.480
 more than 20 years and now that they put you 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.160
 bad player for two years is 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.550
 very serious because you will not be able to play with 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.500
 people obviously with people who are 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.630
 normal I do not know you're going to meet people 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.360
 that you initial me from bad players and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.070
 Well, it's a bit screwed, it's exactly 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.890
 in French but how do you see the translation 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.840
 says he was banned opposite as bad 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.420
 player that is exactly the same as 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.530
 you go in ok for those who do not know in 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.410
 the bad players are the ones who have 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.240
 a hat that in a white hat this is 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.690
 identifies as a bad player and what 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.300
 does that text 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.550
 of the users where the people are or 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.350
 bad players or you can not get together 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.540
 with people who do not have that nice you're going 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.480
 to join with people who have the cone in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 your head and that exactly qualifies you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.080
