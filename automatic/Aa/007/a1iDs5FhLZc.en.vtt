how<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.609> better<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.250> cool<00:00:29.460> thing

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
how they better than that the cool thing

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.669 
how they better than that the cool thing
about<00:00:29.699> these<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
about these are is that they have a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.240 
about these are is that they have a
lower<00:00:32.160> voltage<00:00:32.489> per<00:00:33.000> cell<00:00:33.300> they're<00:00:33.770> 3.3<00:00:34.770> volts

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
lower voltage per cell they're 3.3 volts

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
lower voltage per cell they're 3.3 volts
per<00:00:35.850> cell<00:00:36.120> nominal<00:00:36.690> okay

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
per cell nominal okay

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
per cell nominal okay
these<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.739> two<00:00:37.950> cell<00:00:38.219> packs<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:38.850> makes

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
these are two cell packs which makes

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.920 
these are two cell packs which makes
them<00:00:39.300> 6.6<00:00:40.260> volt<00:00:40.500> phenomenal<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.809> other

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
them 6.6 volt phenomenal and the other

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
them 6.6 volt phenomenal and the other
thing<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:44.180> competing<00:00:45.180> compare<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
thing is that competing compare them to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
thing is that competing compare them to
all<00:00:46.020> other<00:00:46.350> receiver<00:00:47.010> packs<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.730> have

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
all other receiver packs these have

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.799 
all other receiver packs these have
extremely<00:00:48.690> high<00:00:48.899> energy<00:00:49.829> density<00:00:50.660> what<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
extremely high energy density what that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
extremely high energy density what that
means<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.890> lightweight<00:00:53.190> pack

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
means is it's a very lightweight pack

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.990 
means is it's a very lightweight pack
with<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> energy<00:00:55.110> packed<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.309> just

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
with a lot of energy packed into it just

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
with a lot of energy packed into it just
as<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.960> example<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.250> hold<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.670> one

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
as an example with you to hold this one

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.229 
as an example with you to hold this one
which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.480> our<00:01:00.690> bigger<00:01:00.960> pack<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.370> pick

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
which is our bigger pack and then pick

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
which is our bigger pack and then pick
this<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> similarly<00:01:05.070> sized

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
this up which is a similarly sized

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.270 
this up which is a similarly sized
nickel<00:01:06.240> metal<00:01:06.360> hydride<00:01:06.540> pack<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> you'll<00:01:08.040> see

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
nickel metal hydride pack and you'll see

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.630 
nickel metal hydride pack and you'll see
that<00:01:08.659> these<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.750> half<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.680> weight<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that these are half the weight for the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.600 
that these are half the weight for the
same<00:01:11.939> amount<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.390> energy<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.490> those

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
same amount of energy so look at those

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.140 
same amount of energy so look at those
if<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.689> siddhu's<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.790> 1,100<00:01:17.790> milliamp

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
if a siddhu's we have 1,100 milliamp

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.310 
if a siddhu's we have 1,100 milliamp
power<00:01:18.619> 1800<00:01:19.619> milliamp<00:01:20.040> power<00:01:20.750> 2100<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> all

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
power 1800 milliamp power 2100 and all

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
power 1800 milliamp power 2100 and all
the<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> 3200<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.759> they'll<00:01:23.939> handle

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the way up to 3200 so they'll handle

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.580 
the way up to 3200 so they'll handle
almost<00:01:24.330> any<00:01:24.720> aircraft<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.350> could<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
almost any aircraft you could it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.429 
almost any aircraft you could it
possibly<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> fly<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> other<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.140> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
possibly want to fly the other thing is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.789 
possibly want to fly the other thing is
is<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> thousand<00:01:31.470> cycles

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is that these will go a thousand cycles

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.760 
is that these will go a thousand cycles
in<00:01:32.100> other<00:01:32.189> words<00:01:32.400> thousand<00:01:33.119> charge/discharge

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
in other words thousand charge/discharge

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.090 
in other words thousand charge/discharge
cycles<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.979> absolutely<00:01:35.579> no<00:01:35.880> change<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
cycles with absolutely no change in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.230 
cycles with absolutely no change in
performance<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> twice<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.939> much<00:01:39.060> as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
performance for the twice as much as

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
performance for the twice as much as
mine<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.320> Camilla<00:01:40.700> absolutely<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
mine I can see the Camilla absolutely it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.950 
mine I can see the Camilla absolutely it
is<00:01:41.880> yes<00:01:42.180> tell<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> leads<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.500> them

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
is yes tell me about the leads to them

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
is yes tell me about the leads to them
it's<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.229> different<00:01:46.530> yeah<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it's a little different yeah it is and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.870 
it's a little different yeah it is and
what<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.200> two<00:01:50.040> universal

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
what we have here is is two universal

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.399 
what we have here is is two universal
connectors<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.930> would<00:01:52.049> normally

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
connectors just like you would normally

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.340 
connectors just like you would normally
plug<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.920> receiver<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.509> normal

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
plug into a receiver and so normal

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
plug into a receiver and so normal
installations<00:01:56.250> where<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
installations where you don't have a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
installations where you don't have a
real<00:01:57.090> high<00:01:57.240> current<00:01:57.630> draw<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.079> plug<00:01:58.290> just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
real high current draw you can plug just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
real high current draw you can plug just
one<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.549> any<00:01:59.579> other

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
one in just like you would any other

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.480 
one in just like you would any other
battery<00:02:00.390> pack<00:02:00.630> however<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.310> an

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
battery pack however if you get into an

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
battery pack however if you get into an
aircraft<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.229> current<00:02:04.619> draw

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
aircraft with a lot more current draw

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.440 
aircraft with a lot more current draw
you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.310> actually<00:02:05.670> plug<00:02:05.880> both<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.360> these

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you can actually plug both of these

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.139 
you can actually plug both of these
leads<00:02:06.840> directly<00:02:07.140> into<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.680> receiver

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
leads directly into your receiver

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
leads directly into your receiver
typically<00:02:09.149> you'd<00:02:09.300> plug<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:10.020> each<00:02:10.110> side

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
typically you'd plug one into each side

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.520 
typically you'd plug one into each side
of<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> power<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
of the power of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.370 
of the power of
and<00:02:12.310> that's<00:02:12.550> evenly<00:02:13.090> distributed<00:02:13.750> power<00:02:13.960> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
and that's evenly distributed power and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.870 
and that's evenly distributed power and
having<00:02:15.280> two<00:02:16.060> sets<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.480> wires<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.470> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
having two sets of wires going in is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.690 
having two sets of wires going in is
acting<00:02:18.880> like<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.450> larger<00:02:20.020> wire<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:21.310> other

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
acting like a one larger wire in other

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.130 
acting like a one larger wire in other
systems<00:02:22.150> where<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.390> might<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:22.630> some<00:02:22.900> sort<00:02:23.020> of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
systems where we might have some sort of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.050 
systems where we might have some sort of
power<00:02:23.290> expander<00:02:24.100> things<00:02:24.460> like<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.940> are

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
power expander things like that that are

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.490 
power expander things like that that are
set<00:02:25.270> for<00:02:25.510> Dean's<00:02:25.720> connect<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.320> have<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
set for Dean's connect we have the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.990 
set for Dean's connect we have the
Dean's<00:02:26.710> ultra<00:02:27.040> connector<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.460> already<00:02:27.670> put<00:02:27.850> on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
Dean's ultra connector I already put on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.060 
Dean's ultra connector I already put on
it<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.380> use<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:29.950> you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
it and so you can just use that if you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.850 
it and so you can just use that if you
want<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.460> it's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.910> very<00:02:31.210> Universal<00:02:32.200> way<00:02:32.710> of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
want so it's a very Universal way of

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.320 
want so it's a very Universal way of
setting<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.250> up<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.910> know<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.150> real

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
setting it up you know it's real

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090 
setting it up you know it's real
convenient<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.960> modeler<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.890> then<00:02:36.010> of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
convenient for the modeler and then of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.700 
convenient for the modeler and then of
course<00:02:36.130> we<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.490> balance<00:02:36.880> connector<00:02:37.360> here

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
course we have a balance connector here

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.050 
course we have a balance connector here
for<00:02:38.710> charging<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.400> no<00:02:39.520> matter<00:02:39.640> what<00:02:39.880> power

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
for charging so no matter what power

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.580 
for charging so no matter what power

actually there is these packs are very
environmentally<00:02:54.340> friendly<00:02:54.940> there's<00:02:55.150> no

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
environmentally friendly there's no

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.820 
environmentally friendly there's no
caveum<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:55.930> cobalt<00:02:56.380> at<00:02:56.560> them

the<00:02:57.220> other<00:02:57.400> thing<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.030> makes<00:02:58.270> sets<00:02:58.540> them

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
the other thing that makes sets them

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.540 
the other thing that makes sets them
apart<00:02:58.750> from<00:02:58.990> other<00:02:59.200> lithium<00:02:59.920> technology

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
apart from other lithium technology

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.180 
apart from other lithium technology
battery<00:03:01.000> packs<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:02.380> these<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.740> extreme

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
battery packs is that these have extreme

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.460 
battery packs is that these have extreme
resistance<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.970> heating<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.110> there's<00:03:05.290> no

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
resistance to heating and so there's no

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.350 
resistance to heating and so there's no
fire<00:03:05.800> or<00:03:05.830> explosion<00:03:06.459> hazards<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:07.180> them

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
fire or explosion hazards with them

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
fire or explosion hazards with them
great<00:03:07.810> great

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
great great
