00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 today we are going to make a couscous and a little 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.370
 particular because we are going to do it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 inside of the courgettes are of the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.199
 we have dug up round zucchini and le 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.400
 let's go and give him a small one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.710
 steamed will be a cooking 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 pretty fast we get five 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 minutes and a little more here to the water than 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.329
 bubbles so let's go give it this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 cooking fast here or the middling 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 they put a bowl a little more 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 large and goes from shelling a little with a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.550
 little oil considered about one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 spoon a half tablespoon of oil 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.520
 see I try to do this job of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.719
 how you can knead slightly no 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 that's it then I made a broth of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 fish 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 here it's nice bills and I'm going to put it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 inside the couscous 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.689
 let's say I put it on the couscous 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.060
 I'm going to cover it and leave it here for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.729
 about a quarter of an hour we can 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 zucchini and let's go get a nice one 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.909
 pan put the oil and let's go to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.909
 prepare some garlic 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.250
 put the whole clove of garlic and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:42.010
 then we also prepare a clove 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:44.410
 of garlic that we are going to chop this it 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.300
 I'll post with the fish because if it is 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.490
 I now put the risk, of course 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.710
 that one goes from burning then goes by 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.790
 pull a little taste of the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.180
 fish 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.270
 here or some parsley we see only the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 the softer part then the leaflets e 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.600
 here too we are going to chop it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 quite finely 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.300
 when you see that the oil is hot 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.910
 so are all the bubbles around 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.650
 per year moved by fire because 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.870
 otherwise it risks being also 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.760
 too hot 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.520
 so let's start with the squid these are 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.070
 of the squid you see that we already have 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.430
 clean so let's cut a 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430
 slices 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.120
 this is also quite small 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.549
 very fast cooking and I will also cut a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.930
 half so they are then the smallest e 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.310
 we can put the zucchini inside 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.750
 more easily here we say that 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.840
 this is more than enough for 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.970
 fill our zucchini and let's go to 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.670
 put on the fire so we can 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 put the pan back to heat 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.320
 again and at this point we go 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.320
 also add the parsley 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.150
 we also remove the zucchini and go to 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.490
 prepare shrimp these are beautiful 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.590
 shrimp that we have already blossomed and 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:15.260
 we also removed the intestine e 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:17.690
 we sell to cut into small pieces e 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.990
 let's add at this point a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.990
 caraglio 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.380
 let's adjust some salt and let's go 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.430
 add some harris to this case 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.290
 of a particularly Berber brawl 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.550
 good but also fairly spicy 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.150
 half a bar spoon and to remove it 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.400
 whole clove of garlic that naturally 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.060
 no longer needed 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.640
 at this point we can also push 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.230
 let's check the couscous 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.140
 perfect then re-ignite immediately 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.980
 even the flame and I 'm not going to join the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.980
 squid I flavor well 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.420
 and already very good but even so this 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.810
 point should be spent and should be added 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.220
 the parsley we left from 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.380
 part 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.989
 this point we can only go to 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.510
 fill our gourds then let's give 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.320
 a nice clean that nice settled and 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.320
 let's fill up 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.530
 let's even put it upside down maybe 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.500
 for a few seconds, however, it drips a little 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:44.630
 here is a drop of oil on the bottom and 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:47.240
 then we go to fill here we are in this 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.910
 point we put a trickle of oil on the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.460
 bottom of a small cut na and let's go to 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.460
 arrange our zucchini 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:09.510
 so we cover a drop 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:13.380
 of a little bit of salt and let's go 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.380
 in the oven at 200 degrees for about 10 minutes 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.330
 time we say it becomes 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:25.260
 the skin is slightly crunchy 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:29.100
 courgettes outer are the courgettes 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.780
 almost ready so let's go for a 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.700
 little decoration a little toy then 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.670
 in the end not essential for the recipe 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.850
 but to sell it later the prettiest one 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.070
 drop of oil and then we go to skip the 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.270
 shrimp tails we left 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.520
 without waiting for the oil to become 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.250
 practically hot and now I can go 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.030
 also to pick up the zucchini you see 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.360
 in the end it has also become pretty 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.360
 cute to the hat 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.150
 here we take the most 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.950
 chubby I go to put a little bit 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:09.170
 of salt and this point we go to 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.170
 put just like decoration 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.110
 nice dish is appetite
