00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.570 
always being hidden I mean it was easier
to<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:19.390> get<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.630> than<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.650> probably<00:02:22.280> could

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
to get get to than this I probably could

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.800 
to get get to than this I probably could
have<00:02:22.640> done<00:02:22.730> with<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> soldering<00:02:23.420> iron<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.780> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
have done with a soldering iron but I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.350 
have done with a soldering iron but I
don't<00:02:23.959> want<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> damage<00:02:24.290> any<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.739> plastic

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
don't want to damage any of the plastic

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
don't want to damage any of the plastic
so<00:02:26.360> what<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:26.870> since<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.560> sticks<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.130> much

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so what this since it sticks up so much

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.550 
so what this since it sticks up so much
you're<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.760> really<00:02:28.940> careful<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you're going to be really careful that

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
you're going to be really careful that
you<00:02:30.680> don't<00:02:30.850> jiggle<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.090> cartridge<00:02:32.480> too<00:02:32.690> much

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
you don't jiggle the cartridge too much

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.660 
you don't jiggle the cartridge too much
and<00:02:33.080> reset<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> game<00:02:35.470> see<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.650> saves<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.280> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and reset the game see if it saves if it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.420 
and reset the game see if it saves if it
still<00:02:38.000> holds<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.300> save<00:02:38.480> right<00:02:38.690> away<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:40.190> there<00:02:40.400> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
still holds a save right away as there a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.620 
still holds a save right away as there a
little<00:02:40.580> control<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:44.000> solve<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.390> save

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
little control that we solve the save

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.240 
little control that we solve the save
let's<00:02:45.350> start<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.200> now<00:02:48.380> I'm<00:02:48.530> going<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.800> go

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
let's start with so now I'm going to go

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.630 
let's start with so now I'm going to go
resolder<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.030> okay<00:02:51.020> so<00:02:51.220> turn<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.400> volume

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
resolder that okay so turn on the volume

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.180 
resolder that okay so turn on the volume
here<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.390> had<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.020> volume<00:02:54.170> way<00:02:54.530> up<00:02:54.560> before

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
here I had the volume way up before

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.000 
here I had the volume way up before
because<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.580> did<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.630> did<00:02:57.530> try<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.830> on

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
because I did have it I did try it on

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.550 
because I did have it I did try it on
the<00:02:58.130> game<00:02:58.340> reset<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.959> don't<00:03:00.170> worry<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.440> was

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
octane bland right this time

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.759 
octane bland right this time
let's<00:03:59.150> see<00:03:59.269> if<00:03:59.329> we<00:03:59.419> remove<00:03:59.719> if<00:04:00.109> I<00:04:00.290> lose<00:04:00.590> it

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
let's see if we remove if I lose it

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.500 
let's see if we remove if I lose it
there<00:04:06.370> nope<00:04:07.370> we<00:04:07.549> didn't<00:04:07.760> lose<00:04:07.879> the<00:04:08.030> same<00:04:08.269> look

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510
