00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 video today we are on an application 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.540
 very bastard as always before 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 start selling the shell so many beautiful 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 let's look at his thumbs up 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.630
 we reach 8 thousand likes 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.510
 for the next video what to pronounce 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.609
 likes vabbÃ¨ said this I would say that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.539
 we can start it is better then 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 Today's applications are called 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.340
 fast pointer shown in the past 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.489
 but I have been and there will be a day 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.739
 new absurd questions to answer 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.559
 well what is this application in short 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.840
 There is a kind of quiz that you will see 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 how dumb we would be then wow 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.200
 in this sense there is one of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 applications more bastard bitches e 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.870
 idiots on the app store 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 so this looks good 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.300
 video 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.050
 he will practically ask us all questions 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 bastards to trap us 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.219
 yes because they get us into knowing each other 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.770
 questions I have answered in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.949
 past I can assure you that this 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 beautiful bitch application then said 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.580
 what else to say to say that we can 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 to begin this text is to see a little 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.210
 how much this application will give us 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.710
 probably very well let's start 31 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.450
 then through a series of questions 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 short and fun you'll get one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 evaluation of his intellect 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.810
 probably this evaluation will do 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.390
 shit, this is safe, that is me later 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 I see the video again, I see this one again 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.799
 early part and wide pink veils 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 reason why now a vote of shit 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.680
 we start very well this is a lot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.159
 difficult to respond to 50 seconds 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.220
 concentrated 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.040
 then we start if I tell you one of the sayings 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.600
 3 if I tell you 3 you have to say 3 feel with 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 four you have to say 77 I say 7 10 8 58 no 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 one to you letters 3 home and true three to three 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 letters four to seven letters la 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 then answer seven to five letters 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.140
 well when i meant this game 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.820
 he was a bastard 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 I meant exactly what this does 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.959
 pitfalls in the co said this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.900
 let's move on to the next question this is 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.400
 easy since then the driver of a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.170
 truck was traveling down a street a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.450
 unique sense in the sense with such then 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.670
 is going against traffic and crosses at least 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.959
 ten policemen because they don't stop him 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.610
 we seek the way of some doctors 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.300
 did not commit to perfection daily 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.000
 holiday 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 let's put exact b ah fuck was 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.860
 walking on the sidewalk 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.410
 if you realize he didn't mean it 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 the driver of a truck or the driver of a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.690
 truck driving a truck 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.600
 tell me if this application is not 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 so absolutely bastard it is 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.170
 let's continue this is easy good 15 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.580
 seconds 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 a man and his family own one 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.959
 single-storey house with floors 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.209
 pink walls and furniture glasses throughout 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.360
 the rose is the color is the scale but if of 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.040
 one floor as eva fanculo scale 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.150
 screwed this time I care about it is 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.160
 perfect the house a single floor because 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 he would have to need one 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.010
 indeed scale then this is a lot 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.500
 difficult even if you first give it to him 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.930
 I was 17 and next year I will have it 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.420
 20 when my birthday what it says 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 it is impossible first January 31 December 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.250
 if before then I was 17 then 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.459
 now I am 18 and next year I will have 20 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.090
 no it is impossible because otherwise i have to 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.709
 to force 19 so what you say is 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.760
 impossible, however, according to me 31 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.650
 December 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.640
 that's right because today is January 1st 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.799
 before yesterday so I was 17 years old 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.690
 Oh God, there was a bit of a problem 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.780
 however, in the end one can 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.090
 to arrive with a lot of luck 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.790
 this is easy is only 15 seconds 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.010
 let's start a steel ball there was 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.140
 faster in water 25 degrees o 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.940
 at least 5 degrees because having to travel 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.829
 a sphere would cry the same 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.810
 speed at minus 5 25 a steel ball 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.570
 away there were of changed to b 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.220
 rules on us had ass for less 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.049
 five degrees would make water impossible 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.060
 it would be frozen 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.950
 actually I hadn't thought of it but 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.769
 this was the correct answer 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.019
 well sometimes go to ass helps 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.799
 a lot at school doing so is in fact 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.110
 I was always promoted to boys 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.879
 do not like me but this is a bit 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.599
 difficult 30 seconds 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:32.280
 we leave very quickly to 1040 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:37.620
 added another thousand are 2040 still 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:42.060
 32.070 still another thousand 3.070 more 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.639
 23.090 other 1400 milan still boasts 10 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.199
 4 years and 4.100 this knows a loved one 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.120
 friend and you didn't screw me because 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.940
 almost like a mental game 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 I had seen bottura focus and the 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.210
 most of them did not play there 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.550
 we belong a lot of people think 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.229
 5,000 because instead of adding the ten 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.690
 add up I do not know a hundred it goes well well it is 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.509
 intriguing is what if this is easy 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.669
 at 20 seconds perfect can a man who 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.860
 lives in mexico being buried in the 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.500
 united states depends on where it resides in 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.259
 his family is opposed but if he lives in 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.120
 mexico because it must be buried no 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.340
 exactly it is alive and it seems to me enough 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.669
 logical that is to ask if p 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.130
 bury the living person unless 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.770
 don't be a crazy drought maniac in that 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.659
 in case yes this is easy at 15 seconds 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.029
 how long it must cook an egg 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.250
 hard zero minutes fifteen minutes 5 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.620
 minutes well if a hard-boiled egg means that 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.539
 it is already cooked maybe then zero minutes 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.669
 He didn't screw me. I don't mind 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.279
 controller a golden jump weapon 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.469
 become too good for the ground well 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:51.430
 the last question is thirty seconds 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.930
 3 2 1 how many balls with 10 cm diameter 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.270
 you can put them in an empty box 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.090
 with the 100 centimeters of Rome 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.150
 maria is not for me i would put how many 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.680
 balls with helix i'm understanding a cock 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.620
 I don't know I think the answer 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.860
 right is one is set apart from 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.949
 first box is no longer empty 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.590
 well as you see the golden method 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.969
 throw yourself back to fucking a dog when you don't 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.479
 has no idea what the is 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:22.270
 correct answer usually works is 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.819
 experimented so we can see the 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.900
 final result and let's see how many 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:34.870
 our intelligence 8 correct answers 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:37.330
 on 10 wow well this time it has it 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.060
 screwed I was never incredibly 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.120
 a similar thing happened ie I have to 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.669
 go to celebrate or you're girls later 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.729
 having beaten the tomtom etro at last 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.939
 with 8 correct answers out of 10 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.009
 I am very satisfied with these 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.800
 the real satisfactions of precarious life 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.120
 these applications bastard and therefore 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.979
 I hope you enjoyed the video how 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.150
