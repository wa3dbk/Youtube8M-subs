00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Tells the truth in some churches 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.060
 they prohibit make-up in the truth if I 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.060
 cap peco against god 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.039
 not that machine criteria my criteria but 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.079
 my criterion is that not in any way 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.429
 in fact when the Bible the passage that 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.050
 Juan Carlos mentioned a moment ago 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.360
 of first of pedro chapter 23 and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.809
 first pedro chapter 3 that is not 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.730
 talking about censoring hairstyles the one 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.980
 the woman is obsessed that the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.449
 Woman is beautiful is not censoring 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.489
 of that in no way what the 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.129
 bible is saying is that the way in 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.229
 that woman win her husband is not 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.989
 priority with that but with its 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:54.049
 respectful breed behavior and details 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.290
 that there are added is very particular of 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:00.320
 some churches but it is not biblical the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.360
 limit a woman to be makeup 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.549
 languages ​​well I tell the sisters 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 look pretty for your husband or get 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.780
 pretty for god graceful walk is am 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.080
 the temple of the holy holy spirit that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.020
 lest 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.910
 and not a vanity disease that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 the woman if she is not makeup then 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.630
 she is not happy but that the women 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.750
 take care in the same way as men 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.870
 we have the right to take care of them but here you 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.410
 you say is my opinion that is not biblical is 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.850
 support is not that they have a position and 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.830
 the ideas that this position has what 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.210
 based on biblical passages or the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.040
 interpretation they give you and the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 interpreted my conviction my conviction 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.000
 my conviction biblical conviction is of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.160
 that when they come out with a gesture that the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.170
 woman does not put on make-up there is no argument 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.410
 biblical that can validate that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.510
 but when I say my opinion I think about the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.150
 way of thinking of different churches 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.840
 mine I think that she is very attached to 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.390
 word 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.939
 and there they too they 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.250
 that there are no arguments no arguments 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.960
 biblical at least but surely 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.700
 we had a pastor here of those 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.110
 churches we used one hour them 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.819
 arguing with biblical foundation and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.290
 also for sale that is spoken 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.670
 ask a lot through facebook and 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.630
 if they are questions of every day that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 do 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.880
 I do not think that skill 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.350
 allows because what he says today is that 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.480
 your is good or is the external 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.030
 ostentatious hairstyles he showed 21 says 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.640
 combed hairstyles is not bad but what 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.710
 bad is to be ostentatious yes sir the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 Luxurious dresses dressing is not bad what 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.300
 bad would be that a luxurious dress all the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.630
 bible and if it allows you to be in a 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.740
 nice dress that has an ornament 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.060
 nice to have an acceptable hairstyle what 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.280
 that what life here condemns is 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.870
 when the as the pastor said now 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.060
 when you want to guide the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 external appearance is ill of vanity 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.710
 and says yes no the intern anywhere 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 and be a skill that does not comb that looks 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.930
 dressed or that did not adorn what he says 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.060
 is that it is not extreme, I do believe that 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.980
 those who say that it is forbidden are 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.209
 wrong 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.580
 ok it's okay I do think it's the text you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.379
 conviction now does not also speak of the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.720
 pants women can not be 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.549
 put pants 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.540
 only dressed and much less in the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.340
 pulpit 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.470
 and of course men do not give 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.319
 beaten, but it is bad 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 interpretation of autogas woman exports 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.250
 that is put on women's pants not 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.190
 you can trousers and homs but the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.590
 bible does not speak of pants in any 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.170
 moment speaks of male dress 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.049
 and the woman's dress does not speak of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.230
 I want as how the dresses are from the 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.379
 women and men legs 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.340
 in our culture in our culture is 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:00.609
 so now also the root of what is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.099
 pedía had a cultural foundation 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.140
 also and there were many situations that 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.790
 they were around those cultures by 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.890
 which came the demand that the woman 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.900
 not seen the man's clothing and the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.940
 man is therefore equally careful 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.609
 in that sense but the Bible never used 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.410
 the term pants like some what 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.139
 have stereotyped so in 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.780
 West 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.090
 others we make the man normally 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.580
 says pants but if we go not very 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.949
 far to the same europe we are going to 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.080
 find countries where culturally the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.030
 man wears skirts or petticoats 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.319
 then you should tell the woman 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.210
 in those countries 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.449
 Wear pants because the man wears the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.449
 petticoat
