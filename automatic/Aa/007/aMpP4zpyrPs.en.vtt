00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.920 
great subject here first we want to do
look<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:26.910> bleeding<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.840> to

flush<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.350> wound<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.849> times<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
flush the wound out and a lot of times I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.720 
flush the wound out and a lot of times I
hear<00:00:30.570> Pat<00:00:31.260> under<00:00:31.470> say<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.680> put<00:00:31.980> peroxide<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.580> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
hear Pat under say I put peroxide on it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
hear Pat under say I put peroxide on it
and<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.629> try<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> avoid<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.260> because

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and we try to avoid that because

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380 
and we try to avoid that because
peroxide<00:00:35.160> connection<00:00:35.610> kill<00:00:35.820> healthy<00:00:36.150> tissue

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
peroxide connection kill healthy tissue

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
peroxide connection kill healthy tissue
so<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.019> not<00:00:37.290> flush<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:37.949> with

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so we want to not flush them out with

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
so we want to not flush them out with
peroxide<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.730> stay<00:00:39.030> away<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
peroxide so stay away from that if you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
peroxide so stay away from that if you
can<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.769> we<00:00:40.860> recommend<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.400> using<00:00:41.580> sterile

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can what we recommend is using sterile

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
can what we recommend is using sterile
saline<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.280> physiologic

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
saline which is you know physiologic

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
saline which is you know physiologic
saline<00:00:44.579> mean<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.980> same<00:00:47.219> as

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
saline mean it's the same the same as

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
saline mean it's the same the same as
the<00:00:47.879> body<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> destroy

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the body so it's not going to destroy

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.150 
the body so it's not going to destroy
cells<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.969> we<00:00:50.969> want<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.160> just

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
cells and we want to use this so just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.439 
cells and we want to use this so just
normal<00:00:53.489> saline<00:00:53.760> solution<00:00:54.120> point<00:00:54.329> nine

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
normal saline solution point nine

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.319 
normal saline solution point nine
percent<00:00:54.480> typically<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:55.800> betadine

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
percent typically and then betadine

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
percent typically and then betadine
included<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.449> betadine<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
included some betadine in here and you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
included some betadine in here and you
know<00:00:59.309> using<00:00:59.610> straight<00:00:59.850> betadine<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.449> also

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
know using straight betadine can also

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
know using straight betadine can also
damage<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.440> tissue<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
damage the tissue but what we do is we

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
damage the tissue but what we do is we
actually<00:01:03.329> mix<00:01:03.750> mix<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.410> two<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
actually mix mix the two we take just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
actually mix mix the two we take just
enough<00:01:05.640> betadine<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.930> bottle<00:01:07.259> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
enough betadine out of this bottle and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
enough betadine out of this bottle and
put<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> sterile<00:01:08.729> saline<00:01:08.880> bottle<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
put it in a sterile saline bottle and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.540 
put it in a sterile saline bottle and
one<00:01:10.350> make<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> sterile<00:01:10.860> saline<00:01:11.039> about<00:01:11.399> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
one make a sterile saline about the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.219 
one make a sterile saline about the
color<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.910> tea<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.509> that's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
color of tea so that's kind of the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.449 
color of tea so that's kind of the
guidelines<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> most

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
guidelines and that that's the most

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.730 
guidelines and that that's the most
effective<00:01:15.170> antiseptic<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.349> wound<00:01:16.470> treatment

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
effective antiseptic and wound treatment

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
effective antiseptic and wound treatment
so<00:01:17.479> yeah<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:20.550> once<00:01:20.729> you've<00:01:20.849> done<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.450> want

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
so yeah so once you've done that we want

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
so yeah so once you've done that we want
to<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.890> liquid<00:01:23.789> that<00:01:23.849> you<00:01:23.940> created<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to use the liquid that you created to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230 
to use the liquid that you created to
flush<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.929> wound<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.149> we're<00:01:27.149> going

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
flush the wound out with so we're going

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
flush the wound out with so we're going
to<00:01:27.300> flush<00:01:27.509> smooth<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> syringe<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to flush smooth with a syringe and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.680 
to flush smooth with a syringe and
what's<00:01:29.640> helpful<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.209> you<00:01:30.300> actually<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
what's helpful is if you actually have a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.999 
what's helpful is if you actually have a
needle<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.349> syringe<00:01:31.530> break<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
needle to go on the syringe break in

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.380 
needle to go on the syringe break in
this<00:01:32.099> route<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> needle<00:01:32.819> off<00:01:32.940> at<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.209> hub

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
this route the needle off at the hub

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.419 
this route the needle off at the hub
that<00:01:34.080> will<00:01:34.259> increase<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> pressure<00:01:34.979> what

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
that will increase the pressure what

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.520 
that will increase the pressure what
you're<00:01:35.580> trying<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:35.880> flush<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.569> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you're trying to flush out because the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.809 
you're trying to flush out because the
pressure<00:01:37.709> is<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.190> flushes<00:01:38.700> all

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
pressure is what actually flushes all

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.580 
pressure is what actually flushes all
the<00:01:38.940> bacteria<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.750> debris<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the bacteria and the debris out of the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
the bacteria and the debris out of the
wound<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.099> we're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> then

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
wound so we're going to do that and then

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
wound so we're going to do that and then
we're<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.289> flush<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.250> know

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we're just going to flush it you know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the material out and we'll feel a bit of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.680 
the material out and we'll feel a bit of
pressure<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> needle<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> end<00:01:54.569> of

pressure you so the needle on the end of

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.540 
pressure you so the needle on the end of
that<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.050> firstly<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.920> wound<00:01:56.039> is<00:01:56.130> important

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
that so firstly the wound is important

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.550 
that so firstly the wound is important
so<00:01:56.670> after<00:01:57.569> you<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> wound<00:01:57.989> flushed<00:01:58.349> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so after you get the wound flushed and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.960 
so after you get the wound flushed and
cleaned<00:01:59.270> next<00:02:00.270> thing<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.369> apply<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
cleaned next thing to do is you apply a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.180 
cleaned next thing to do is you apply a
topical<00:02:03.420> antibiotic<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.289> is<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
topical antibiotic this is a this is

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.410 
topical antibiotic this is a this is
actually<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:05.819> if<00:02:05.910> using<00:02:06.209> dairy

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
actually that about if using dairy

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.089 
actually that about if using dairy
cattle<00:02:06.660> but<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.929> find<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> useful<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.739> use<00:02:07.860> in

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
cattle but I find it useful for use in

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.040 
cattle but I find it useful for use in
you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.789> these<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> applications

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you know these kind of applications

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
you know these kind of applications
because<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.440> something<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.920> pack<00:02:11.459> with

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
because it's something you can pack with

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.770 
because it's something you can pack with
you<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.090> nothing<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.599> for

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you and there's nothing here for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
you and there's nothing here for
multiple<00:02:13.110> uses<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
multiple uses and this is just a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.520 
multiple uses and this is just a
cephalosporin<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.840> use<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.319> kind<00:02:16.500> of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
cephalosporin that we use it's kind of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400 
cephalosporin that we use it's kind of
neosporin<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.810> take<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.320> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
neosporin and you just take it and you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.920 
neosporin and you just take it and you
can

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
can

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.110 
can
to<00:02:20.049> fuse<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.409> wound<00:02:20.760> topically<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.939> then

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
to fuse the wound topically and then

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.030 
to fuse the wound topically and then
that<00:02:22.329> gives<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.230> an<00:02:23.290> added<00:02:23.409> layer<00:02:23.980> of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that gives you an added layer of

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.580 
that gives you an added layer of
protection<00:02:24.159> for<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:25.599> your<00:02:25.719> helping<00:02:26.230> prevent

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
bacterial infection with that being said

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.899 
bacterial infection with that being said
animals<00:02:29.769> should<00:02:29.859> also<00:02:30.010> be<00:02:30.219> put<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.459> systemic

having<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.510> bandage<00:03:14.290> slip<00:03:14.500> off<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.510> first

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
having a bandage slip off so the first

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.559 
having a bandage slip off so the first
thing<00:03:16.870> we're<00:03:17.019> going<00:03:17.139> to<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.620> apply<00:03:17.889> is

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
thing we're going to going to apply is

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.530 
thing we're going to going to apply is
Kimberly<00:03:20.669> see<00:03:21.669> if<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:21.849> can<00:03:22.000> get<00:03:22.150> me<00:03:22.209> blade<00:03:22.389> down

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
Kimberly see if we can get me blade down

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.800 
Kimberly see if we can get me blade down
so<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.439> a<00:03:23.469> nonstick<00:03:24.220> bandage<00:03:24.669> and<00:03:24.849> it's

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
so this is a nonstick bandage and it's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.509 
so this is a nonstick bandage and it's
called<00:03:26.049> tough<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.409> pad<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.979> a<00:03:27.069> band-aid

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
called tough a pad just like a band-aid

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.839 
called tough a pad just like a band-aid
so<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:29.319> know<00:03:29.409> first<00:03:29.590> put<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:29.979> go<00:03:30.340> first<00:03:30.760> of

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
so you know first put that go first of

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.649 
so you know first put that go first of
all<00:03:30.879> I<00:03:30.940> guess<00:03:31.060> we're<00:03:31.180> going<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.359> start<00:03:31.540> by

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
all I guess we're going to start by

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.229 
all I guess we're going to start by
creating<00:03:32.650> our<00:03:32.889> stirrups<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.549> first<00:03:33.790> thing<00:03:34.000> so

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
creating our stirrups the first thing so

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.509 
creating our stirrups the first thing so
we'll<00:03:34.599> do<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.750> this<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.439> let's<00:03:36.159> see<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
we'll do that this is let's see this is

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.860 
we'll do that this is let's see this is
going<00:03:36.669> to<00:03:36.760> create<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.299> help<00:03:37.389> prevent<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
going to create and help prevent the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.140 
going to create and help prevent the
advantage<00:03:38.439> from<00:03:38.579> sliding<00:03:39.579> down<00:03:39.699> after<00:03:40.090> we

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
advantage from sliding down after we

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.670 
advantage from sliding down after we
finish<00:03:40.449> up<00:03:40.599> here<00:03:40.659> so<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.169> put<00:03:41.319> those<00:03:41.439> on

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
finish up here so you put those on

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.210 
finish up here so you put those on
either<00:03:42.370> side<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.000> wound<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.099> then<00:03:45.099> we'll

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
either side of the wound and then we'll

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.399 
either side of the wound and then we'll
just<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:46.329> can<00:03:46.510> just<00:03:46.540> connect<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.019> ends<00:03:47.260> here

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
just you can just connect the ends here

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.099 
just you can just connect the ends here
so<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.799> we<00:03:47.889> don't<00:03:48.040> stick<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.459> each<00:03:48.519> other

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
so that we don't stick to each other

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.280 
so that we don't stick to each other
keep<00:03:50.109> out<00:03:50.290> for<00:03:50.439> later<00:03:50.530> use<00:03:50.799> so<00:03:52.109> first<00:03:53.109> thing

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
keep out for later use so first thing

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.649 
keep out for later use so first thing
we're<00:03:54.159> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.340> put<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.609> nonstick<00:03:55.090> tough<00:03:55.540> a

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
we're going to put the nonstick tough a

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.699 
we're going to put the nonstick tough a
pad<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.139> moon<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.790> then<00:03:58.229> you<00:03:59.229> know<00:03:59.349> next

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
pad on the moon and then you know next

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.289 
pad on the moon and then you know next
layer<00:04:00.159> that<00:04:00.280> goes<00:04:00.430> over<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:00.669> is<00:04:00.790> cotton<00:04:01.030> and

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
layer that goes over that is cotton and

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.509 
layer that goes over that is cotton and
that's<00:04:01.419> going<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.629> help<00:04:01.780> absorb<00:04:01.959> any<00:04:02.519> wound

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
that's going to help absorb any wound

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.520 
that's going to help absorb any wound
discharge<00:04:03.970> which<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.299> blood<00:04:04.569> or<00:04:04.810> drainage<00:04:05.409> or

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
discharge which is blood or drainage or

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.259 
discharge which is blood or drainage or
anything<00:04:05.680> other<00:04:06.639> kinds<00:04:06.909> of<00:04:06.970> drains<00:04:07.150> like

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
anything other kinds of drains like

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.330 
anything other kinds of drains like
serum<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.079> wrap<00:04:08.319> that<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.769> this

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
serum so you can wrap that and this

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.589 
serum so you can wrap that and this
cotton<00:04:09.699> layer<00:04:09.849> you<00:04:10.060> know<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.239> know<00:04:10.419> it's

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
cotton layer you know you know it's

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.300 
cotton layer you know you know it's
always<00:04:10.780> important<00:04:11.229> not<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.379> put<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> bandage<00:04:12.159> on

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
always important not to put a bandage on

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.640 
always important not to put a bandage on
too<00:04:12.549> tight<00:04:12.819> and<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.299> way<00:04:13.419> you<00:04:13.479> tell<00:04:14.259> if<00:04:14.530> you

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
too tight and the way you tell if you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.749 
too tight and the way you tell if you
have<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.949> too<00:04:15.069> tight<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.549> want<00:04:15.729> to

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
have it too tight is you want to

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.029 
have it too tight is you want to
hopefully<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:17.320> able<00:04:17.409> to<00:04:17.560> leave<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> toes

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
hopefully be able to leave the toes

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.099 
hopefully be able to leave the toes
exposed<00:04:18.609> so<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.419> can<00:04:19.539> see<00:04:19.690> if<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:19.930> toes

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
exposed so you can see if this toes

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.149 
exposed so you can see if this toes
start<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.470> swell<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.799> means<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:21.039> have<00:04:21.130> your

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
start to swell that means you have your

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.620 
start to swell that means you have your
bandage<00:04:21.459> on<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.729> tightening<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.180> redo<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.509> so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
bandage on to tightening to redo it so

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.659 
bandage on to tightening to redo it so
with<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.560> cotton<00:04:23.860> layer<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.099> actually<00:04:24.400> can't

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
with the cotton layer you actually can't

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.070 
with the cotton layer you actually can't
to<00:04:24.820> get<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.030> too<00:04:25.150> tight<00:04:25.360> because<00:04:25.599> if<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
to get it too tight because if you do it

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.420 
to get it too tight because if you do it
just<00:04:26.169> breaks<00:04:26.470> as<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.889> see<00:04:27.039> that<00:04:27.190> so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
just breaks as you can see that so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.409 
just breaks as you can see that so
that's<00:04:28.120> easy<00:04:28.539> enough<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:30.210> next<00:04:31.210> layer<00:04:31.389> on

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
that's easy enough there next layer on

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.940 
that's easy enough there next layer on
the<00:04:31.570> top<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.960> cotton<00:04:32.349> is<00:04:32.469> using

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
the top of the cotton is using

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.560 
the top of the cotton is using
the<00:04:33.070> gauze<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.510> just<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:36.270> God's<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.480> this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
the gauze it's just just God's and this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.910 
the gauze it's just just God's and this
you<00:04:37.720> can<00:04:37.960> actually<00:04:38.140> get<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.440> tight<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:38.860> you

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
you can actually get to tight so you

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.710 
you can actually get to tight so you
want<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.100> be<00:04:39.160> careful<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:40.090> just<00:04:40.180> lay<00:04:40.420> it<00:04:40.570> on

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
want to be careful and just lay it on

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.940 
want to be careful and just lay it on
there<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.020> know<00:04:41.110> there's<00:04:41.260> no<00:04:41.410> reason<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.770> pull

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
there you know there's no reason to pull

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.040 
there you know there's no reason to pull
it<00:04:42.010> too<00:04:42.130> tight<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.790> overlap<00:04:43.330> by<00:04:43.510> about<00:04:43.690> 50%

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
it too tight and overlap by about 50%

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.480 
it too tight and overlap by about 50%
each<00:04:44.380> time<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.890> go<00:04:45.010> up<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.280> down<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
each time and just go up and down the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.970 
each time and just go up and down the
wound<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:46.600> know<00:04:46.720> more<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.530> better<00:04:47.710> because

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
wound you know more is better because
