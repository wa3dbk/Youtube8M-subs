progress nice new resonator cover and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.209 
progress nice new resonator cover and
comb<00:00:32.489> we've<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:33.329> talking<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> lot<00:00:34.050> about

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
comb we've been talking a lot about

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
comb we've been talking a lot about
resonators<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> forum<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.390> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
resonators on the forum so I just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.150 
resonators on the forum so I just
thought<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.590> take<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.070> show<00:00:38.370> everybody

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
thought I would take and show everybody

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
thought I would take and show everybody
kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> resonator<00:00:42.480> works<00:00:42.809> we've<00:00:43.110> been

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
kind of how a resonator works we've been

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
kind of how a resonator works we've been
talking<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.620> tuna<00:00:44.219> cans<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.000> kinds<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
talking about tuna cans and all kinds of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
talking about tuna cans and all kinds of
stuff<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> that's<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.039> fine<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
stuff and that's all fine and well

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
stuff and that's all fine and well
because<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> resonator<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.260> anything

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because a resonator can be anything

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.560 
because a resonator can be anything
anything<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.579> resonate<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.329> could<00:00:51.449> be

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
anything that will resonate it could be

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.350 
anything that will resonate it could be
the<00:00:51.690> wood<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.079> top<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> box<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.210> all

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the wood on top of the box but with all

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
the wood on top of the box but with all
the<00:00:54.510> talk<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> cones<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.760> resonators<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the talk of cones and resonators I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.420 
the talk of cones and resonators I
thought<00:00:57.059> I'd<00:00:57.210> show<00:00:57.449> everybody<00:00:58.430> especially

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
thought I'd show everybody especially

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.180 
thought I'd show everybody especially
some<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> newbies<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> aren't<00:01:01.980> quite

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
some of the newbies that aren't quite

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
some of the newbies that aren't quite
sure<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.699> mechanics<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.890> resonator<00:01:04.890> our

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sure the mechanics of resonator our

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.719 
sure the mechanics of resonator our
resonator<00:01:05.880> needs<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:07.100> rim<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.340> set<00:01:08.549> on

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
resonator needs a rim to set on

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.020 
resonator needs a rim to set on
something<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> rest<00:01:09.869> against<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> vibrate

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
something to rest against to vibrate

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
something to rest against to vibrate
needs<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> sound<00:01:12.390> well<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> see

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
needs a sound well you can kind of see

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
needs a sound well you can kind of see
some<00:01:14.040> portholes<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
some portholes I got there and I kind of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
some portholes I got there and I kind of
put<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> shallower<00:01:17.009> box

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
put one in the back on a shallower box

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.359 
put one in the back on a shallower box
like<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> sound<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> out

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
like this one so the sound can get out

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
like this one so the sound can get out
your<00:01:21.259> resonator<00:01:22.259> cone<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> six<00:01:23.280> inch

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
your resonator cone this is a six inch

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.539 
your resonator cone this is a six inch
spun<00:01:24.150> aluminum<00:01:24.360> cone<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.189> makes<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
spun aluminum cone now what makes a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
spun aluminum cone now what makes a
resonator<00:01:27.000> work<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.579> looks

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
resonator work if you look at that looks

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
resonator work if you look at that looks
just<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> speaker<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.200> your

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just about like a speaker for your

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740 
just about like a speaker for your
stereo<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.610> functions<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.540> like

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
stereo and it functions really just like

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.990 
stereo and it functions really just like
one<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.229> rather<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> magnet<00:01:35.850> behind

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
one but rather than have a magnet behind

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.050 
one but rather than have a magnet behind
here<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> wires<00:01:37.350> attached<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.280> stereo

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
here and wires attached to the stereo

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
here and wires attached to the stereo
and<00:01:39.119> electronics<00:01:39.900> pushing<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.470> pulling<00:01:40.680> that

speaker<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.909> rely<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.210> string<00:01:42.689> pressure

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
speaker you rely on string pressure

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
speaker you rely on string pressure
well<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> cone<00:01:44.430> sets<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> cloud<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
well the cone sets down in the cloud the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
well the cone sets down in the cloud the
well<00:01:46.430> against<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> ring<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.939> showed<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
well against that ring I showed you and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
well against that ring I showed you and
then<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.040> call<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.280> biscuit

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then it has what they call a biscuit

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
then it has what they call a biscuit
that<00:01:51.030> goes<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.780> top<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.619> your
