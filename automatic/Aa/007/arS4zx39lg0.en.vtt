00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
the idea I'm gonna do this side and I'll

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.780 
the idea I'm gonna do this side and I'll

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
so I've almost finished this side I just

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.130 
so I've almost finished this side I just
felt<00:05:47.580> like<00:05:47.610> a<00:05:47.700> few<00:05:47.910> more<00:05:48.030> pieces<00:05:48.180> are<00:05:48.450> here<00:05:48.660> so

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
felt like a few more pieces are here so

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.960 
felt like a few more pieces are here so
I'm<00:05:49.380> just<00:05:49.560> gonna<00:05:49.650> show<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:49.980> how<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.460> do<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.820> one

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
I'm just gonna show you how to do it one

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.700 
I'm just gonna show you how to do it one
more<00:05:51.000> time<00:05:51.150> so<00:05:51.390> you<00:05:51.720> get<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.080> whole<00:05:52.290> idea

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
more time so you get the whole idea

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.530 
more time so you get the whole idea
because<00:05:53.670> this<00:05:53.760> is<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.000> other<00:05:54.150> side<00:05:54.240> of<00:05:54.480> my

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
because this is the other side of my

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.610 
because this is the other side of my
head<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.900> it<00:05:54.960> might<00:05:55.050> be<00:05:55.170> a<00:05:55.200> little<00:05:55.350> different

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
head so it might be a little different

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.140 
head so it might be a little different
so<00:05:55.890> I'll<00:05:56.160> start<00:05:56.400> with<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.610> one<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:56.940> like<00:05:57.000> I

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.730 

and<00:07:08.420> while<00:07:08.600> I'm<00:07:08.720> doing<00:07:08.960> all<00:07:09.110> this<00:07:09.260> flipping

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
and while I'm doing all this flipping

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.970 
and while I'm doing all this flipping
I'm<00:07:09.920> gonna<00:07:10.130> find<00:07:10.460> where<00:07:11.240> I<00:07:11.300> like<00:07:11.720> my<00:07:11.930> part<00:07:12.230> so<00:07:12.620> I

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:12.980 
I'm gonna find where I like my part so I

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.250 
I'm gonna find where I like my part so I
flipped<00:07:13.220> it<00:07:13.340> over<00:07:13.580> like<00:07:13.880> this<00:07:14.060> and<00:07:14.450> I<00:07:15.020> like<00:07:15.170> the

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
flipped it over like this and I like the

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.900 
flipped it over like this and I like the
way<00:07:15.350> this<00:07:15.470> looks<00:07:15.530> so<00:07:16.160> then<00:07:16.490> I'll<00:07:16.580> leave<00:07:16.790> it

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
way this looks so then I'll leave it

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.100 
way this looks so then I'll leave it
right<00:07:16.940> there<00:07:17.240> and<00:07:17.450> I'll<00:07:17.570> let<00:07:17.750> it<00:07:17.780> just<00:07:17.960> fall

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
right there and I'll let it just fall

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.340 
right there and I'll let it just fall
however<00:07:18.620> it<00:07:18.920> wants<00:07:19.190> to<00:07:19.400> and<00:07:19.790> I<00:07:20.630> like<00:07:20.870> Dept<00:07:21.290> it

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
however it wants to and I like Dept it

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.990 
however it wants to and I like Dept it
on<00:07:21.440> this<00:07:21.530> side<00:07:21.710> but<00:07:21.950> sometimes<00:07:22.340> I<00:07:22.670> switch<00:07:22.850> it

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
on this side but sometimes I switch it

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.090 
on this side but sometimes I switch it
up<00:07:23.090> so<00:07:23.150> it<00:07:23.390> doesn't<00:07:23.630> really<00:07:23.690> matter<00:07:23.990> but<00:07:24.740> see

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100 
up so it doesn't really matter but see

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.620 
up so it doesn't really matter but see
