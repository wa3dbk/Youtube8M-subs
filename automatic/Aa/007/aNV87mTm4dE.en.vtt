 pc configuration that a lot on my 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.330
 pc that train a bit 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.430
 suffer a little bit the resolutions 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.840
 of screen would not like but it's 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.610
 simple ones that are very simple to 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.200

 super simple super easy to 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.160
 job and there we can already spent daniel 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.720
 bryan 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.000
 already stunning and red shirts 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.100
 the t-shirt is directly installed in 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
 the mode so no need after going back 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.729
 create a character of the year 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 anne to integrate him this new 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.030
 tee-shirt it's already included in 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.799
 it's great to 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.590
 is and right now and the rendering is 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.520
 super goal of happy is super awesome 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.530
 it allows us to make a little one 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 little nod to daniel bryan who who 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.700
 handed the press before his career a 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.290
 little question about recent 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.390
 wounds go and we discover suddenly 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 the mode of home that has not been no 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.540
 more up to date at the game level the entries 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.300
 but that you can have freedom 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.990
 to do it there we have the choice is so to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.380
 from this beginning of the season 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.210
 fourteen 2015 to write my bac the beard 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.490
 I had cut well with small 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 press it's super well done I'm 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.390
 really accomplices surprised at the speed 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.520
 to which things have evolved but 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.289
 it's really great fun and we have a 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.479
 excellent home fashion at level 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.549
 to decorate a little more 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.470
 ordinary day byrne also realized a 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.020
 dinard mode bronze by cons mode 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.030
 life many 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 the welcome that his haircut 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 will be free after you to change so 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.369
 therefore felt will try to recreate so 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.060
 suddenly a bronze president who is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.459
 odious 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 in short, it will have to be updated 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.940
 I guess we'll be able soon 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.470
 have the direct mobilization on the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.849
 characters from the game stuffed with their outfit 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.560
 it will be another step forward 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.560
 extra but already nothing 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 it's great owl 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.450
 go it's gone match between dell and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 brian chase that the computer will control 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.390
 will reap if he will get to see 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.920
 a little bit what gives and ja ja 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.790
 is at the difficult level pretend is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.280
 not a level the people I had 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.680
 so let the computer level 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.810
 difficult 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.250
 we still see for Bessan the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.689
 resolution of the images for each of the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.000
 people and canes a little bit less 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.109
 powerful like mine that allows 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.019
 still to have beyond the 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.340
 fluidity in the movements of the games 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.120
 hyper excellence it will always be more 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.650
 own 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.560
 if you are on graphics cards 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 geforce a little over 700 you 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.769
 will always have a good graphic rendering 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.799
 I remain much higher as I ai 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.139
 said I'm on 635 and that's not it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.849
 it's not great but it's not that so 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.349
 you will see the modes are really 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.270
 super simple install I talked about it all 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.430
 on time 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's just the packard point files 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.270
 in place and linking descriptive so 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.530
 obliged to come to miss the three 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.000
 modes to download you can 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.130
 find on the forum of smac tons 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.110

 sing the love of bringing up to date 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.230

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.290
 in English but you are going to have 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.450
 a lot of trouble to understand that for 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.830
 to know where the settlers are settling 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.110

 shane williams who returns with his 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.380

 for me to discover a little bit 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.180
 bryant in the game still suffers on 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.290
 moment of my career so I am 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.540
 rarely play with real 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.130
