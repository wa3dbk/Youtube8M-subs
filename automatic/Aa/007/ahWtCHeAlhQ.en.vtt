00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 this new video where we will see e 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 we will do a little gameplay of the new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 beat 4 played at three of the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.369
 electronic art of the IAEA and we already see 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.670
 absurd beginning that one arrives in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 helicopter in this part there are 64 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 the players 32 against 32 in fact the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.950
 gameplay has been played on its own 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.760
 conference and there were 64 computers or 64 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.770
 players each provided bombs 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 keyboard or controller 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 meanwhile we see this written this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 action he had written to command 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.629
 online and then they were models you will already know 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.590
 but we'll see later 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.590
 I could commander 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.010
 and it was also said that on consoles 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.980
 new generation on xbox one e 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.050
 these co 4 will be possible to arrive at 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.369
 A maximum of 64 players in 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.840
 lobby so it will no longer be like xbox e 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.390
 playstation 3 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.509
 it reaches a maximum of 32 but of 64 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.610
 they have also increased a lot 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.860
 the dynamism of the map or even 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.580
 destructibility without it 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.590
 mode and capture the flag and oh well 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.740
 there are about real flag you will know no a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.960
 affair even if today I am always 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 thoroughly played an unknown aspect yes 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.130
 lose we talk about internships and a personal one 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.580
 darkens the tank fires a shot ago 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.979
 collapse the outgoing greeting to do 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.670
 as soon as the tank is done he pulls 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.009
 a grenade to the mainstay of the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
 the road drops the road the carnet 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:01.080
 amateurs but in stuck and its micro 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 squares c4 and blows up no one else 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 and then, as you can see, they also travel a little 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.660
 the team then by pure indication 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.430
 his team sees so now he has done the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.240
 hand and indicates that low and must 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.360
 shoot that goal 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.690
 another thing they added as 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 we will see now they added why me 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.890
 apparently there were no ships before 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 in fact we see here he arrives finds himself 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.590
 located in front of a ship called 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.570
 then, after removing the ascension motions, I'm jumping 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.260
 a ship that you can already have of yourself 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.930
 missile attention to raise part time 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.930
 mind and vote for it then there are 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.080
 6 shape 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.960
 but these maps are enormous absurd 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.180
 the helicopter arrives and saying this 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.530
 although no way out 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 meanwhile look at the destructibility 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.380
 maybe try the textures and multiplayer 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.040
 they lose a bit because the engine understood 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.450
 it must process more things as there are 64 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.730
 player if I could see a little 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.710
 mister 40 would have been absurd 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.370
 even they are so great 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.270
 maps you lire force on buildings 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.590
 through an elevator there is a 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.090
 pasta 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.600
 anyway I was telling myself I always have 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.720
 played at the battlefield ho never 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.750
 played separately on 1 and 2 and 3 have 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 already played and I have to say this 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.440
 butterfield 4 surprised me enough 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.780
 a lot with the graphic sla has always been 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.700
 even so in battlefield 3 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160
 but to the instructive of the maps is one 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.640
 absurd thing 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.750
 therefore certain what is our there seems 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.580
 meanwhile watch this scene he hardy 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.790
 the helicopter arrives in his friend pulls 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.310
 out the rocket launcher and drop it but 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.800
 here comes the point of the commander on 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.940
 commander and is a part of one player 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.669
 of 64 well there is one for each team 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.019
 theoretically and commands and you see that 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.000
 look what present that hand and vi 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.979
 it was a command and can be connected 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.830
 via a tablet a to the servers of 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.290
 beat us 4 on pc and we are the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.660
 player apart from the whole vision 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.919
 the map being able to give being able to give 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.540
 tactical orders allam to the team or 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.260
 using the artillery you saw 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.290
 which launched a tome from the dal 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.940
 door aircraft I think they are worn 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.800
 inside 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.539
 and okay while I was ahead deadly 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.069
 they shoot him but it's okay if it means 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.190
 that this beat surprised me a lot 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:02.699
 I totally depend on tasks instead 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.479
 goss or beat you 4 while we talk 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.569
 here he is thrown from the building pulls 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.400
 outside the parachute and as soon as you turn around 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.379
 see something you have never seen 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.530
 they saw this thing 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.530
 so 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 look collapses a whole building which 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.080
 how absurd is a disinterest 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:38.260
 which we see various gameplay parties 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.820
 and nothing the video is finished true 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.160
 talk 4 finish the knife i hope vi 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.170
 both liked it and nothing we see it at 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.170
 next video casola
