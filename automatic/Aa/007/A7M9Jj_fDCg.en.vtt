00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the next application I already wanted 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.319
 demonstrate from the patio of my house but 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.420
 It was so much inspiration that a few days 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.370
 friends youtube subscribers the day of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 today I want to show you the amazing 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.570
 application to and for the aps and explain 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.390
 what does it work for we go for a logo and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.750
 let's start with the video exactly as 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 we published yesterday in Martian home.com 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.710
 instagram and facebook have launched a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.140
 new application called high pearl and the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.640
 truth is that this application is so 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 surprising that do not hesitate to show 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.730
 only bad of this application I have to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 mention what is not yet 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 available for androids that is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.040
 available we are going to tell you we are going to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.809
 leave the link in the description and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.719
 also in an article will be the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
 link about this same application what 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.610
 What this application does is that it creates 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 time lives that are simply 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.789
 awesome remember how much I 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.989
 liked the timelapse that comes with year is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.000
 86 but this one is incomparable and I'm going to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 explain why the hardest thing when 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.829
 you're recording timelapse is the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 movements because like the camera more 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.300
 fast with a little movement you're going to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 give as I know 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220
 to see that you move too much and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.000
 exactly that is where this application 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.470
 it stands out has a stabilization 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 too good indeed the videos do not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.510
 They have a masterly quality, they lack 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 little in quality but due to the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.280
 stabilization that has and since 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
 We are recording video in timelapse is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.330
 too impressive many are going to 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.940
 which ask for differences 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.220
 exists between this application and the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.200
 timelapse that will come by default in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.370
 ios 8 to which I already made a video 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.130
 I'm going to leave here we take so that what 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.930
 see and it's too different guys the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.280
 ios 8 timelapse is too much 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.120
 illuminated I think that now I see that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.220
 so bad is the timelapse of ios 8 is 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.900
 too limited for example you can 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 record as I explained in the video of 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.020
 time lapse of ios 8 you can record 66 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 hours or 3 hours 30 minutes any 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.570
 time that you serious is going to give you in 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640
 37 seconds with a short explanation of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.100
 how does the hyper lapse work? 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 understand more the differences that exist 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.900
 between the hyper the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 ios 8 although the application is created by 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.770
 instagram and facebook you do not need to have 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.070
 said accounts to enter you 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.750
 you just open it and it 's totally ready 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.490
 free and I'll leave the link as 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
 I already told you down here since you enter 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.930
 the application is super simple to be 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.150
 the first button to start recording and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.670
 you can already record you can record in mode 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.320
 horizontal and vertical while recording you 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.990
 is showing the real time that is being 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.590
 recording and it tells you how much time it is going to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 last once you have advanced six 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.120
 times it's like the middle now 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.130
 When you stop recording, it shows you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.050
 as a revised as a preview of what 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180
 that you just recorded and there you what 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.490
 you can see and there exactly exactly there is 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.110
 where you can change the speed 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.030
 you have speed 1 which is the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.330
 speed 0 has speed 2 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.710
 speed 4 then speed 6 jumps 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.070
 that is the speed that shows you 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.950
 when you're recording speed 8 10 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.750
 and the ultra-fast speed that is the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.270
 speed 12 guys you can see 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.610
 there what those videos look like and I was 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.810
 recording all these videos simply 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.250
 with the hand ok 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 I did not have any extra device to 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.050
 stabilize the device above you have 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.310
 the accept and save ok button accept 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.470
 and publish or cancel or edit ok 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.050
 although you can not see but title cancels you 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.700
 gives the option to edit not only 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.500
 erase you can save it notice that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.630
 when one is watching the video one 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.450
 you can press the screen and see the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.239
 video without the stabilization effect and 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.790
 there you realize how horrible you are 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.470
 you were recording that and that's where 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.090
 you are really more surprised 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.549
 application is super simple to use no longer 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.959
 I have more adjustments than mentioning them 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.150
 now you can only publish in 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.549
 instagram or on facebook is a tough 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.049
 blow to those we love most bain 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.650
 amazing of this application guys 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.910
 I have to repeat is its stabilization 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.530
 remember these videos all the videos 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.140
 what I'm showing here I recorded it without 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.239
 no other device to stabilize 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.010
 the video and there you will realize 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.750
 of the difference install this 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.639
 application tell me what do you think 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.260
 of the application if you liked it 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.240
 If there was another, they can also 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.039
 say down here if there is a 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.180
 better than you recommend me also 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.610
 I can leave it down here in the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.889
 comments but this is one of my 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.289
 already favorite applications tell me that 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.610
 you think about the video too and they were 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.590
 One little hand up if the video liked it 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.389
 subscribe so that youtube says every 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.639
 Once you see a new video this has been 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.090
 everything for today Martian phone if this
