we'll<00:00:07.620> show<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.429> video<00:00:09.769> start

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
we'll show you how in this video start

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.440 
we'll show you how in this video start
by<00:00:10.889> cutting<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> cord<00:00:11.580> off<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.969> power<00:00:12.150> brick

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
by cutting the cord off the power brick

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
by cutting the cord off the power brick
then<00:00:12.990> cut<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> damaged<00:00:13.920> part<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.370> expose

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
then cut off the damaged part to expose

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
then cut off the damaged part to expose
fresh<00:00:15.089> wires

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
fresh wires

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.430 
fresh wires
then<00:00:17.550> cut<00:00:17.820> away<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> outer<00:00:18.360> sheathing<00:00:18.840> being

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
then cut away the outer sheathing being

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.650 
then cut away the outer sheathing being
careful<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.130> cut<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> inside<00:00:20.910> wires<00:00:21.240> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
careful not to cut the inside wires just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.920 
careful not to cut the inside wires just
take<00:00:22.349> your<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.980> slowly<00:00:23.220> cut<00:00:23.520> it<00:00:23.640> off

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
take your time and slowly cut it off

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
take your time and slowly cut it off
once<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> outer<00:00:26.130> insulation<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:27.029> removed

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
once the outer insulation is removed

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.420 
once the outer insulation is removed
you'll<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.260> inner<00:00:28.470> insulated<00:00:29.220> wire

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
you'll see an inner insulated wire

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.470 
you'll see an inner insulated wire
wrapped<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.150> uninsulated<00:00:30.750> wires<00:00:32.480> untwist

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
wrapped with uninsulated wires untwist

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.110 
wrapped with uninsulated wires untwist
and<00:00:33.690> unravel<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.620> uninsulated<00:00:35.220> wires<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and unravel the uninsulated wires to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.479 
and unravel the uninsulated wires to
separate<00:00:36.540> them<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.230> insulated<00:00:37.590> one

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.340 

if<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:41.329> were<00:00:41.450> really<00:00:41.719> careful<00:00:42.110> when<00:00:42.260> you

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
if you were really careful when you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.650 
if you were really careful when you
remove<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.860> outer<00:00:43.010> insulation<00:00:43.420> most<00:00:44.420> or<00:00:44.629> all

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
remove the outer insulation most or all

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.139 
remove the outer insulation most or all
of<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.320> wire<00:00:45.500> should<00:00:45.800> still<00:00:46.070> be<00:00:46.219> intact<00:00:46.550> but

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
of the wire should still be intact but

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.610 
of the wire should still be intact but
don't<00:00:47.360> worry<00:00:47.510> if<00:00:47.719> a<00:00:47.840> few<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.079> them<00:00:48.290> are<00:00:48.410> cut

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
don't worry if a few of them are cut

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.599 
don't worry if a few of them are cut
short<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.190> won't<00:00:49.550> affect<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.000> performance

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.939 

use<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.239> pair<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.570> wire<00:00:58.839> strippers<00:00:58.870> or<00:00:59.499> a<00:00:59.559> knife

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
use a pair of wire strippers or a knife

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.889 
use a pair of wire strippers or a knife
to<00:01:00.219> cut<00:01:00.249> off<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.789> insulation<00:01:01.390> on<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.570> white

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
to cut off the insulation on the white

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.109 
to cut off the insulation on the white
wire<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.469> expose<00:01:02.920> about<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.309> quarter<00:01:03.730> inch<00:01:03.940> of

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
wire to expose about a quarter inch of

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:11.630 
wire to expose about a quarter inch of
the<00:01:04.269> wire

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.929 

you

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.300 

with<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.630> insulation<00:01:20.049> removed<00:01:20.560> twist<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
with the insulation removed twist the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.070 
with the insulation removed twist the
metal<00:01:21.579> wires<00:01:21.789> together

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.620 

then<00:01:25.890> twist<00:01:26.160> all<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> bare-metal<00:01:27.030> strands

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
then twist all the bare-metal strands

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
then twist all the bare-metal strands
together<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.650> another<00:01:28.980> separate<00:01:29.460> wire

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.030 

twisting<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> strands<00:01:34.200> together<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.770> helps

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
twisting the strands together just helps

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
twisting the strands together just helps
to<00:01:35.070> hold<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.580> together<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:36.150> we'll<00:01:36.450> make

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
to hold it all together and we'll make

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.360 
to hold it all together and we'll make
it<00:01:36.630> easier<00:01:37.050> for<00:01:37.110> us<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> put<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> insulation

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
it easier for us to put the insulation

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.590 
it easier for us to put the insulation
on<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.210> step

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 

a<00:01:42.630> short<00:01:43.020> piece<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.470> small<00:01:43.770> heat<00:01:44.010> shrink

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
a short piece of small heat shrink

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
a short piece of small heat shrink
tubing<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.030> fit<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.479> over<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> wires

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
tubing that will fit just over the wires

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
tubing that will fit just over the wires
that<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.680> twist<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.880> we'll

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that you just twist it up then we'll

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
that you just twist it up then we'll
just<00:01:48.210> slide<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.720> over<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> top

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.080 

you<00:01:53.710> can<00:01:53.890> see<00:01:54.070> here<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.340> some<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.880> little

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you can see here that some of the little

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.029 
you can see here that some of the little
strands<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.659> wire<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.079> we<00:01:56.229> accidentally<00:01:56.710> cut

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
strands of wire that we accidentally cut

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.590 
strands of wire that we accidentally cut
are<00:01:57.250> making<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.729> little<00:01:57.909> bit<00:01:58.000> difficult<00:01:58.210> to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
are making it a little bit difficult to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.419 
are making it a little bit difficult to
slide<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:59.109> heat<00:01:59.350> shrink<00:01:59.679> tubing<00:02:00.039> over<00:02:00.310> the

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
slide that heat shrink tubing over the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.179 
slide that heat shrink tubing over the
top<00:02:00.640> again<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:02.229> not<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.409> big<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.740> deal<00:02:02.979> if

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
top again it's not that big a deal if

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.100 
top again it's not that big a deal if
you<00:02:03.280> cut<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> few<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:04.750> makes<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.049> a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
you cut a few and it just makes it a

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.809 
you cut a few and it just makes it a
little<00:02:05.259> bit<00:02:05.409> harder<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.280> definitely<00:02:06.490> can

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
little bit harder but it definitely can

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.270 
little bit harder but it definitely can
still<00:02:07.060> be<00:02:07.149> done

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
still be done

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.760 
still be done

wires in the Power Grip adapter we'll

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.649 
wires in the Power Grip adapter we'll
need<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.530> remove<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.829> old<00:03:05.129> wires<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
need to remove the old wires if you

rewire a power brick it might be worth
your<00:03:10.110> time<00:03:10.349> now<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.860> understand<00:03:11.370> how<00:03:11.519> we

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
your time now if you understand how we

your time now if you understand how we
remove<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.239> plug<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.780> first

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.960 

the<00:03:18.560> dremel<00:03:18.920> tool<00:03:19.070> cuts<00:03:19.400> through<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.730> plastic

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the dremel tool cuts through the plastic

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.240 
the dremel tool cuts through the plastic
easily<00:03:20.600> with<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> cut-off<00:03:21.080> wheel<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:22.100> we

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
easily with a cut-off wheel and then we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.650 
easily with a cut-off wheel and then we
just<00:03:22.400> pull<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:22.940> hard<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.330> pull<00:03:23.540> those

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
just pull really hard to pull those

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.650 
just pull really hard to pull those
wires<00:03:23.900> out

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.960 

it's<00:03:27.410> almost<00:03:27.680> ready<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.490> help<00:03:28.670> get<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's almost ready but to help get the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.160 
it's almost ready but to help get the
wires<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.390> there<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> little<00:03:29.720> better<00:03:29.900> we're

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
wires in there a little better we're

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.840 
wires in there a little better we're
going<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.320> clean<00:03:30.650> off<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:31.070> little<00:03:31.370> bit<00:03:31.490> more<00:03:31.700> of

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
going to clean off a little bit more of

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.570 
going to clean off a little bit more of
the<00:03:31.970> plastic<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.660> then<00:03:32.840> we'll<00:03:33.020> drill<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.380> out

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
the plastic and then we'll drill it out

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.340 
the plastic and then we'll drill it out
the<00:03:34.580> dremel<00:03:34.940> tool<00:03:35.090> again<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.600> really<00:03:35.930> easy<00:03:36.140> it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the dremel tool again is really easy it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.090 
the dremel tool again is really easy it
just<00:03:36.380> cuts<00:03:36.800> right<00:03:36.890> through<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.400> stuff<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
just cuts right through this stuff the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.680 
just cuts right through this stuff the
exact<00:03:43.460> size<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.000> drill<00:03:44.210> bit<00:03:44.390> isn't

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
exact size of the drill bit isn't

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.940 
exact size of the drill bit isn't
important<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:45.290> you'll<00:03:45.470> want<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.650> make<00:03:45.800> sure

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
important but you'll want to make sure

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.010 
important but you'll want to make sure
you<00:03:46.070> don't<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.460> over<00:03:46.730> about<00:03:46.930> 3/16<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.020> an<00:03:48.080> inch

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
you don't go over about 3/16 of an inch

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:59.980 
you don't go over about 3/16 of an inch
area<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:58.730> idea<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.180> you've<00:03:59.480> drilled<00:03:59.780> out

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
area the idea is that you've drilled out

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.080 
area the idea is that you've drilled out
all<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.440> old<00:04:00.470> insulation<00:04:00.980> from<00:04:01.430> inside<00:04:01.910> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
all the old insulation from inside the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.300 
all the old insulation from inside the
tubing<00:04:02.450> here<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.470> ready<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.830> receive

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
tubing here and it's ready to receive

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.840 
tubing here and it's ready to receive
the<00:04:04.460> new<00:04:04.610> wires

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.180 

it<00:04:10.540> should<00:04:10.810> now<00:04:10.930> be<00:04:10.990> pretty<00:04:11.380> easy<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.800> slide<00:04:12.040> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
it should now be pretty easy to slide it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.890 
it should now be pretty easy to slide it
over<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.430> wires<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.970> right<00:04:13.150> into<00:04:13.300> place
