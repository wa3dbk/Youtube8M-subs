so<00:06:16.810> one<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.140> things<00:06:17.200> we<00:06:17.470> talked<00:06:17.680> about<00:06:17.710> is

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
so one of the things we talked about is

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.530 
so one of the things we talked about is
that<00:06:18.250> hand<00:06:18.550> placement<00:06:19.060> with<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.270> hand<00:06:19.450> to

that hand placement with that hand to

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.200 
that hand placement with that hand to
hand<00:06:19.720> combat<00:06:19.780> needs<00:06:20.650> to<00:06:20.770> be<00:06:20.920> on<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.550> elbow

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
hand combat needs to be on that elbow

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.000 
hand combat needs to be on that elbow
because<00:06:22.840> if<00:06:22.990> we<00:06:23.110> can<00:06:23.200> get<00:06:23.260> out<00:06:23.440> on<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:23.710> elbow

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
because if we can get out on that elbow

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.470 
because if we can get out on that elbow
and<00:06:24.190> you<00:06:24.280> can<00:06:24.430> slow<00:06:24.670> it<00:06:24.700> down<00:06:24.820> for<00:06:25.210> me<00:06:25.330> right
