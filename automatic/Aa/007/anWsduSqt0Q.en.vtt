out<00:00:21.730> of<00:00:21.760> adjustment<00:00:22.170> it'll<00:00:23.170> slip<00:00:23.470> as<00:00:23.970> you're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
out of adjustment it'll slip as you're

as you're driving along you'll be

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.840 
as you're driving along you'll be
increasing<00:00:26.500> rpms<00:00:27.190> and<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:27.400> won't<00:00:27.550> be<00:00:27.640> going

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
increasing rpms and you won't be going
