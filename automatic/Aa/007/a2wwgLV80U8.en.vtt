00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.630
Two categories of molecules are primarily
responsible for photosynthesis in plants:

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.779
the chlorophylls and the carotenoids. Chlorophylls,
the green pigments, absorb certain wavelengths

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.680
of light that are then converted into chemical
energy. Chlorophylls are unstable molecules

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.640
and on exposure to air, water, and/or light,
will degrade to the pheophytins.The green

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.440
leafy vegetable spinach(Spinacia oleracea),
is a rich source of these pigments. The chlorphylls

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.720
present in spinach are Chlorophylls a&amp;b. Carotenoids,
the yellow pigments found in spinach, are

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.479
also involved in photosynthesis. Carotene
is the compound that gives butter and margarine

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:03.750
(marjarin) their characteristic yellow color.
In this experiment we will use the technique

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.090
of column chromatography to seperate the pigments
from the leaves of spinach. Column chromatography

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.940
is an isolation and purification technique
used extensively by organic chemists to obtain

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.899
pure samples of chemicals from natural sources
or from reaction sequences. In column chromatography,

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.909
a mixture of compounds is applied to the top
of a vertical column of solid adsorbent packed

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.000
in a tall, glass cylinder. As solvent is added
to the top of the column, the compounds move

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.001
down the column at different rates.If the
compounds are colored,as in our case, the

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:49.009
progress of the separation can simply be monitored
visually. The spinach “extract” is prepared

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.729
by first grinding fresh spinach using a mortar
and pestle and then extracting it with hexane:

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.210
acetone mixture in the ratio 1:1. This crude
extract is filtered and anhydrous sodium sulfate

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.509
was added to remove the traces of water. This
extract is once again filtered and adsorbed

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.400
on about 3g of silica gel and dried, to afford
a free flowing silica gel with the crude extract

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.190
adsorbed on it. A chromatographic column is
packed with about 25g of silica gel in hexane

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.510
and the crude extract adsorbed on silica gel
is added to the top carefully. The column

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.140
is then run using hexane, when the non-polar.
carotene will elute out first as a yellow

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.610
band. It is collected in small conical flasks
as it flows out of the column. When the Carotene

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.939
band is completely elutes out, acetone is
added to the column so that the polar components

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.680
chlrophylls-a&amp;b will elute out as a single
band. This is also collected as in previous

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.760
case and the fractions are later rotavaporated
to obtain pure. Carotene and chlorophylls

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.340
as yellowish orange and green color solids
respectively.
