 Jesus started preaching and talking about God 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.219
 from a very young age 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.899
 the bible puts it at 12 when 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.340
 it escapes parents and what 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.260

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.900
 says that jesus was the firstborn of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 Mary is saying her first child is 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.210
 expression indicates that she had more than one 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210
 son 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.210
 Jesus learned and worked in the profession 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.310
 from his father jose who was not a carpenter 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.260
 but artisan was a man physically 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 strong 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.019
 Jesus was almost Egyptian lived a lot 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.720
 time there had a relative is said to 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.790
 an uncle named nicodemo by which no 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.790
 he was alien to other religions and gods 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.540
 he was aware of his purpose what 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.099
 happened and would happen at all times but 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 he had different ways of carrying his 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.079
 messages according to the level of understanding 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.060
 of his followers he knew that his gospel 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.060
 It was for all Jews and Gentiles 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.849
 when he went to pray for a miracle missed 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.370
 from the place to the people he perceived 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.180
 without faith or they were declaring something 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.879
 contrary to the miracle 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.129
 in the scriptures Jesus mentions that the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.709
 we are not Jews who will eat 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.140
 of the crumbs that fall from the table by 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.090
 that gets very angry with the Jews because 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.090
 them in the town chosen by god 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.140
 according to osteological studies and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.600
 scriptures jesus was not a cheerful man 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.790
 on the contrary he lived worried about the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.340
 existence of the human being 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.530
 Jesus had to behave like a man and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.049
 not as god for his purpose to be 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.569
 fulfilled he knew he had come to 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.640
 suffer and die as a human if the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.530
 holy spirit would have remained in him 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 the plan of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.939
 redemption would have been impossible 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.670
 arrest him hit him and crucify him 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:48.180
 as any man Jesus felt 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.099
 weak he became depressed and asked the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.099
 father who will pass from him the cup 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.170
 the gospels tell us that Jesus 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.870
 he started to sweat blood when he was 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.420
 praying in the Mount of Olives 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.489
 especially in the garden of getsemaní 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.920
 this is not a poetic language but a 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.920
 medical condition called in mate and dose 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.299
 It is not very common but it can occur when 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.900
 there is a high degree of suffering 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.900
 psychological 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.350
 in the forbidden gospel of judas is 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.650
 stresses that he was not the traitor 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.800
 we all think according to this text was a 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.170
 agreement with Jesus since he needed to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.510
 someone who will press him he was chosen 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.190
 because Pedro did not accept since he knew that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.280
 would be repudiated forever by the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.380
 humanity and judas if you thought that out of love 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.380
 Jesus would do what was necessary 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.160
 at that time the accustomed people 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.020
 to place olive branches blankets and palms 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.720
 on the feet of the mounts of the kings 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.660
 that entered the cities of this 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.449
 way when jesus centers jerusalem the 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.160
 people identified him as the messiah and he is 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.580
 How is the reception with 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 palmas not a week went by when this 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.720
 same people was the cause of the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.910
 humiliation he suffered because of contempt 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.310
 and the teasing that took him carrying his 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.289
 own cross for almost two kilometers and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.740
 that spit in his face and threw him 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.650
 stones 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.990
 the death of jesus was even worse than 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.759
 a common crucifixion not to all 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.069
 convicted criminals worked them to 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.069
 the cross many were only tied 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.110
 the pain that Jesus suffered was so 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.780
 unbearable that literally not 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.190
 there were words to describe it 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.520
 he had to invent a new word 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.889
 exclusionary call that means from the 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.319
 cross to describe such pain 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.569
 Jesus wore a linen tunic without 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.419
 sewing from a single fabric from top to 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.550
 down this type of tunic they only used it 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.189
 rich men that time was 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.169
 so valuable that after crucifying him 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.819
 the soldiers cast lots on 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.819
 she to see who was left 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.830
 according to a legend Jesus had a second 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.510
 life north of india it is told that 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.840
 Jesus survived the wounds that 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.090
 will cause the crucifixion then began 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.590
 a second life in cashmere to where 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.440
 He came in search of the ten tribes 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.260
 Israel lost there died of very old age 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.390
 advanced natural death according to this 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.760
 theory is buried in the capital of 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.280
 cashmere where his grave is venerated 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.280
 for almost 1900 years 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.850
 the Jews still await the coming of the 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.370
 messiahs do not believe in Jesus for the 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.380
 following reasons did not bring happens the 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.210
 world his messages were 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.120
 contradictory with respect to the old 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.910
 testament was not descended from the king 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.800
 David the Elijah prophet had to have 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.400
 come before the arrival of Christ 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.070
 thing that did not happen did not build the 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.620
 third temple and not only that but that 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.849
 also after his death the second 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.129
 temple was destroyed 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.050
 after his arrival he would gather all the 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:06.520
 Jews of the world thing that either 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.039
 happened it did not bring peace to israel with the 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.779
 death would be death 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.779
 another thing that did not happen either
