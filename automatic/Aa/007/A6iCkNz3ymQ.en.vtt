video of how to make one of these this
is<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.200> temporary<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.070> tried<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.639> red

I<00:00:20.779> took<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.680> rubber<00:00:22.949> connection<00:00:23.730> piece<00:00:23.970> from

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
I took the rubber connection piece from

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.720 
I took the rubber connection piece from
a<00:00:24.539> 91<00:00:25.289> temple<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.279> little<00:00:26.550> rubber

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
a 91 temple which is this little rubber

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.919 
a 91 temple which is this little rubber
thing<00:00:27.199> sliced<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> razor<00:00:28.830> blade<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
thing sliced it with a razor blade and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
thing sliced it with a razor blade and
now<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.619> done<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> glue

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
now I would have done this with a glue

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
now I would have done this with a glue
gun<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.000> ran<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> glue<00:00:33.719> stick<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
gun but I ran out of glue stick so I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.370 
gun but I ran out of glue stick so I
made<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> tape<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> old<00:00:36.120> air<00:00:36.270> filter<00:00:36.719> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
made it with tape and old air filter so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.350 
made it with tape and old air filter so
I<00:00:37.410> curled<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> air<00:00:38.129> filter<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.879> circle

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I curled the air filter into a circle

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.770 
I curled the air filter into a circle
then<00:00:40.170> wrap<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> edges<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.160> tape<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
then wrap the edges in tape and then I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.479 
then wrap the edges in tape and then I
wrapped<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.010> tighten<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
wrapped it on that and then tighten that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
wrapped it on that and then tighten that
up<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.059> intake<00:00:46.020> manifold<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:48.989> got

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
up to my intake manifold and so it's got

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:05.200 
up to my intake manifold and so it's got
filter<00:00:49.590> paper<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> sounds
