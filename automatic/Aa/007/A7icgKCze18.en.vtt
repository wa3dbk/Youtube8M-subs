00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
just because I resist it but I also

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.070 
just because I resist it but I also
didn't<00:04:29.530> know<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:30.400> at<00:04:30.550> half<00:04:30.760> but<00:04:31.480> that's<00:04:31.870> what

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
didn't know I so at half but that's what

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.530 
didn't know I so at half but that's what
right<00:04:32.410> there<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.710> what<00:04:32.949> tells<00:04:33.100> me<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.610> he's

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
right there is what tells me that he's

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.000 
right there is what tells me that he's
bulky<00:04:34.960> because<00:04:35.350> he<00:04:36.040> took<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.940> uh<00:04:36.970> oh<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.710> then

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
bulky because he took the uh oh and then

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.219 
bulky because he took the uh oh and then
of<00:04:39.280> course<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.940> it's<00:04:40.360> actually<00:04:40.750> like<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.050> said

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
of course this it's actually like I said

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.070 
of course this it's actually like I said
it's<00:04:41.350> my<00:04:41.470> specs<00:04:41.770> pidgeot<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.690> he's<00:04:43.690> obviously

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's my specs pidgeot so he's obviously

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.820 
it's my specs pidgeot so he's obviously
invested<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.310> lot<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.729> bulk<00:04:46.530> because<00:04:47.530> of<00:04:47.710> the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
invested a lot in bulk because of the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.770 
invested a lot in bulk because of the
like<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.820> shouldn't<00:04:49.150> have<00:04:49.240> been<00:04:49.270> able<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.570> take

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
like it shouldn't have been able to take

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.159 
like it shouldn't have been able to take
aspects<00:04:50.290> stab<00:04:50.800> hyper<00:04:51.100> beam<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:52.330> well<00:04:52.660> like

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
aspects stab hyper beam that well like

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.659 
aspects stab hyper beam that well like
it<00:04:53.350> well<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> mean<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.979> didn't<00:04:54.430> take<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.550> that

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
it well I mean I didn't take it that
