but<00:01:49.380> we're<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> slap<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:51.090> if

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
but we're going to slap it in and see if

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.230 
but we're going to slap it in and see if
it<00:01:51.509> does<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.100> only<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.520> 25

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it does because it was only like 25

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
it does because it was only like 25
bucks<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.659> shipping<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.890> guess<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.850> long<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

it<00:01:57.240> seals<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.869> enough<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.170> me

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
it seals good enough for me

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
action engine eight they've actually

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.890 
action engine eight they've actually
machined<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.820> out<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.270> bit<00:03:27.420> bigger<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.870> I

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
machined it out a little bit bigger so I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.440 
machined it out a little bit bigger so I
can<00:03:28.110> get<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.290> top<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:29.030> not<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.360> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
can get on top of that not because I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.970 
can get on top of that not because I
wasn't<00:03:30.690> able<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.900> find<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.170> proper<00:03:31.560> wrench<00:03:31.770> so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.050 
really apply to you but here in Canada
I've<00:05:19.680> seen<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.130> temperatures<00:05:20.520> get<00:05:20.700> down<00:05:20.730> to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
I've seen the temperatures get down to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.690 
I've seen the temperatures get down to
minus<00:05:21.390> 45<00:05:21.810> degrees<00:05:22.230> in<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.590> wintertime<00:05:22.800> so

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
minus 45 degrees in the wintertime so

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.520 
minus 45 degrees in the wintertime so
you<00:05:23.760> want<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.030> make<00:05:24.150> sure<00:05:24.300> your<00:05:24.450> coolant<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.140> at

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
you want to make sure your coolant is at

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.990 
you want to make sure your coolant is at
least<00:05:25.710> minus<00:05:26.160> 40<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:26.580> we're<00:05:26.670> going<00:05:26.760> to<00:05:26.850> check

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
least minus 40 so we're going to check

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.360 
least minus 40 so we're going to check
that<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.510> see<00:05:27.560> where<00:05:28.560> my<00:05:28.620> coolant<00:05:28.920> level<00:05:29.130> sets

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
that and see where my coolant level sets

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.750 
that and see where my coolant level sets
are<00:05:29.670> sitting<00:05:30.510> for<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.720> winter<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.760> hopefully

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
are sitting for the winter and hopefully

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.810 
are sitting for the winter and hopefully
we're<00:05:32.910> good<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:34.680> here<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:34.980> are<00:05:35.010> right<00:05:35.130> now<00:05:35.460> it

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
we're good so here we are right now it

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.250 
we're good so here we are right now it
says<00:05:36.090> on<00:05:36.150> my<00:05:36.390> temperature<00:05:36.840> we're<00:05:37.020> set<00:05:37.230> for

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
says on my temperature we're set for

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.010 
says on my temperature we're set for
minus<00:05:37.740> 45<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.640> above<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.750> shouldn't<00:05:39.930> have

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
minus 45 and above so I shouldn't have

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.560 
minus 45 and above so I shouldn't have
to<00:05:40.170> worry<00:05:40.200> about<00:05:40.380> my<00:05:40.620> antifreeze<00:05:41.480> freezing<00:05:42.480> up

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
to worry about my antifreeze freezing up

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.910 
to worry about my antifreeze freezing up
in<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:42.720> winter<00:05:42.900> time<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.260> cracking<00:05:43.590> my<00:05:43.680> engine

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
in the winter time of cracking my engine

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.530 
in the winter time of cracking my engine
block<00:05:44.010> so<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.370> part<00:05:44.580> we're<00:05:44.700> good

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
block so that part we're good

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.940 
block so that part we're good
the<00:05:45.870> only<00:05:45.990> thing<00:05:46.230> left<00:05:46.380> I'm<00:05:46.590> going<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.770> check

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
the only thing left I'm going to check

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.360 
the only thing left I'm going to check
out<00:05:47.330> as<00:05:48.330> I'm<00:05:48.570> have<00:05:48.750> a<00:05:48.780> secondary<00:05:49.440> error<00:05:49.830> code

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
out as I'm have a secondary error code

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.950 
out as I'm have a secondary error code
low<00:05:50.790> I<00:05:51.710> know<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.920> pump<00:05:53.190> works<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:54.690> check

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
low I know the pump works the check

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.720 
low I know the pump works the check
valve<00:05:54.990> right<00:05:55.380> there<00:05:55.650> I<00:05:55.680> swapped<00:05:56.070> out<00:05:56.310> I'm

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
valve right there I swapped out I'm

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.050 
valve right there I swapped out I'm
going<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.800> check<00:05:58.800> for<00:05:58.830> vacuum<00:05:59.370> leak<00:05:59.550> now<00:05:59.760> and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
going to check for vacuum leak now and

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.080 
going to check for vacuum leak now and
see<00:06:00.810> if<00:06:00.870> we<00:06:00.990> can<00:06:01.140> find<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.440> problem<00:06:01.860> on<00:06:02.090> why

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
see if we can find the problem on why

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.840 
see if we can find the problem on why
that's<00:06:03.420> happening<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.260> cool<00:06:05.220> behind<00:06:05.550> tread

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
that's happening so cool behind tread

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.340 
that's happening so cool behind tread
check<00:06:06.060> for<00:06:06.240> leaks<00:06:06.420> we're<00:06:06.600> blowing<00:06:06.930> into<00:06:07.200> it

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
check for leaks we're blowing into it

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.350 
check for leaks we're blowing into it
and<00:06:07.620> now<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:08.220> got<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.490> vacuum<00:06:08.730> gauge<00:06:08.910> hooked<00:06:09.240> up

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
and now I got a vacuum gauge hooked up

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.640 
and now I got a vacuum gauge hooked up
to<00:06:09.510> it<00:06:09.540> so<00:06:09.690> I'm<00:06:09.750> going<00:06:09.870> to<00:06:09.900> start<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.200> card<00:06:10.440> see

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
to it so I'm going to start to card see

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.050 
to it so I'm going to start to card see
what<00:06:10.740> kind<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.890> vacuum<00:06:11.130> I'm<00:06:11.430> pulling<00:06:11.760> off<00:06:11.880> this

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
what kind of vacuum I'm pulling off this

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.840 
what kind of vacuum I'm pulling off this
thing<00:06:12.530> we<00:06:13.530> do<00:06:13.650> anything<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.160> got<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.430> reset<00:06:14.730> the

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
thing we do anything I got to reset the

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.990 
thing we do anything I got to reset the
oil<00:06:15.000> light<00:06:16.190> if<00:06:17.190> you<00:06:17.280> have<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:17.520> of<00:06:17.610> these<00:06:17.700> peak

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
oil light if you have one of these peak

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.210 
oil light if you have one of these peak
scanners<00:06:18.540> you<00:06:18.900> just<00:06:19.080> go<00:06:19.170> to<00:06:19.260> oil<00:06:21.980> gonna<00:06:22.980> do<00:06:23.100> its

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
scanners you just go to oil gonna do its

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.070 
scanners you just go to oil gonna do its
little<00:06:23.280> countdown

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
little countdown

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.909 
little countdown
that's<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.320> should<00:06:25.530> be<00:06:25.620> done

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.209 

so<00:06:28.580> you<00:06:28.789> reset<00:06:29.150> your<00:06:29.180> oil<00:06:29.449> service<00:06:30.039> should<00:06:31.039> go

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
so you reset your oil service should go

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:37.570 
so you reset your oil service should go
back<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:32.289> 25,000<00:06:35.830> going<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.889> start<00:06:37.189> it<00:06:37.310> ticking

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
back to 25,000 going to start it ticking

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.920 
back to 25,000 going to start it ticking
her<00:06:37.639> back<00:06:37.819> and<00:06:37.999> we<00:06:38.090> pull

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.200 

I<00:06:41.960> pretty<00:06:42.920> much<00:06:43.010> concludes<00:06:43.490> my<00:06:43.610> video<00:06:43.790> for<00:06:44.150> the

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
I pretty much concludes my video for the

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.000 
I pretty much concludes my video for the
winter<00:06:44.450> -<00:06:44.600> blasting<00:06:45.170> idea<00:06:45.500> to<00:06:45.650> show<00:06:45.920> that

winter - blasting idea to show that

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.790 
winter - blasting idea to show that
video<00:06:46.340> because<00:06:46.700> everybody<00:06:47.180> should<00:06:47.450> know<00:06:47.800> how

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
video because everybody should know how

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.890

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
see in the video I didn't have any

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.170 
see in the video I didn't have any
vacuum<00:06:52.730> but<00:06:52.970> that<00:06:53.120> could<00:06:53.300> be<00:06:53.480> due<00:06:53.690> to<00:06:55.180> danger

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
only going to kick in when it's first

only going to kick in when it's first
cold<00:07:01.160> for<00:07:01.340> like<00:07:01.430> 15-20<00:07:02.390> seconds<00:07:02.900> roughly<00:07:03.280> the

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
engine was already in the temperature

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.640 
engine was already in the temperature
range<00:07:05.630> a<00:07:05.840> little<00:07:05.900> bit<00:07:06.110> I<00:07:06.170> thought<00:07:06.410> it<00:07:06.530> would

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
range a little bit I thought it would

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.650 
range a little bit I thought it would
have<00:07:06.740> cooled<00:07:06.980> down<00:07:07.040> enough<00:07:07.460> when<00:07:07.790> I<00:07:08.030> was<00:07:08.510> doing

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
have cooled down enough when I was doing

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.540 
have cooled down enough when I was doing
all<00:07:08.840> the<00:07:08.990> maintenance<00:07:09.200> my<00:07:09.530> guess<00:07:09.740> not<00:07:09.980> so<00:07:10.520> I

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
all the maintenance my guess not so I

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.920 
all the maintenance my guess not so I
might<00:07:10.940> have<00:07:11.060> to<00:07:11.180> try<00:07:11.360> it<00:07:11.420> again<00:07:11.540> when<00:07:11.840> it's

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
might have to try it again when it's

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.380 
might have to try it again when it's
cold<00:07:12.170> out<00:07:12.380> I<00:07:12.620> did<00:07:13.430> feel<00:07:13.670> around<00:07:13.970> four<00:07:14.240> broken

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
cold out I did feel around four broken

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.270 
cold out I did feel around four broken
hoses<00:07:14.900> I<00:07:14.990> couldn't<00:07:15.290> feel<00:07:15.440> anything<00:07:15.680> I<00:07:15.920> hooked

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
hoses I couldn't feel anything I hooked

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.590 
hoses I couldn't feel anything I hooked
up<00:07:16.430> air<00:07:17.030> to<00:07:17.330> it<00:07:17.450> with<00:07:17.830> 15<00:07:18.830> psi<00:07:19.370> and<00:07:19.700> belt<00:07:20.450> around

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
up air to it with 15 psi and belt around

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.300 
up air to it with 15 psi and belt around
for<00:07:20.900> leaks<00:07:21.110> in<00:07:21.290> the<00:07:21.320> line<00:07:21.530> and<00:07:21.770> find<00:07:21.980> anything

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
for leaks in the line and find anything

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.270 
for leaks in the line and find anything
so<00:07:22.990> it's<00:07:23.990> definitely<00:07:24.380> puzzling<00:07:24.950> me<00:07:25.070> while

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
so it's definitely puzzling me while

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.970 
so it's definitely puzzling me while
getting<00:07:25.490> the<00:07:25.670> secondary<00:07:26.120> air<00:07:26.270> cooled<00:07:26.690> but

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:26.980 
getting the secondary air cooled but

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.260 
getting the secondary air cooled but
eventually<00:07:27.980> I'll<00:07:28.190> figure<00:07:28.370> dogs<00:07:28.640> only<00:07:28.880> happens

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
eventually I'll figure dogs only happens

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.120 
eventually I'll figure dogs only happens
when<00:07:29.360> it's<00:07:29.420> cold<00:07:29.690> out<00:07:29.840> anyways<00:07:30.590> thats<00:07:30.860> ended

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130 
when it's cold out anyways thats ended

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.440 
when it's cold out anyways thats ended
