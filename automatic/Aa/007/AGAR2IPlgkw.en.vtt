00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.829
 what do you need so let's start as you know 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.790
 I have lived a lot of different machines and 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.310
 constantly have to deal with them 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 repair and any other things ordered here 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.329
 such is the tool holder 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.180
 let's see but because everything is scattered 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.750
 somewhere in parts here lying around here 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.440
 lying around and very uncomfortable so it is on top 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.790
 probably here it is on miss so so 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.290
 wait a second 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.089
 Hop and top dress now my even 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.030

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.159

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 pretty good yes you can be interesting 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.030
 fold here the knife will poor fall 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.729
 there so plus is already perfectly different 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.700
 liquid I have here in the dampers 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.510
 differential and paint of different viscosity 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:31.440
 I gained useful and Markovna not know 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:36.820
 everywhere superfood so this sachet 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.680
 more sachets and so a tool about 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.950
 tool now i'll tell you if you 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.229
 buy a car krupinski get 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.530
 Included usually with him as a certain 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.630
 g-shaped tool hexagons 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.950
 but they are very inconvenient to work therefore I 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 I recommend you buy say so 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.049
 quality tool 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.700
 immediately here it is stomped i can he chose 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.860
 watched their varieties very fully 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.140
 scenes, too, you can fully specify one 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.810
 screwdriver can be bought for 15 bucks 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 For example, there are screwdrivers for 5 bucks 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.889
 Well, the prices are different. 710 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 do not look at us as metal 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:24.790
 such hobby king of ski screwdrivers because 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 that quality is about nothing 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.010
 so here it is convenient to be located 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.109
 thinks he hobby just himself through it 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.569
 passed saved buying offer by 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.239
 one and a half dollars on a tenge cube at the very 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.549
 In fact, this is only one transfer of money 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.749
 here I have a half two two and a half 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.569
 three millimeters 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:45.249
 The most running such and in principle such 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.169
 packaging is still interesting here 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:52.079
 all sorts of cogs will impose so it 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.389
 good next 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.870
 perry we fill the shock absorbers so soon we 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:03.249
 waiting for a video like perezalivat on mars 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.359
 such an interesting device 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:08.949
 device for holding the shock absorber then 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.499
 there is here we put the shock absorbers it will 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.240
 insist on air all the bubbles 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.240
 got out of 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.640
 nevada roughly speaking but then I'll show you 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.040
 You can also use the tool here. 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.670
 try here if something like this 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.590
 so hang out but what does this go for 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.500
 further further further so about again 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.800
 tool coming back I have left 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.050
 Cuba king skih a lot of these pens 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:44.010
 different we grind the screwdriver itself 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.840
 very quickly grind and 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:53.650
 left a bunch of all sorts of pens and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.560
 You can additionally just buy on 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.110
 one and a half to two millimeters and the old 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.320
 insert pen yes that is what it is 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.930
 I am also occupying therefore a tool 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.660
 keep the car at home there somewhere else 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.080
 this is a lot to 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.970
 make your life easier 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.900
 where is the second part of the video on the other 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.040
 the parcel goes for 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.340
 well, screwdriver say then 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.130
 an electric screwdriver is suitable therefore 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.070
 a lot of twist we get up and therefore 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 such interesting things are sold too 2 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:35.130
 there is one and a half millimeter inch there is something 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.650
 there is a need to watch it so we had 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.840
 too yes here we have it for shock absorbers 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.700
 and now I will not have such a device 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.960
 open just show too for 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.430
 shock absorbers fit so took it 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.990
 look at compare let's say so with this 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.050
 then it will be necessary 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.390
 both put together so this thing is going to 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.220
 principle is cheap what's there 7 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.200
 dollars what or but will be pretty 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.360
 useful thing 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.730
 and the last swamp left is me 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.810
 for 10 scale that is if we will 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.260
 small wheelbarrow to sort out in principle 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.110
 nothing in it there is no such 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.300
 can i do homemade so far 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.130
 it is not clear from what you can in the box but 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.720
 here we have 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.320
 rubber spacers 2 so that the car does not 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.680
 slid 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.930
 even her bottom was flat up to either 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.020
 recess in the center and can spin 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.470
 there are also compartments for our everyones 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.240
 screws and other stuff 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.950
 scale and also here is such a us for 8 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.310
 scales of the hour we look at the difference 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:52.760
 you chose chose look there kind of 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:54.800
 differ so well yes more significant but 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.530
 here here is a little bit of branches though 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.370
 also 2 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:04.130
 so inserted here and inserted here a 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:08.570
 top cover on look the same in 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:12.530
 the principle of the size of the base with us 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.450
 more height more like as 8 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.450
 scale let's say we have large 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.010
 wheels so that the car hung above 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.840
 above ground principle is convenient i find that 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.490
 you can twist in all directions well 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.450
 let's see how it will be in operation 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.850
 but when there is no such thing oh sorry what 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.840
 squeaked like that so useful here 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.670
 today pokupochka such elsewhere 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.730
 the second package I ordered more on the very 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.730
 In fact, under all kinds of yes there are two or three 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:47.840
 millimeter because you have to twist 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:50.420
 very much and so here we are with liquid 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.720
 Thank you all, such a purchase was 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.460
 very useful and prices for a handful 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.080
 it will be easier to sort out cars 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.080
 thank you all to see you soon
