00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
so let's go ahead and install this now

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.599 
so let's go ahead and install this now
this<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:27.940> said<00:02:28.120> two<00:02:28.269> pieces<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.609> you

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
this is like I said two pieces and you

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.319 
this is like I said two pieces and you
can<00:02:30.850> detach<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.340> right<00:02:33.549> here<00:02:34.109> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
can detach like you see right here the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.080 
can detach like you see right here the
plastic<00:02:37.329> part<00:02:37.920> from<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.070> hard<00:02:39.310> plastic<00:02:39.760> or

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
plastic part from the hard plastic or

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.970 
plastic part from the hard plastic or
the<00:02:40.750> rubber<00:02:40.989> piece<00:02:41.320> from<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> hard<00:02:41.799> plastic

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
the rubber piece from the hard plastic

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
the rubber piece from the hard plastic
but<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> wouldn't<00:02:42.730> recommend<00:02:42.850> doing<00:02:43.299> that<00:02:43.420> just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
but I wouldn't recommend doing that just

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.740 
but I wouldn't recommend doing that just
leave<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.380> CDs<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.600> basically<00:02:46.600> what

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
leave it as CDs and basically what

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
leave it as CDs and basically what
