hi<00:00:04.100> everybody<00:00:04.370> this<00:00:04.850> is<00:00:04.910> my<00:00:05.210> first<00:00:05.510> flash

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
hi everybody this is my first flash

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.170 
hi everybody this is my first flash
animation<00:00:06.560> that<00:00:06.740> I've<00:00:06.920> created<00:00:07.339> and<00:00:07.759> added

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
animation that I've created and added

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.660 
animation that I've created and added
some<00:00:08.389> basic<00:00:09.020> tools<00:00:09.230> that<00:00:09.559> I've<00:00:10.070> learned<00:00:10.460> over

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
some basic tools that I've learned over

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.650 
some basic tools that I've learned over
a<00:00:11.000> week<00:00:11.469> the<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:12.500> car<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.849> van<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:14.420> the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
a week the the car the van and the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.109 
a week the the car the van and the
clothes<00:00:14.900> are<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:15.440> simple<00:00:16.009> motion<00:00:16.790> tween

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
clothes are you simple motion tween

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.170 
clothes are you simple motion tween
whereas<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.140> Sun<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:18.619> saved<00:00:19.099> as<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.489> movie<00:00:19.970> clip

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
whereas the Sun is saved as a movie clip

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.950 
whereas the Sun is saved as a movie clip
object<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.200> then<00:00:22.009> globe<00:00:22.820> blur<00:00:23.239> filters<00:00:23.779> are

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
object and then globe blur filters are

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.380 
object and then globe blur filters are
applied<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.290> it<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.890> animate<00:00:25.310> is<00:00:25.550> shining<00:00:26.270> a

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
applied to it to animate is shining a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.770 
applied to it to animate is shining a
fair

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.689 

you

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.740 

in<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:44.170> Sun<00:00:44.350> animation<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.480> concept<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.660> very

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
in the Sun animation the concept is very

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.259 
in the Sun animation the concept is very
simple<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:47.789> draw<00:00:48.789> a<00:00:49.030> Sun<00:00:49.769> and<00:00:50.769> save<00:00:51.729> it<00:00:52.000> as<00:00:52.239> a

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
simple you draw a Sun and save it as a

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.590 
simple you draw a Sun and save it as a
symbol<00:00:52.870> with<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.170> type<00:00:53.589> movie<00:00:54.070> clip<00:00:54.449> reason<00:00:55.449> to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
symbol with a type movie clip reason to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.349 
symbol with a type movie clip reason to
make<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.989> movie<00:00:56.379> clip<00:00:56.559> is<00:00:56.829> because<00:00:57.399> that's

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
make it a movie clip is because that's

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.410 
make it a movie clip is because that's
where<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.839> can<00:00:59.079> apply<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.619> filters<00:01:00.369> and<00:01:00.640> one

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
where you can apply the filters and one

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.529 
where you can apply the filters and one
of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.719> filter<00:01:02.079> types<00:01:02.409> is<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.920> glue<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.609> blur

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
of the filter types is a glue or blur

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.410 
of the filter types is a glue or blur
and<00:01:05.250> that's<00:01:06.250> pretty<00:01:06.640> much<00:01:06.789> it

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
and that's pretty much it

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.420 
and that's pretty much it
the<00:01:08.340> trick<00:01:09.340> behind<00:01:09.659> making<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:11.430> Sunim

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
the trick behind making a Sunim

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.330 
the trick behind making a Sunim
animation<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.570> shows<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.679> glowing<00:01:15.190> effect

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
animation that shows a glowing effect

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
animation that shows a glowing effect
you<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> first<00:01:16.840> keyframe<00:01:17.289> you<00:01:17.789> insert<00:01:18.789> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you make a first keyframe you insert the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
you make a first keyframe you insert the
the<00:01:20.500> image<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:22.119> change<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.600> values<00:01:22.899> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the image and you change the values of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.070 
the image and you change the values of
the<00:01:23.409> glow<00:01:23.860> on<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.399> first<00:01:25.060> keyframe<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.929> then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the glow on your first keyframe and then

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.559 
the glow on your first keyframe and then
you<00:01:26.170> move<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.679> last<00:01:26.920> keyframe<00:01:27.610> change<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
you move to the last keyframe change the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.070 
you move to the last keyframe change the
values<00:01:28.869> there<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.500> then<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.659> come<00:01:31.869> back<00:01:31.899> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
values there and then you come back to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.460 
values there and then you come back to
the<00:01:32.409> first<00:01:32.709> frame<00:01:33.069> and<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.670> add<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.959> motion

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
the first frame and you add the motion

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.109 
the first frame and you add the motion
tween<00:01:35.799> and<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:37.709> you<00:01:38.709> will<00:01:38.860> play<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.280> you'll<00:01:39.729> see

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
tween and as you will play it you'll see

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.969 
tween and as you will play it you'll see
there<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.690> some<00:01:41.580> an<00:01:42.580> animation<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:44.049> Sun

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
there is some an animation of Sun

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.429 
there is some an animation of Sun
basically<00:01:45.220> blowing<00:01:45.909> or<00:01:46.270> shining<00:01:46.899> that's

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
basically blowing or shining that's

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.630 
basically blowing or shining that's
pretty<00:01:47.799> much<00:01:47.979> it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.730 

we<00:01:55.640> will<00:01:55.909> quickly<00:01:56.390> go<00:01:56.630> through<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.229> process

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
we will quickly go through the process

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.190 
we will quickly go through the process
of<00:01:57.920> creating<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.670> motion<00:01:59.390> tween<00:01:59.570> for<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
of creating a motion tween for the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.219 
of creating a motion tween for the
clouds<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:01.009> show<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:02.150> clouds<00:02:02.509> moving<00:02:02.900> from

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
clouds to show the clouds moving from

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.649 
clouds to show the clouds moving from
one<00:02:03.440> side<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.770> another<00:02:04.009> side<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
one side to another side in the in the

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.150 
one side to another side in the in the
screen<00:02:06.580> same<00:02:07.580> principle<00:02:08.090> can<00:02:08.119> be<00:02:08.450> used<00:02:08.690> for

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
screen same principle can be used for

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.090 
screen same principle can be used for
for<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> car<00:02:10.520> or<00:02:10.819> or<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.540> van<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.620> simple

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
for the car or or the van it's a simple

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.790 
for the car or or the van it's a simple
standard<00:02:13.430> motion<00:02:14.120> tween<00:02:14.480> which<00:02:15.319> basically

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
standard motion tween which basically

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.720 
standard motion tween which basically
involves<00:02:16.959> creating<00:02:17.959> an<00:02:18.080> object<00:02:18.520> saved<00:02:19.520> as<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
involves creating an object saved as a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.229 
involves creating an object saved as a
symbol<00:02:20.920> cloud<00:02:21.920> symbol<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:24.280> saving<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.459> with<00:02:26.150> a

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
symbol cloud symbol and saving it with a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.130 
symbol cloud symbol and saving it with a
type<00:02:26.600> graphic<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:28.190> added<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
type graphic then we added on the on the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.440 
type graphic then we added on the on the
first<00:02:30.950> frame<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:33.560> frame<00:02:34.209> becomes<00:02:35.209> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
first frame and that frame becomes a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.680 
first frame and that frame becomes a
keyframe<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:38.150> extreme

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
keyframe and then on the other extreme

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.930 
keyframe and then on the other extreme
and<00:02:39.019> where<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.590> animation<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> supposed<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
and where the animation is supposed to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.500 
and where the animation is supposed to
end<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.360> add<00:02:41.600> another<00:02:42.019> keyframe<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.610> then<00:02:44.269> we

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
end we add another keyframe and then we

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.500 
end we add another keyframe and then we
come<00:02:44.750> back<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.230> first<00:02:45.560> frame<00:02:46.480> where<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
come back on the first frame where the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.710 
come back on the first frame where the
animation<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.260> supposed<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.769> start<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.720> create

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
animation is supposed to start we create

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.009 
animation is supposed to start we create
a<00:02:50.750> motion<00:02:51.140> tween<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:52.390> basically<00:02:53.390> after

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
a motion tween and basically after

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.250 
a motion tween and basically after
creating<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.799> motion<00:02:55.280> tween<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.330> go<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
creating that motion tween we go to the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.590 
creating that motion tween we go to the
other<00:02:57.560> extreme<00:02:57.739> end<00:02:58.730> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:01.120> where<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.329> added

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
other extreme end of the where we added

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.259 
other extreme end of the where we added
the<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:04.400> key<00:03:04.730> frame<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:06.290> simply<00:03:07.280> drag<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
the the key frame and we simply drag the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.420 
the the key frame and we simply drag the
cloud<00:03:09.579> object<00:03:10.579> or<00:03:10.820> symbol<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.200> other<00:03:12.560> side

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
cloud object or symbol to the other side

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.180 
cloud object or symbol to the other side
of<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.850> screen<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:15.049> what<00:03:15.230> would<00:03:15.410> happen<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.980> as

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
of the screen so what would happen is as

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.509 
of the screen so what would happen is as
we<00:03:16.760> will<00:03:16.970> play<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.450> video<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.950> flash<00:03:19.250> would

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
we will play the video the flash would

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.259 
we will play the video the flash would
create<00:03:20.390> or<00:03:20.840> any<00:03:21.260> made<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.450> in-between<00:03:23.769> frames

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
create or any made the in-between frames

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.539 
create or any made the in-between frames
all<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.510> clothes<00:03:26.840> also<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.739> will<00:03:27.920> be<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> smooth

all the clothes also it will be a smooth
movement<00:03:29.410> same<00:03:30.410> principle<00:03:30.920> has<00:03:31.070> been<00:03:31.100> used

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
movement same principle has been used

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:41.570 
movement same principle has been used
for<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.150> car<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.810> van
