so let's just drop right in and we're

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:30.130 
so let's just drop right in and we're
gonna<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> key<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.039> G<00:00:17.340> G<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.659 

okay<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> three<00:00:31.949> four<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.430> signature

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
okay this is a three four time signature

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.430 
okay this is a three four time signature
which<00:00:33.239> means<00:00:33.540> there's<00:00:33.780> three<00:00:33.870> beats<00:00:34.260> each

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
which means there's three beats each

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110 
which means there's three beats each
measure<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> Cornell<00:00:35.430> gets<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> beat

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
measure and the Cornell gets the beat

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150 
measure and the Cornell gets the beat
this<00:00:36.720> actually<00:00:37.020> starts<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> pickup

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this actually starts with the pickup

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.600 
this actually starts with the pickup
note<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> again<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> pickup<00:00:40.440> note<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.010> an

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
note and again a pickup note is an

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
note and again a pickup note is an
incomplete<00:00:42.239> measure<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.530> doesn't<00:00:43.829> start

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
incomplete measure so it doesn't start

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.090 
incomplete measure so it doesn't start
on<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.400> but<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.790> starts<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> count<00:00:45.540> three

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
on one but this starts on count three

00:00:46.100 --> 00:01:14.230 
on one but this starts on count three
okay<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.580> beginning<00:00:47.940> note<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.400> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.700 

okay<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.450> lot<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> information<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.440> let's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
okay a lot of information there so let's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
okay a lot of information there so let's
go<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.760> more<00:01:17.850> time

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
go back and let's do that one more time

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.870 
go back and let's do that one more time
before<00:01:18.300> we<00:01:18.510> start<00:01:18.750> putting<00:01:18.870> fortunes<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.620> that

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
before we start putting fortunes to that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.620 
before we start putting fortunes to that
so<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.650> G<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> again<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.400> 31<00:01:23.850> count<00:01:24.090> 3<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so the G and again that's 31 count 3 so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:53.450 
so the G and again that's 31 count 3 so
3<00:01:25.350> 1<00:01:32.270> next<00:01:33.270> section<00:01:51.530> all<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.680> put<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.280> 4

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
3 1 next section all right put some 4

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.090 
3 1 next section all right put some 4
times<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> before<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> key<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.780> G<00:01:55.100> make

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
times with that before the key of G make

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
times with that before the key of G make
sense<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.550> we<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.820> start<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.780> G

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
sense that we would start with a a G

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.040 
sense that we would start with a a G
triad<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.940> songs<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.660> start<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
triad not all songs have to start that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.780 
triad not all songs have to start that
way<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.410> most<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.580> call<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
way but most do with what we call the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:16.290 
way but most do with what we call the
tonic<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:04.560> key<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.920> were<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.820 

and<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:17.480> while<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.170> happening<00:02:18.380> here

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and then while this is happening here

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.540 
and then while this is happening here
we're<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.010> going<00:02:19.250> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
we're just going to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.020 
we're just going to
let<00:02:21.120> those<00:02:21.330> notes<00:02:21.810> flow<00:02:22.650> by<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.730> doing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
let those notes flow by not doing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030 
let those notes flow by not doing
anything<00:02:24.240> or<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.500> holding<00:02:25.830> on
