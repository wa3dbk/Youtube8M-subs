 I am tripoli marcedes in this video here 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 I'm going to introduce you to a new 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 compilation that leaked on the web today that is the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.820
 bill of 10,056 is reminding that these 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.809
 bill says they leak through the web usually 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 are not builds that microsoft 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.739
 officially available through 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 windows and know program then you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.140
 will find the iso to download only 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.000
 sharing sites there. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.820
 files thing like I can not 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 inform is the links for questions there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.070
 copyright and also not to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 run the risk of the channel and the site being 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.739
 prejudice or have the content and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 compromised because of that, then I 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.320
 I downloaded the install on my machine in 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 internet is you guys will see some sites 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 commenting there that also leaked on the web 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.630
 this compilation everything then the internet there 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.200
 this information is already running and are the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 installation iso then it's all up here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 some things that have changed tac or 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 presents you here well 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.430
 Fast are not many things I go 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.490
 start here showing start button 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:40.700
 clicking on it here something that came back 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.700
 this adjustment here is height and width 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.560
 so now I have around here 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.530
 adjust after expanding my button here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 start the way I see fit 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 also have the option to put it in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 full screen does not return here so that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 I was just here for ourselves and compare with 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.550
 compilation 10.041 which was the last 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.039
 compilation that microsoft 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.900
 officially released I have 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.840
 this other compilation on another machine 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.209
 Ok, then I'll open it sooner rather than later. 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 show you here in the right corner 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.860
 lower the bild 1056 or if I come here 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.720
 they did not ram in egypt or v 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.560
 He brings me here too. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.980
 compilation 10.056 now I'll open the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.200
 machine with compilation 10.041 only to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 show this button question here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.019
 start of height and width adjustment 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:49.209
 that I did not have in that build and now 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.959
 already returned here in 10,056 with this 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.060
 machine that windows 10 with bill of 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.180
 1049 I do not remember 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.739
 I do not remember if I talked to you 1051 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.230
 If I told you, sp you have one I said 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.019
 The wrong way is the comparison that 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.510
 I'm going to do it here with build 10 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.730
 thousand and 49 which is the last call that the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.609
 microsoft has made available 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.079
 official for windows server pro rock only 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.010
 to show you the button here 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.829
 start 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.419
 it does not have the option for you to adjust the 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.150
 height and width 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.919
 you only have the option of full screen ta 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 Another important detail is that in 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.010
 build 2049 note where this button 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.010
 power here on top 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.079
 I'm with him here on the right side of the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.900
 start button is located here. 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.629
 power button next to the expand part 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.139
 the start button now I'm going back there in 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.739
 build 10.056 that this button 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:51.099
 power changed place and enjoy also 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.729
 to highlight this icon here from the test 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.609
 who saw the task display opens a 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:00.639
 window here just so the option you 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.269
 have to create multiple desktops 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.519
 where this icon is then 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.229
 here too has changed I will minimize 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:15.370
 here to open the 10,056 compilation here 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:18.280
 on 10.056 the power button here on the side 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 then left're what I have the option 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.900
 to start doing it koff is 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.200
 showing up here for me because I'm 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.880
 remotely so easy remote connection 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.130
 here depending on the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.200
 are I take him he does not give me the option of 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.660
 off then you will have the option 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.660
 shutdown and restart log off 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.570
 and other details here I commented on the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.780
 test I saw on then I got that button 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.890
 of the test you saw with the different icon 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:52.090
 it's another change the trash icon 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.270
 which is one of the items there that many 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.780
 people commented is the new icon that 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.390
 was in the 2049 build 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.560
 it was also changed in this compilation 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.740
 of the 1,056 team back here by one by one 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.090
 retro mode much more like the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.300
 windows xp is than some any other more 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.210
 then they also changed. 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.210
 icon will now compare to what is 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:29.020
 there in build 2049 close an icon 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.600
 quite different, it is clear that along with 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.890
 these changes comes a packet of 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.140
 also fixes some bugs that 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.660
 were present in the combinations 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.360
 previous is so I put it on 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.150
 description of the video a link to my 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.370
 site and within that link has an image 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.870
 with a list of bugs that were 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:56.110
 corrected in this compilation 10.056 ok I 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.230
 I'm here on the 2049 build machine 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.720
 close the video only as closed 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.440
 nanÃ¡ machine with the compilation of 1,056 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.450
 Come on, okay, come back here then. 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.220
 although it is a very short content 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.370
 This video is more for us. 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.530
 monitor these developments in the 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.810
 windows 10 builds and see what 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.280
 changed that has not changed which is to clear the 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.650
 everyone's participation is very 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.470
 important in the construction and 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.750
 development of this then 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.550
 That's why Microsoft will release 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.040
 quite the issue of windows and sider 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.040
 program the windows feedback application 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.260
 for you to participate commenting on 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.010
 the new compilations reporting some 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.820
 bugs and incompatibilities with some 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.250
 devices 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.830
 suggest some new tool some 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.660
 tool that was discontinued 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.350
 You used to use it so it's 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.860
 important that instead of criticizing 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.410
 forum comments or 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.350
 even here in the description, right? 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.990
 videos in the comments then it is very 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.300
 more productive you contribute your 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.220
 comment with your review using 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.800
 there the means of communication that 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.380
 microsoft owns that we realize that 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.230
 this means of communication it really 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.020
 is working more effectively 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.780
 now with windows 10 beta easier 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.090
 to get there and share it 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.090
 do you think of a certain product 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.040
 It's one more recommendation that I always 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.950
 I'll record with a video of a 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.200
 compilation is that it was not distributed 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.080
 official way by microsoft is that 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.180
 you do not install it on a physical machine 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.400
 always try to install in machine 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.170
 virtual case that some kind of 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.510
 problem you do not compromise the 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.280
 operation of your machine and also the 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.200
 data from your computer ok 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.350
 The good thing about this video here is just what I 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.390
 I wanted to show you compilation 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.890
 10.056 from windows 10 any other 

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.400
 I'm sharing this novelty with 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.200
 Thank you so much until the next video. 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.690
 I want to thank you for seeing 

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.720
 but this video share on the screen with 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:09.140

 accessing the channel geo tv the site ms week 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.430
 I hope to continue contributing and 

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.060
 sharing knowledge is with you 

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.780
