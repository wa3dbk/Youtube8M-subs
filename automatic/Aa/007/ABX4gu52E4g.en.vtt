but is not discouraging mack brown I
thought<00:00:12.210> they<00:00:12.360> both<00:00:12.509> did<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.780> good<00:00:12.929> job<00:00:13.130> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
thought they both did a good job and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.169 
thought they both did a good job and
that's<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.370> good<00:00:14.519> thing<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.820> think<00:00:14.910> we're<00:00:15.089> going

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
that's a good thing I think we're going

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.700 
that's a good thing I think we're going
to<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.330> two<00:00:15.599> good<00:00:15.780> quarterbacks<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.529> play

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
to have two good quarterbacks to play

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.519 
to have two good quarterbacks to play
right<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.109> we'll<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
right now and and we'll just have to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
right now and and we'll just have to
figure<00:00:19.650> all<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.550> go<00:00:20.580> through

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
figure all that out as we go through

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.640 
figure all that out as we go through
still<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.600> half<00:00:21.750> weeks<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.560> uh

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
still got to two half weeks but it's uh

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640 
still got to two half weeks but it's uh
it's<00:00:23.070> not<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.240> last<00:00:24.539> year<00:00:24.750> most<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
it's not like it was last year most of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.839 
it's not like it was last year most of
the<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.490> haven't<00:00:26.730> had<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the time around here we haven't had a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730 
the time around here we haven't had a
backup<00:00:27.060> quarterback<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.779> could<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
backup quarterback that could go in and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.429 
backup quarterback that could go in and
win<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:31.019> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
win and right now is the first time that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
win and right now is the first time that
I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> best<00:00:32.730> shape<00:00:32.850> we're

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I think we're in the best shape we're

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
I think we're in the best shape we're
not<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> best<00:00:34.079> shape<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> starter

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
not in the best shape with a starter

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
not in the best shape with a starter
because<00:00:35.760> we've<00:00:36.000> had<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.750> Americans<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because we've had all Americans at that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.400 
because we've had all Americans at that
position<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.420> both<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> those<00:00:39.750> guys<00:00:39.989> give<00:00:40.290> us

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
position but both of those guys give us

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660 
position but both of those guys give us
a<00:00:40.530> chance<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> win<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.550> they

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
a chance to win right now if they

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.979 
a chance to win right now if they
protect<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> ball<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.480> both<00:00:42.600> did<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
protect the ball and they both did that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
protect the ball and they both did that
last<00:00:43.200> night<00:00:43.440> Case<00:00:43.980> McCoy<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> David<00:00:44.820> Ash<00:00:44.969> have

last night Case McCoy and David Ash have

last night Case McCoy and David Ash have
said<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.750> grown<00:00:46.050> compared<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> last

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

had<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> say<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> protect<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> ball

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
had to say you got to protect the ball

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
had to say you got to protect the ball
you<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.539> some<00:00:51.719> explosives<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> got

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to score in the red zone but that is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
to score in the red zone but that is
happening<00:00:55.170> naturally<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.879> just

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
happening naturally if you're just

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
happening naturally if you're just
managing<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> game<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.680> David's<00:00:59.129> done<00:00:59.430> a

if he would change his decision to not

if he would change his decision to not
named<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> starter<00:01:10.770> after<00:01:11.159> 2011<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.450> had<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
named the starter after 2011 we had to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
named the starter after 2011 we had to
do<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.110> again<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> same<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
do over again we do the same thing and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.990 
do over again we do the same thing and
and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> reason<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:17.460> helped<00:01:17.880> our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and the reason is it's a it helped our

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
and the reason is it's a it helped our
football<00:01:18.270> team<00:01:18.479> over<00:01:19.020> summer<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
football team over summer I think the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.770 
football team over summer I think the
young<00:01:20.670> receivers<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.390> further<00:01:21.600> along

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
young receivers are further along

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
young receivers are further along
because<00:01:22.140> both<00:01:22.470> quarterbacks<00:01:22.860> were<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.310> there

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
because both quarterbacks were out there

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.359 
because both quarterbacks were out there
competing<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.229> teaching<00:01:25.229> those<00:01:25.409> guys<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
competing and teaching those guys and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.460 
competing and teaching those guys and
the<00:01:27.000> timing<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> passing<00:01:28.140> game<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the timing and the passing game is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
the timing and the passing game is
better<00:01:28.650> than<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.430> left<00:01:29.520> spring

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
better than it was when we left spring

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
better than it was when we left spring
practice<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> both<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> guys<00:01:32.040> still<00:01:32.400> have

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
practice and both of the guys still have

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
practice and both of the guys still have
some<00:01:32.820> hope<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.299> still<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> chance

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
some hope and they still have a chance

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
some hope and they still have a chance
and<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.549> times

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and I do think there there will be times

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
and I do think there there will be times
this<00:01:36.030> year<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.360> play<00:01:36.540> both<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> them

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this year will play both of them

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
this year will play both of them
regardless<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.040> separate<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> like

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
regardless of how we separate it like

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
regardless of how we separate it like
don't<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> will<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.770> last<00:01:41.040> year<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
don't think it will be like last year it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420 
don't think it will be like last year it
won't<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> last<00:01:43.020> guy<00:01:43.710> standing<00:01:43.979> type

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
won't be the last guy standing type

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
won't be the last guy standing type
thing<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
thing but I do think that there will be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960 
thing but I do think that there will be
times<00:01:46.590> where<00:01:46.890> both<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> them<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.549> help<00:01:47.729> us<00:01:47.850> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
times where both of them can help us in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.910 
times where both of them can help us in
a<00:01:48.030> ball<00:01:48.210> game<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> who<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.500> now

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a ball game we know who we are right now

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.260 
a ball game we know who we are right now
we<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.060> better

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
we know what we need to do to get better

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.590

out<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.569> tie

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
out with the tie

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.210 
out with the tie
we<00:02:13.570> drop<00:02:13.810> passes<00:02:14.290> at<00:02:14.440> tight<00:02:14.620> end<00:02:14.650> last<00:02:15.040> night

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.010 
we drop passes at tight end last night
and<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.030> thought<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.330> blocked<00:02:16.570> better<00:02:16.810> than

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
and and I thought we blocked better than

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.300 
and and I thought we blocked better than
we<00:02:17.140> caught<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.450> dropped<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:21.010> probably

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
we caught but we we dropped we probably

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.550 
we caught but we we dropped we probably
dropped<00:02:21.640> five<00:02:21.880> passes<00:02:22.450> overall<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.200> tight<00:02:23.410> in

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
dropped five passes overall it tight in

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.240 
dropped five passes overall it tight in
last<00:02:23.830> night<00:02:24.040> next<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.270> wide<00:02:25.480> receivers

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
last night next up the wide receivers

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.800 
last night next up the wide receivers
we've<00:02:27.250> got<00:02:27.460> more<00:02:27.640> speed<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:28.360> talent

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
there than we've had the last couple of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.100 
there than we've had the last couple of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.860 
years but again we're we're not getting
the<00:02:35.260> continuity<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.180> would<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:37.570> yet

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870

we've been really good around here we've

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
had a lot of depth and we haven't had a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.010 
had a lot of depth and we haven't had a

guy get hurt yet that won't play in a
game<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:52.420> we<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:52.930> also<00:03:53.110> feel<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:55.200> where

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
game but we we also feel like that where

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.840 
game but we we also feel like that where
we're<00:03:56.500> not<00:03:56.530> near<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:57.250> good<00:03:57.310> when<00:03:57.730> we

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
we're not near as good when we

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.130 
we're not near as good when we
substitute<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.660> heat<00:03:58.810> you're<00:03:58.960> going<00:03:59.080> to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
substitute and the heat you're going to

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.810 
substitute and the heat you're going to
have<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.320> substitute<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.220> we've<00:04:00.370> got<00:04:00.580> we've

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
have to substitute so we've got we've

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.100 
have to substitute so we've got we've
got<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.360> have<00:04:01.510> some<00:04:01.780> guys<00:04:02.020> step<00:04:02.560> up<00:04:03.630> at<00:04:04.630> nearly

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
got to have some guys step up at nearly

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.770 
got to have some guys step up at nearly
all<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.560> positions<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:07.030> we<00:04:07.420> think<00:04:07.540> they're

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
all the positions and we think they're

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.870 
all the positions and we think they're
good<00:04:08.260> players<00:04:08.500> but<00:04:08.740> then<00:04:09.070> we<00:04:09.310> have<00:04:09.460> a<00:04:09.490> drop-off

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
good players but then we have a drop-off

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.240 
good players but then we have a drop-off
and<00:04:10.390> that's<00:04:10.990> that's<00:04:11.230> an<00:04:11.440> area<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.740> really

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and that's that's an area that really

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.250 
and that's that's an area that really
concerns<00:04:12.790> us<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> final<00:04:13.780> question

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
concerns us so the final question

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.500 
concerns us so the final question
remains<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.250> team<00:04:15.520> where<00:04:15.730> Mac<00:04:15.910> expected

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
remains is this team where Mac expected

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.060 
remains is this team where Mac expected
it<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.720> be<00:04:16.750> at<00:04:17.080> this<00:04:17.320> point<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:17.710> fall<00:04:17.859> camp

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it to be at this point of fall camp

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.010 
it to be at this point of fall camp
there<00:04:18.370> never<00:04:18.580> were<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.120> want<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.540> be<00:04:19.690> or<00:04:19.840> hope

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
there never were you want to be or hope

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.620 
there never were you want to be or hope
they're<00:04:20.200> going<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.440> be<00:04:20.590> because<00:04:20.770> you<00:04:20.979> always

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
they're going to be because you always

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.290 
they're going to be because you always
have<00:04:22.630> expectations<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.740> are<00:04:23.919> higher<00:04:24.220> than

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
have expectations that are higher than

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.280 
have expectations that are higher than
what<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.479> can<00:04:25.660> do<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
what you can do and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.010 
what you can do and
13<00:04:27.010> practices<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.820> we've<00:04:28.120> made<00:04:28.360> progress<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
13 practices and we've made progress I

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.110 
13 practices and we've made progress I
like<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.350> fact<00:04:29.500> they're<00:04:29.770> trying<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.970> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
like the fact they're trying I like the

like the fact they're trying I like the
fact<00:04:31.270> they're<00:04:31.510> in<00:04:31.600> good<00:04:31.720> shape<00:04:31.780> we're<00:04:32.380> going

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.170 
fact they're in good shape we're going
to<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.980> more<00:04:33.190> depth<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:33.760> we've<00:04:33.910> got<00:04:34.060> to

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
to have more depth but we've got to

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.760 
to have more depth but we've got to
develop<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.840> that's<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.410> told<00:04:35.650> our

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
develop it and that's and I told our

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.380 
develop it and that's and I told our
coaches<00:04:36.130> today<00:04:36.160> we<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.790> have<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.940> good<00:04:37.180> team
