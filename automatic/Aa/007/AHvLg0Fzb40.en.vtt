hey<00:00:05.700> everybody<00:00:06.089> its<00:00:06.270> Jason<00:00:06.629> Blaha<00:00:06.870> here<00:00:07.170> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.480 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and
one<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.799> questions<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.189> comes<00:00:08.370> up

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
one of the questions that comes up

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.980 
one of the questions that comes up
frequently<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.330> lot<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.570> confusion

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
frequently and it's a lot of confusion

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.360 
frequently and it's a lot of confusion
on<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.200> because<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> popular<00:00:11.010> routines

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
on this because of the popular routines

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.259 
on this because of the popular routines
and<00:00:11.550> things<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.910> out<00:00:12.000> there<00:00:12.150> by

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and things that are out there by

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
and things that are out there by
bodybuilders<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:12.990> fitness<00:00:13.320> models<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.309> some

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
bodybuilders and fitness models and some

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.970 
bodybuilders and fitness models and some
athletes<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:16.139> gives<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.500> more<00:00:16.710> gains

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
athletes is what gives you more gains

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070 
athletes is what gives you more gains
high<00:00:17.190> frequency<00:00:17.910> meaning<00:00:18.600> training<00:00:18.990> more

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
high frequency meaning training more

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
high frequency meaning training more
often<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.680> high<00:00:19.920> volume<00:00:20.189> training<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> lot

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
often or high volume training with a lot

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.230 
often or high volume training with a lot
more<00:00:21.650> total<00:00:22.650> sets<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> work<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:23.789> workout

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
more total sets and work and one workout

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
more total sets and work and one workout
and<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.289> answer<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:25.949> both<00:00:26.340> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and the answer is actually both it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
and the answer is actually both it
depends<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> context<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.080> put

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
depends on the context in which you put

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
depends on the context in which you put
them<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.769> by<00:00:29.189> gains<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> mean<00:00:29.820> both<00:00:30.000> size<00:00:30.300> or

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
them and by gains I mean both size or

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
them and by gains I mean both size or
strength<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> main<00:00:32.460> difference<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
strength but the main difference is that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
strength but the main difference is that
when<00:00:33.239> people<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.600> drug-free<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.620> they're<00:00:34.829> on

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
when people are drug-free or they're on

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
when people are drug-free or they're on
fairly<00:00:35.430> conservative<00:00:36.210> amounts<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> anabolic

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
fairly conservative amounts of anabolic

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.500 
fairly conservative amounts of anabolic
drugs<00:00:37.440> generally<00:00:38.250> higher<00:00:38.700> frequency<00:00:39.329> has

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
drugs generally higher frequency has

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
drugs generally higher frequency has
been<00:00:39.719> found<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.320> produce<00:00:40.500> better<00:00:41.460> results

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
been found to produce better results

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
been found to produce better results
better<00:00:42.300> gains<00:00:42.600> then<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:43.590> higher<00:00:43.770> volume

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
better gains then doing higher volume

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.920 
better gains then doing higher volume
for<00:00:44.460> example<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> were<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.660> nine

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
for example if you were going to do nine

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
for example if you were going to do nine
sets<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> given<00:00:46.920> exercise<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.670> body<00:00:47.879> part

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
sets for a given exercise or body part

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.090 
sets for a given exercise or body part
if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> did<00:00:48.690> three<00:00:48.930> sets<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> those<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.739> Monday

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
if you did three sets of those on Monday

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
if you did three sets of those on Monday
Wednesday<00:00:50.309> Friday<00:00:50.820> instead<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> doing<00:00:52.140> nine

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
Wednesday Friday instead of doing nine

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
Wednesday Friday instead of doing nine
total<00:00:52.800> sets<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.579> Monday<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
total sets on just Monday and then

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
total sets on just Monday and then
waiting<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> week<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> repeat<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.289> again<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
waiting a week to repeat it again you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
waiting a week to repeat it again you
will<00:00:55.890> generally<00:00:56.370> make<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:57.050> progress<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
will generally make more progress on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740 
will generally make more progress on
both<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.620> exercise<00:00:59.160> and<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.270> terms<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
both that exercise and in terms of the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.650 
both that exercise and in terms of the
size<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> gain<00:01:01.559> however<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.579> drug<00:01:03.239> doses

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
size that you gain however as drug doses

size that you gain however as drug doses
start<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> find<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
start to go up what you find it the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
start to go up what you find it the
diminished<00:01:06.000> returns<00:01:06.180> from<00:01:06.689> training<00:01:07.170> volume

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
diminished returns from training volume

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
diminished returns from training volume
seem<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> reduced<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.549> people<00:01:08.760> start

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
seem to be reduced so when people start

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
seem to be reduced so when people start
going<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.240> very<00:01:09.450> large<00:01:09.689> amounts<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> anabolic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
going on very large amounts of anabolic

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
going on very large amounts of anabolic
drugs<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.310> tremendous<00:01:12.060> amounts

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
drugs they can make tremendous amounts

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
drugs they can make tremendous amounts
of<00:01:12.659> gains<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> single<00:01:14.010> workout<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.000> they

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of gains off of a single workout so they

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969 
of gains off of a single workout so they
can<00:01:15.420> train<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:16.170> hour<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.590> hours

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
can train for an hour or two hours

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
can train for an hour or two hours
straight<00:01:17.189> beating<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> same<00:01:18.090> exercise

adapt to it make progress from it and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
adapt to it make progress from it and
because<00:01:23.130> they're<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> anabolic

trained and it stays that way for

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
trained and it stays that way for
anywhere<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:34.079> 24<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:35.100> 48

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
anywhere from about 24 up to about 48
hours<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> returns<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.110> to

hours and then it returns back to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
hours and then it returns back to
baseline<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.829> stopped<00:01:38.130> making<00:01:38.280> gains

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
baseline and you stopped making gains

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
baseline and you stopped making gains
and<00:01:38.880> growing<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> how<00:01:39.869> every<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and growing from it how every one all

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.600 
and growing from it how every one all
these<00:01:40.380> drugs<00:01:40.619> come<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> mix<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> could

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
these drugs come into the mix it could

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.010 
these drugs come into the mix it could
last<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> week<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.780> guys<00:01:42.960> are

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
last for up to a week so these guys are

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
last for up to a week so these guys are
able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> come<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.740> train<00:01:44.430> harder<00:01:45.030> train

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
able to come in train harder train

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
able to come in train harder train
longer<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:46.890> grow<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
longer and then grow from that for a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
longer and then grow from that for a
longer<00:01:48.000> period<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.390> time<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.960> answer<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
longer period of time so the answer to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
longer period of time so the answer to
it<00:01:49.740> actually<00:01:49.979> depends<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.610> many<00:01:50.670> drugs

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it actually depends on how many drugs

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.580 
it actually depends on how many drugs
people<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.540> taking<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.960> far<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.380> one's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
people are taking as far as which one's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830 
people are taking as far as which one's
going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> give<00:01:52.890> them<00:01:53.040> better<00:01:53.310> progress<00:01:54.149> but

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
going to give them better progress but

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.910 
going to give them better progress but
remember<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:55.439> talking<00:01:55.560> better

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
remember when we're talking better

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
remember when we're talking better
progress<00:01:56.189> we're<00:01:56.460> talking<00:01:56.759> tit<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.119> tat<00:01:57.270> we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
progress we're talking tit for tat we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.200 
progress we're talking tit for tat we
might<00:01:57.600> only<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.930> talking<00:01:58.229> 10%<00:01:58.829> or<00:01:58.979> 20%<00:01:59.219> better

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
might only be talking 10% or 20% better

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
might only be talking 10% or 20% better
results<00:02:00.810> over<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> period<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.469> time<00:02:01.649> doing<00:02:01.920> one

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
results over a period of time doing one

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.870 
results over a period of time doing one
versus<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> other

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
versus the other

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
versus the other
so<00:02:03.360> remember<00:02:03.810> any<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> train<00:02:04.710> hard<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so remember any time you train hard and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
so remember any time you train hard and
train<00:02:05.490> intelligently<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.540> always<00:02:06.750> going

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
train intelligently you're always going

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
train intelligently you're always going
to<00:02:07.320> make<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:08.399> progress<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.780> matter
