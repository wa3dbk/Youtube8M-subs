How to sew a jinbei collar

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.279
Here is a way of sewing a collar for 
 this kind of a piece of clothing.

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.515
It’s the pink part of the drawing.

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:10.258
Fold the allowance seam of the collar

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:12.196
Then fold it in half.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.602
Iron the edges to make it flat.

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:19.147
Open to start sewing. 

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:23.927
To do so, we will insert a folded white piece 
 of fabric half the width of external fabric.

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.409
Mark the middle of 
white part with a 
 clip 
(as seen on the external fabric)

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:35.025
Match the clips.

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:47.493
Staystitch on seam allowance.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.010
Make clips on back neck line

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:10.322
As it difficult to deal with corner curves…

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.367
… cut 9 mm long clips on the seam allowance.

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:23.526
Repeat it on the opposite side

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:36.896
Put the middle mark of the collar and the back seam together.

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:47.260
Lay collar stitch on outside back fabric.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.770
Start sewing while making sure to align opposite fabrics on the right side. 

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.300
Turn clip cut part to create a straight line of fabric.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.220
Be careful not to sew other parts of fabric because of folds

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.720
Sew very carefully. 

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.530
Don’t forget back stitching !

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:56.880
We’ve done one side

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:06.380
Sew the opposite part collar down.

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.500
Make the neckline straight again.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.620
The collar is now fixed.

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:39.900
Let’s sew the tip of the collar

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:44.420
Cut the extra fabric.

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:47.120
Let  a 1 cm seam allowance.

00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:00.590
Here is what the collar folding must look like. 

00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:05.770
Reverse fold the tip and sew.

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.140
Pinch and push the extra fabric inside.

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:38.330
Fold the seam allowance inside the collar.

00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:46.620
Sew the other tip of the collar the same way.

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:55.850
Cut the extra fabric and let a 1cm seam allowance.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:04.140
Reverse fold the tip and sew

00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.770
Place pins to prevent collar back from moving.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.050
Pinning done ! 

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:50.500
Close it by handsewing or with a sewing machine, as you like.

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:56.050
If you chose handsewing, start sewing after hiding the knot inside

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.440
Stitch in 1-2 threads of fiber .

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:09.480
Make regular stitches of about 0.5-1cm width.

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:26.700
If you chose the sewing machine, baste the collar first.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.350
Start sewing 2-5 mm from the edge while being 
 careful not to sew above basting thread. 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.840
Pull the basting thread. You finished sewing the collar!
