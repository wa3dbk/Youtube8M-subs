00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930 
headshots per game and because you'll
have<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.709> class<00:02:58.980> made<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.489> free<00:02:59.670> for<00:02:59.880> all

have a class made for free for all

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.390 
have a class made for free for all
you'll<00:03:00.360> be<00:03:00.510> faster<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.080> quick<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.860> aiming<00:03:02.190> at

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
you'll be faster and quick at aiming at

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280 
you'll be faster and quick at aiming at
the<00:03:02.519> heads<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> lot<00:03:04.080> of

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the heads now because there are a lot of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.840 
the heads now because there are a lot of
guns<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.650> need<00:03:04.950> headshots<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.580> unlock

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
guns that need headshots to unlock

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.460 
guns that need headshots to unlock
diamond<00:03:06.300> there<00:03:06.750> are<00:03:06.870> certain<00:03:07.200> things<00:03:07.230> that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
diamond there are certain things that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.990 
diamond there are certain things that
you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.160> make<00:03:08.340> sure<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.730> get<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
you can do to make sure that you get the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.720 
you can do to make sure that you get the
most<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.870> each<00:03:10.140> gun<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.220> submachine

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
most with each gun so for the submachine

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
most with each gun so for the submachine
guns<00:03:12.030> make<00:03:12.630> sure<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.930> always<00:03:13.110> aim<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
guns make sure to always aim for the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.890 
guns make sure to always aim for the
chest<00:03:13.980> once<00:03:14.280> you're<00:03:14.489> close<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:15.569> keep<00:03:15.780> on

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
chest once you're close and then keep on

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.340 
chest once you're close and then keep on
shooting

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
shooting

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.870 
shooting
and<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.890> works<00:03:17.100> really<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
and this works really well for the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880 
and this works really well for the
headshots<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> recoil<00:03:19.230> will<00:03:19.680> make

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
headshots because the recoil will make

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.830 
headshots because the recoil will make
sure<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.310> end<00:03:20.549> up<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.940> headshot<00:03:21.390> but

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
sure that you end up with a headshot but

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.270 
sure that you end up with a headshot but
it's<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.290> important<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.040> get<00:03:23.160> as

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
it's really important that you get as

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819 
it's really important that you get as
close<00:03:23.519> as<00:03:23.579> possible<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:24.630> over<00:03:25.049> range<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
close as possible because over range the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.440 
close as possible because over range the
headshots<00:03:26.250> will<00:03:26.459> become<00:03:26.760> much<00:03:27.000> harder<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
headshots will become much harder to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.690 
headshots will become much harder to
guess<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:28.170> for<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.380> assault<00:03:28.739> rifles<00:03:29.190> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
guess now for the assault rifles you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.250 
guess now for the assault rifles you
want<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.209> same<00:03:30.480> thing<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:30.930> with<00:03:31.110> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
want to do the same thing as with the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.289 
want to do the same thing as with the
submachine<00:03:31.739> guns<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.579> because<00:03:32.910> these<00:03:33.090> have

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
submachine guns but because these have

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.240 
submachine guns but because these have
better<00:03:33.510> range<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:34.170> you're<00:03:34.590> further<00:03:34.829> away<00:03:35.220> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
better range if you're further away you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.250 
better range if you're further away you
can<00:03:35.579> tap<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.030> trigger<00:03:36.329> whilst<00:03:36.570> aiming<00:03:36.840> for

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
can tap the trigger whilst aiming for

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.080 
can tap the trigger whilst aiming for
the<00:03:37.350> head<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.709> you'll<00:03:38.250> still<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.670> able<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.910> get

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the head and you'll still be able to get

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.180 
the head and you'll still be able to get
the<00:03:39.180> headshot<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.350> also<00:03:40.620> works<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
the headshot and this also works for the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.890 
the headshot and this also works for the
light<00:03:41.340> machineguns<00:03:41.880> as<00:03:42.030> well<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.750> because

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
light machineguns as well but because

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.140 
light machineguns as well but because
these<00:03:43.260> have<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> higher<00:03:43.680> recoil<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:44.940> sure

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
these have a higher recoil make sure

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.729 
these have a higher recoil make sure
that<00:03:45.269> once<00:03:45.450> you've<00:03:45.600> got<00:03:45.780> close<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.260> target

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
that once you've got close to a target

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.099 
that once you've got close to a target
that<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.190> keep<00:03:47.579> on<00:03:47.790> shooting<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.870> works

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
that you keep on shooting and this works

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.660 
that you keep on shooting and this works
well<00:03:49.230> since<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.709> light<00:03:49.829> machine<00:03:50.010> guns<00:03:50.310> always

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
well since the light machine guns always

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.670 
well since the light machine guns always
have<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.850> big<00:03:51.090> clip<00:03:51.329> size<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.140> you'll<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.560> run

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
have a big clip size so you'll not run

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.020 
have a big clip size so you'll not run
out<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.829> bullets<00:03:53.040> when<00:03:53.280> you're<00:03:53.489> doing<00:03:53.880> this

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
out of bullets when you're doing this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.000 
out of bullets when you're doing this
now<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.570> big<00:03:54.870> difference<00:03:54.900> comes<00:03:55.530> when<00:03:55.680> you're

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
now the big difference comes when you're

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
now the big difference comes when you're
doing<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> pistols<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.000> you're<00:03:57.390> trying<00:03:57.690> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
doing the pistols and you're trying to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.840 
doing the pistols and you're trying to
get<00:03:57.900> headshots<00:03:58.170> with<00:03:58.410> them<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.609> most

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
get headshots with them so for the most

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.940 
get headshots with them so for the most
part<00:04:00.030> shoot<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> target<00:04:01.260> once<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> body

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
part shoot the target once in the body

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.250 
part shoot the target once in the body
and<00:04:02.190> then<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:02.940> for<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.209> head<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:04.200> is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
and then in for the head and this is

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.810 
and then in for the head and this is
because<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.769> first<00:04:05.010> shot<00:04:05.310> will<00:04:05.459> weaken<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
because that first shot will weaken the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.550 
because that first shot will weaken the
target<00:04:06.239> which<00:04:06.630> means<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.140> only<00:04:07.170> need

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
target which means that you only need

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
target which means that you only need
one<00:04:07.829> shot<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.190> be<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.489> head<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.880> order<00:04:09.329> to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
one shot to be in the head in order to

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.750 
one shot to be in the head in order to
get<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.810> headshot<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:10.980> works<00:04:11.190> well<00:04:11.519> for

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
get the headshot now this works well for

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.000 
get the headshot now this works well for
most<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.120> them<00:04:12.239> apart<00:04:12.930> from<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.260> executioner

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
most of them apart from the executioner

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
most of them apart from the executioner
now<00:04:14.519> this<00:04:14.700> gun<00:04:14.820> is<00:04:14.940> by<00:04:15.090> far<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.420> hardest<00:04:15.720> going

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
now this gun is by far the hardest going

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.110 
now this gun is by far the hardest going
to<00:04:16.109> get<00:04:16.289> headshots<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.919> since<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.609> range<00:04:17.880> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
to get headshots with since the range is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.479 
to get headshots with since the range is
really<00:04:18.150> bad<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.410> get<00:04:19.650> headshots<00:04:19.919> with<00:04:20.220> this

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
really bad so to get headshots with this

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.730 
really bad so to get headshots with this
always<00:04:21.269> within<00:04:21.570> buildings<00:04:21.780> or<00:04:22.229> be<00:04:22.380> around

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
always within buildings or be around

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.440 
always within buildings or be around
them<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.370> your<00:04:23.669> targets<00:04:24.120> are<00:04:24.210> really
