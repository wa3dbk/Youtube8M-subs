00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
pack and that's why you see a lot of the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.910 
pack and that's why you see a lot of the
guys<00:01:04.360> losing<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:05.019> lot<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.229> their<00:01:05.470> front<00:01:05.680> ends

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
guys losing a lot of their front ends

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.070 
guys losing a lot of their front ends
and<00:01:06.310> it's<00:01:06.430> very<00:01:06.729> hard<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.360> pick<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.780> tire

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
and it's very hard to pick a tire

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.230 
and it's very hard to pick a tire
because<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:09.070> got<00:01:09.220> some<00:01:09.400> sand<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.000> track

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
because you got some sand in the track

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.750 
because you got some sand in the track
also<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.440> know<00:01:11.590> what<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:12.280> hard<00:01:12.550> pack

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
also and you know what the hard pack

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.340 
also and you know what the hard pack
tire<00:01:13.030> does<00:01:13.270> not<00:01:13.450> work<00:01:13.690> in<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.960> sand<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
tire does not work in the sand and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.630 
tire does not work in the sand and
that's<00:01:14.590> why<00:01:14.800> it's<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.040> little<00:01:15.250> bit<00:01:15.340> treacherous

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
that's why it's a little bit treacherous

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's why it's a little bit treacherous
