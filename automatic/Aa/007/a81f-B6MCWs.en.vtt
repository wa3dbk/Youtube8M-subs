helicopter as you can see the radio

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 
helicopter as you can see the radio
transmitter<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.690> quite<00:00:18.960> big<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.619> quite<00:00:19.800> huge

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
transmitter is quite big it's quite huge

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.320 
transmitter is quite big it's quite huge
it's<00:00:21.060> later<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.600> properly<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.910> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.090> the

it's later very properly and this is the
norm<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:25.279> increasing<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> acceleration<00:00:27.119> or

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
norm for increasing the acceleration or

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.240 
norm for increasing the acceleration or
in<00:00:27.630> technical<00:00:28.050> terms<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.320> call<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:29.039> the

part of the wings and this is a for this
is<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> total<00:00:35.250> turn<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.610> left<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.860> up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is like a total turn out left right up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
is like a total turn out left right up
down<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
down you all all that all that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
down you all all that all that
again<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> thing<00:00:42.870> right

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
again you see this way this thing right

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.610 
again you see this way this thing right
here<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.789> knob<00:00:45.270> slob<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.350> used

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
here this one is this knob slob is used

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.430 
here this one is this knob slob is used
for<00:00:47.039> balancing<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.149> helicopter<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
for balancing the helicopter think of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
for balancing the helicopter think of
when<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> used<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> punch<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> then

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
when you used to punch it up and then

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
when you used to punch it up and then
copters<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> shaking<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
copters kind of shaking up a bit and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
copters kind of shaking up a bit and
it's<00:00:54.180> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> revolving<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it's kind of revolving all that so you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's kind of revolving all that so you
can<00:00:56.160> use<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.879> set<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can use this to set it all right and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
can use this to set it all right and
I'll<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:58.260> care<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> also<00:00:59.579> see

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I'll take care of it you can also see

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.599 
I'll take care of it you can also see
this<00:01:00.000> norm<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.930> normal<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:02.309> says

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this norm out and this normal it says

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
this norm out and this normal it says
slow<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> quick<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> big<00:01:04.559> nose<00:01:04.739> look

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
quite durable and they're quite a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.370 
quite durable and they're quite a
flexible<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.860> well<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.599> for<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.660> newcomers<00:02:11.959> by

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
flexible as well so for the newcomers by

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.009 
flexible as well so for the newcomers by
John<00:02:12.620> Spink<00:02:12.980> crashes<00:02:13.540> most<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.810> not

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
John Spink crashes most probably not

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.809 
John Spink crashes most probably not
going<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.170> break<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.650> forever<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.550> first

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
instance because these are quite

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.050 
instance because these are quite
flexible<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:20.750> adapt<00:02:21.380> itself<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.130> as

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
flexible they are adapt itself and as

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.809 
flexible they are adapt itself and as
you<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.470> balance<00:02:25.310> it's

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
you can see this is the balance it's

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.970 
you can see this is the balance it's
going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> help<00:02:26.319> for<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.380> balancing<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> the
