00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.329
 Welcome 

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today we are in faunia knowing the non-installation of mangrove crocodiles 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.169
 who know their animals so get ready 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.169
 we start 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.619
 we are in the sea 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.060
 rotten lark in family with one of the most impressive green species 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.370
 there are currently the nile crocodile as you can see 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 it's about one of the most impressive specimens 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.120
 of the reptiles as they reach up to 5 6 and up to seven meters in length 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.520
 the copies that we are good we are united are examples that live near 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.710
 three and a half meters still have to grow almost twice the size that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.950
 We're seeing 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.370
 these copies 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 that we know of the documentaries await the nines in the passage of the river 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.560
 mara there are able to gobble up prey so large that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.340
 a strong jaw at the bottom of the river 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 they are standing specimens 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.670
 dams by drowning 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.460
 they are taken to the law 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 spinning on themselves tearing the pieces of meat that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 if it is useful, it is a true armored one and it is covered with a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.160
 heap of bony plates that protect this end 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.680
 from the bites of some 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620
 companions because if the time comes 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 in which they must compete for a prey to the watÃ¡n 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.520
 the nile crocodiles are quiet animals usually wait 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 merging with the vegetation on the banks merging with trunks 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.730
 that float adrift to sign up for their prey they usually do it between 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.570
 the mammals that try to cross 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 the mara river 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.060
 on the African continent 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.729
 the females bury their eggs on the shores on beaches and protect the look 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.020
 until the babies come out 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 the first days they spent with their mother and she will move them from 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 the age of the area where they were born Spanish 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.850
 to keep these species in shape we had to create mangroves 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.639
 specific for them 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.859
 in the basin that you are seeing with more than 100 cubic meters of water and the 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.169
 temperature which we find that is what they would find in it they inhabit 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.289
 at 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.129
 about 27 and 28 degrees of temperature sunny beaches like 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.369
 They can heat your body and your blood 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.369
 is what these animals need to 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.439
 they are feeding 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.180
 little by little they will be making a more varied diet in barrel here as a family
