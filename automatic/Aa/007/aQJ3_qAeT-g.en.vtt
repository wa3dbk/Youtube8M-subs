 to allow the installation of 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.109
 applications from other sources than 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.180
 touch devices are data devices 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.400
 are more vulnerable to 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.470
 attacks by application sources 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.810
 unknown to this is an alert that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.189

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:05.519

 apk files run want to install 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:12.530
 this application 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:15.530
 let's go to the next one 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.530
 installing 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.550
 the installed application open obvious that 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.730
 It will not open because I'm not 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.100
 with active cast chrome but the staff 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.680
 Look at this here Oh the chrome cast already 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.570
 installed then that's it 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.310
 when you buy a croquette 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.290
 especially here in Brazil that does not 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.920
 you still have google support you can 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.300
 you can look for this 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.370
 file here 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.590
 The name of this one you can look for 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.110
 on the internet that you can download in 3 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.070
 megas you play the computer was this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.900
 procedure 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.300
 I told you that later we 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.480
 Speak here ok, so this is a 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.670
 personal procedure of how you 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.190
 install chrome cast when it is not 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.800
 allowed in the country 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.500
 For example, Brazil gave the message 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.680
 we make this way to the next step 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.810
 now I will connect the cast movie on tv and 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.850
 I'll try to connect to this program 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.220
 here to do with sharing there 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.740
 for you to see photos and who knows video 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.390
 I'll take the personal test in that 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.450
 First, this first step that is 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.610
 explain how to do this without holtz in 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.090
 racks with nothing 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.400
 simple and practical shape and touch 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.150
 So that's what the video is getting. 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.940
 around here 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.780
 if you like the OSCE joinha leaves a 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.440
 message 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.280
