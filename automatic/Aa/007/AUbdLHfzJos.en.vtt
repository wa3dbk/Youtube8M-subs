in<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> explain<00:00:02.310> what

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this video I'm going to explain what

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.280 
in this video I'm going to explain what
the<00:00:02.850> difference<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.330> between<00:00:03.510> strength<00:00:04.140> and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
the difference is between strength and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.680 
the difference is between strength and
power<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.520> means<00:00:05.640> specifically<00:00:06.240> to

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
power and what it means specifically to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:26.599 
power and what it means specifically to

then working on with the right stages of

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.679 
then working on with the right stages of
your<00:02:06.130> training<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.180> end<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.570> with

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
your training so you end up with

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.960 
your training so you end up with
explosive<00:02:08.259> power<00:02:08.500> by<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.069> time<00:02:09.310> you're<00:02:09.580> ready
