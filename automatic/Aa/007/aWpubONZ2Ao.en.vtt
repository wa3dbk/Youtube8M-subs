shot is incredible I'm going to go a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.649 
shot is incredible I'm going to go a
little<00:01:07.080> faster<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.650> ok

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

hydraulic steering got to be easier when

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.770 
hydraulic steering got to be easier when
I<00:01:34.159> got<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.490> from<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.820> cable<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.360> this<00:01:35.600> is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
I got that from the cable and this is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.450 
I got that from the cable and this is
even<00:01:35.899> easier<00:01:36.259> than<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.560> what<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.369> mean

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
even easier than that what this I mean

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.609 
even easier than that what this I mean
it's<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.030> know<00:01:38.060> I'm<00:01:38.420> saying<00:01:38.659> one<00:01:39.049> finger

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.770 

I'd<00:01:42.619> say<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.009> steering<00:01:43.399> is<00:01:43.520> three<00:01:43.820> times<00:01:44.149> more

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
I'd say the steering is three times more

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.190 
I'd say the steering is three times more
responsive<00:01:45.470> than<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:46.549> Yamaha<00:01:50.200> is

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
responsive than the Yamaha is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.370 
responsive than the Yamaha is
unbelievable

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
fact you're only dealing at one lever
