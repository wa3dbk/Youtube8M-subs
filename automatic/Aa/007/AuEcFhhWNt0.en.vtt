must be learned so must can't be take a
big<00:02:37.250> step<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.700> getting<00:02:37.910> take<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> little<00:02:38.510> step

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
big step so getting take a little step

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.800 
big step so getting take a little step
yet<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.530> reach<00:02:39.950> over<00:02:40.280> there<00:02:40.600> all<00:02:41.600> right

way thing just going to the side won't
same<00:03:00.980> regular<00:03:01.489> wave<00:03:01.700> step<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> side<00:03:02.950> same

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
same regular wave step to the side same

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.720 
same regular wave step to the side same
regular<00:03:04.519> way<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:05.390> come<00:03:05.870> forward<00:03:06.730> same
