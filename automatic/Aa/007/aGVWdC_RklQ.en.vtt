00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.030 
her the perfect color blend that is
super<00:01:35.810> natural<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.380> matches<00:01:36.860> her<00:01:36.979> hair

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
super natural and matches her hair

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.460 
super natural and matches her hair
perfectly<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.180> installation<00:01:41.659> actually

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
perfectly so this installation actually

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.430 
perfectly so this installation actually
took<00:01:42.619> about<00:01:42.680> three<00:01:43.220> hours<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.700> do<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.440> that's

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
took about three hours to do and that's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.310 
took about three hours to do and that's
only<00:01:45.649> because<00:01:45.890> she<00:01:46.369> has<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:46.880> much<00:01:47.240> hair<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.899> had

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
only because she has so much hair we had

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.020 
only because she has so much hair we had
to<00:01:48.500> use<00:01:48.679> eight<00:01:48.950> bundles<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.429> hair<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.880> to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
to use eight bundles of hair just to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.240 
to use eight bundles of hair just to
match<00:01:50.240> her<00:01:50.600> thickness<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.100> would

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
match her thickness so that it would

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.270 
match her thickness so that it would
look<00:01:52.429> seamless<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.750> normally<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.770> would<00:01:55.039> say

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
look seamless so normally I would say

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.609 
look seamless so normally I would say
normal<00:01:56.030> people<00:01:56.420> would<00:01:56.659> use<00:01:56.869> about<00:01:57.080> five

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
normal people would use about five

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.399 
normal people would use about five
bundles<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.520> hair<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.080> that<00:02:00.080> would<00:02:00.289> be

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
bundles of hair and that would be

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.080 
bundles of hair and that would be
perfect<00:02:00.860> for<00:02:00.920> length<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.490> volume<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.970> if<00:02:04.970> you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
perfect for length and volume so if you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.370 
perfect for length and volume so if you
guys<00:02:05.270> are<00:02:05.450> interested<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:06.170> getting
