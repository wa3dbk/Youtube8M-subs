00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
showing on the screen here but the I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
showing on the screen here but the I
thought<00:00:45.149> why<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> game<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.710> Luigi

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
thought why go through the game as Luigi

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
thought why go through the game as Luigi
it<00:00:47.670> would<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.149> another<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.750> month<00:00:49.289> or

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it would take me another like month or

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
it would take me another like month or
so<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.250> through<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.579> game<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so just to go through the game just to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.930 
so just to go through the game just to
make<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.020> part<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.430> thought<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.670> would

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
make one part so I just thought it would

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.740 
make one part so I just thought it would
show<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.590> main<00:00:55.980> save<00:00:56.280> file<00:00:56.750> just
