condensation<00:01:07.700> mold<00:01:08.270> problems<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.319> we<00:01:09.409> have<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
condensation mold problems so we have to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.469 
condensation mold problems so we have to
worry<00:01:09.859> about<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.609> then<00:01:11.030> also<00:01:11.179> when<00:01:11.420> you

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
worry about that and then also when you

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.719 
worry about that and then also when you
have<00:01:11.509> holes<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.020> ducts<00:01:12.579> let's<00:01:13.579> say

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
have holes and ducts let's say

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.160 
have holes and ducts let's say
particularly<00:01:14.179> in<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.299> return<00:01:14.569> side<00:01:14.840> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
particularly in the return side and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.429 
particularly in the return side and
you're<00:01:15.319> sucking<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:17.090> air<00:01:17.299> from<00:01:17.569> a<00:01:17.749> space

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
you're sucking in the air from a space

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.959 
you're sucking in the air from a space
like<00:01:18.619> an<00:01:18.740> attic<00:01:19.039> or<00:01:19.069> a<00:01:19.249> crawlspace<00:01:19.549> you're

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
like an attic or a crawlspace you're

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.919 
like an attic or a crawlspace you're
bringing<00:01:20.329> humidity<00:01:20.840> dust<00:01:21.649> dirt<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.719> cold<00:01:23.719> or

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
bringing humidity dust dirt and cold or

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.169 
bringing humidity dust dirt and cold or
hot<00:01:24.139> temperatures<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.340> ducts<00:01:25.729> are<00:01:25.969> just

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
hot temperatures so ducts are just

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.059 
hot temperatures so ducts are just
really<00:01:26.600> important<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.380> right<00:01:27.529> and<00:01:27.590> also

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
really important to get right and also

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.859 
really important to get right and also
when<00:01:28.219> they're<00:01:28.369> sealed<00:01:28.670> properly<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.749> entire

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
when they're sealed properly the entire

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.800 
when they're sealed properly the entire
HVAC<00:01:30.679> system<00:01:31.099> works<00:01:31.310> better<00:01:31.579> as<00:01:31.939> intended<00:01:32.450> I

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
HVAC system works better as intended I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050 
HVAC system works better as intended I
tried<00:01:33.079> using<00:01:33.319> all<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.770> conventional<00:01:34.639> methods

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
tried using all the conventional methods

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.389 
tried using all the conventional methods
to<00:01:35.209> correct<00:01:35.539> a<00:01:35.659> problem<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:36.170> try<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.439> use<00:01:36.649> duct

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
to correct a problem I try to use duct

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.510 
to correct a problem I try to use duct
tape<00:01:37.429> caulking<00:01:38.799> especially<00:01:39.799> on<00:01:39.950> all<00:01:40.369> the

tape caulking especially on all the
ductwork<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:41.149> could<00:01:41.299> see<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
ductwork that I could see in the

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.809 
ductwork that I could see in the
basement<00:01:42.049> but<00:01:42.619> all<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.039> was<00:01:43.279> ineffective

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
basement but all of this was ineffective

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.059 
basement but all of this was ineffective
because<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.569> air<00:01:44.749> leak<00:01:45.139> itself<00:01:45.649> was<00:01:45.889> actually

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
because the air leak itself was actually

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.010 
because the air leak itself was actually
coming<00:01:46.700> through<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.999> walls<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.479> not<00:01:47.749> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
in the winter time was that our upstairs

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.100 
in the winter time was that our upstairs
bedrooms<00:03:02.430> were<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:03.060> cold<00:03:03.510> at<00:03:03.690> night<00:03:03.870> before

we<00:03:04.410> went<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.620> bed<00:03:04.829> we<00:03:05.069> would<00:03:05.220> shut<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.610> vents

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
we went to bed we would shut the vents

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.030 
we went to bed we would shut the vents
on<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.060> main<00:03:06.329> floor<00:03:06.600> hoping<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.890> air

on the main floor hoping that the air
would<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.549> forced<00:03:09.000> upstairs<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.900> also<00:03:10.079> had

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
would be forced upstairs we also had

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.440 
would be forced upstairs we also had
heated<00:03:10.799> blankets<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.400> our<00:03:11.519> beds<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.359> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
heated blankets on our beds but it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.059 
heated blankets on our beds but it
really<00:03:12.750> wasn't<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.049> great<00:03:13.260> solution<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.920> our

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
really wasn't a great solution to our

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.370 
really wasn't a great solution to our
problem<00:03:14.579> because<00:03:14.760> our<00:03:15.359> downstairs<00:03:15.930> was<00:03:16.230> then

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
problem because our downstairs was then

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.289 
problem because our downstairs was then
cold<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.920> morning<00:03:17.280> my<00:03:17.730> house<00:03:18.000> when<00:03:18.239> I

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
cold in the morning my house when I

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.559 
cold in the morning my house when I
bought<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.840> knew<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.700> 1980<00:03:20.700> vintage<00:03:21.359> home

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
bought it I knew is a 1980 vintage home

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.539 
bought it I knew is a 1980 vintage home
and<00:03:21.900> therefore<00:03:22.079> had<00:03:22.440> extremely<00:03:22.920> leaky<00:03:23.310> ducts

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and therefore had extremely leaky ducts

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.460 
and therefore had extremely leaky ducts
I<00:03:23.910> realized<00:03:24.900> they<00:03:25.019> were<00:03:25.079> leaky<00:03:25.380> as<00:03:25.739> they<00:03:25.920> were

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
I realized they were leaky as they were

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.629 
I realized they were leaky as they were
one<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> only<00:03:28.709> systems<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.310> thought<00:03:29.519> would

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
one of the only systems I thought would

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.210 
one of the only systems I thought would
work<00:03:29.819> for<00:03:29.970> me<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.329> an<00:03:30.450> aerosol<00:03:30.780> based

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
work for me was an aerosol based

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.379 
work for me was an aerosol based
injection<00:03:32.220> system<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.790> definitely<00:03:33.239> that's

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
injection system I definitely that's

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.420 
injection system I definitely that's
very<00:03:33.630> complicated<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:34.380> not<00:03:34.620> accessible<00:03:34.980> so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
very complicated and not accessible so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.970 
very complicated and not accessible so
an<00:03:35.700> aerosol<00:03:36.600> injection<00:03:36.750> system<00:03:37.440> was<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
an aerosol injection system was a very

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.230 
an aerosol injection system was a very
difficult

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
difficult

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.390 
difficult
and<00:03:39.330> when<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.410> did<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.770> we<00:03:40.950> reduced<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
and when we did it we reduced the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.120 
and when we did it we reduced the
leakage<00:03:41.850> from<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.330> over<00:03:42.660> 600<00:03:43.200> CFM<00:03:43.410> down<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
leakage from like over 600 CFM down to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.520 
leakage from like over 600 CFM down to
about<00:03:44.550> 80<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.480> that's<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:45.810> 80%<00:03:46.140> reduction

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
about 80 so that's I got 80% reduction

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.130 
about 80 so that's I got 80% reduction
to<00:03:46.950> leakage<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.490> can<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.790> imagine<00:03:47.970> how<00:03:48.960> much

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
to leakage so can you imagine how much

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.140 
to leakage so can you imagine how much
waste<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.650> had<00:03:49.830> in<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.100> particular<00:03:50.430> house<00:03:50.760> but

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
waste I had in this particular house but

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.050 
waste I had in this particular house but
I<00:03:51.210> knew<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.540> going<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:52.610> but<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.640> was<00:03:53.910> willing

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
I knew that going in but I was willing

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.430 
I knew that going in but I was willing
to<00:03:54.180> buy<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.420> house<00:03:54.720> knowing<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.230> there<00:03:55.410> was

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
to buy this house knowing that there was

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.290 
to buy this house knowing that there was
a<00:03:55.590> technology<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.400> help<00:03:56.430> me<00:03:56.760> fix<00:03:57.060> such<00:03:57.270> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
a technology that can help me fix such a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.360 
a technology that can help me fix such a
significant<00:03:58.020> problem<00:03:58.260> we<00:03:58.680> first<00:03:58.890> considered

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
significant problem we first considered

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.680 
significant problem we first considered
stealing<00:03:59.700> our<00:03:59.790> ductwork<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.300> improve<00:04:00.570> our

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
stealing our ductwork to improve our

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.120 
stealing our ductwork to improve our
indoor<00:04:00.930> air<00:04:01.080> quality<00:04:01.110> because<00:04:01.620> dust<00:04:01.920> was<00:04:02.100> a

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
indoor air quality because dust was a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.260 
indoor air quality because dust was a
problem<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.730> our<00:04:02.820> kids<00:04:03.030> were<00:04:03.120> always

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
problem and our kids were always

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.150 
problem and our kids were always
fighting<00:04:03.570> allergies<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.830> then<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.100> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
fighting allergies but then when the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.710 
fighting allergies but then when the
aerosol<00:04:05.550> representative<00:04:06.180> came<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
aerosol representative came out and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.020 
aerosol representative came out and
showed<00:04:06.930> us<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.380> holes<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.250> our<00:04:08.310> ductwork<00:04:08.670> and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
showed us the holes in our ductwork and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.610 
showed us the holes in our ductwork and
how<00:04:09.210> much<00:04:09.390> air<00:04:09.630> we<00:04:09.780> were<00:04:09.930> losing<00:04:10.110> through

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
how much air we were losing through

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.100 
how much air we were losing through
there<00:04:10.910> we<00:04:11.910> thought<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.450> know<00:04:12.570> gosh<00:04:12.810> we're

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
there we thought you know gosh we're

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
there we thought you know gosh we're
just<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.410> throwing<00:04:13.770> money<00:04:14.040> away<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.370> mean

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
just really throwing money away I mean

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.580 
just really throwing money away I mean
it<00:04:14.730> would<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.090> having<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.480> car<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
it would be like having a car with a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.080 
it would be like having a car with a
whole<00:04:16.770> new<00:04:16.920> gas<00:04:17.100> tank<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.549> driving<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> around

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
whole new gas tank and driving it around

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.060 
whole new gas tank and driving it around
and<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.660> losing<00:04:19.260> gas<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.590> knew<00:04:19.739> we<00:04:19.920> were

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and just losing gas I knew we were

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.470 
and just losing gas I knew we were
losing<00:04:20.250> money<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.820> we<00:04:20.940> had<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.270> something

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
losing money and we had to do something

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.790 
losing money and we had to do something
about<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.530> were<00:04:22.650> amazed<00:04:23.100> by<00:04:23.550> how<00:04:23.940> fast

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
about it we were amazed by how fast

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.320 
about it we were amazed by how fast
Aeroseal<00:04:25.800> was<00:04:26.040> installed<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:26.640> our<00:04:26.730> home<00:04:27.000> there

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
Aeroseal was installed in our home there

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.390 
Aeroseal was installed in our home there
was<00:04:27.450> no<00:04:27.630> mass<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.140> was<00:04:28.290> no<00:04:28.470> cleanup<00:04:29.010> after

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
was no mass there was no cleanup after

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.430 
was no mass there was no cleanup after
the<00:04:29.520> crews<00:04:29.760> came<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.540> was<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> very<00:04:31.230> quick

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the crews came in it was a very quick

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.990 
the crews came in it was a very quick
and<00:04:31.620> easy<00:04:31.710> process<00:04:31.980> we<00:04:32.460> noticed<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.850> big

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
and easy process we noticed a big

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.820 
and easy process we noticed a big
improvement<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.690> air<00:04:33.810> flow<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
improvement in the air flow and the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.130 
improvement in the air flow and the
balance<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.370> temperature<00:04:35.880> we<00:04:36.840> could<00:04:36.990> even

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
balance of the temperature we could even

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.370 
balance of the temperature we could even
see<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.370> air<00:04:38.520> flow<00:04:38.790> on<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.380> window

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
see it the air flow on the window

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.890 
see it the air flow on the window
treatments<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:42.030> temperature<00:04:42.480> was<00:04:42.690> more

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
treatments the temperature was more

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.660 
treatments the temperature was more
balanced<00:04:43.380> especially<00:04:43.800> in<00:04:43.920> those<00:04:44.040> rooms<00:04:44.280> over

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
balanced especially in those rooms over

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.460 
balanced especially in those rooms over
furthest<00:04:45.030> away<00:04:45.180> from<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.510> furnace<00:04:45.960> we<00:04:46.230> were

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
furthest away from the furnace we were

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.820 
furthest away from the furnace we were
we're<00:04:47.070> really<00:04:47.370> very<00:04:47.760> pleased<00:04:48.120> with<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.680> I

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
we're really very pleased with with it I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.470 
we're really very pleased with with it I
mean<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:50.520> quite<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.910> noticeable

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
mean it it's quite a noticeable

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.930 
mean it it's quite a noticeable
difference<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:52.160> think<00:04:53.160> anybody<00:04:53.400> with<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
difference I think anybody with the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.870 
difference I think anybody with the
forced<00:04:54.270> air<00:04:54.450> furnace<00:04:54.480> could<00:04:55.080> benefit<00:04:55.530> by<00:04:55.710> this

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
forced air furnace could benefit by this

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.480 
forced air furnace could benefit by this
rather<00:04:56.880> than<00:04:57.530> disrupting<00:04:58.530> their<00:04:58.860> house<00:04:59.250> by

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
rather than disrupting their house by

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.990 
rather than disrupting their house by
tearing<00:04:59.940> out<00:05:00.060> all<00:05:00.270> their<00:05:00.450> drywall
