you<00:00:41.410> should<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.770> and<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.220> most<00:00:42.460> important<00:00:43.000> is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
you should do and the most important is

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.080 
you should do and the most important is
put<00:00:43.330> your<00:00:43.510> fabric<00:00:43.750> on<00:00:44.080> grain<00:00:44.680> on<00:00:45.220> grain<00:00:45.760> means

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
put your fabric on grain on grain means

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.970 
put your fabric on grain on grain means
your<00:00:46.270> lengthwise<00:00:46.690> grain<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.320> your<00:00:47.440> crosswise

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
your lengthwise grain and your crosswise

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.520 
your lengthwise grain and your crosswise
grain<00:00:48.010> aren't<00:00:48.550> exactly<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.329> 90-degree<00:00:50.050> angle

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
grain aren't exactly a 90-degree angle

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.440 
grain aren't exactly a 90-degree angle
and<00:00:50.680> this<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.430> especially<00:00:51.880> important<00:00:52.420> that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
and this is especially important that

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.180 
and this is especially important that
it's<00:00:52.660> done<00:00:52.840> before<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.560> cut<00:00:53.829> out<00:00:53.980> your<00:00:54.010> fabric

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
it's done before you cut out your fabric

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.150 
it's done before you cut out your fabric
so<00:00:55.150> some<00:00:55.750> fabrics<00:00:56.320> when<00:00:56.590> they've<00:00:56.710> been<00:00:56.739> rolled

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
so some fabrics when they've been rolled

on the bolt may have shifted out of
place<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.620> we<00:00:59.680> need<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.890> put<00:01:00.040> them<00:01:00.160> back<00:01:00.280> on

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
place and we need to put them back on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.880 
place and we need to put them back on
grain<00:01:00.790> before<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.450> cut<00:01:01.630> everything<00:01:01.720> out<00:01:02.110> there

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890

are<00:01:03.010> four<00:01:03.430> ways<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:04.149> putting<00:01:04.420> your<00:01:04.629> fabric<00:01:04.989> on

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
are four ways of putting your fabric on

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.920 
are four ways of putting your fabric on
grain<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:06.190> first<00:01:06.490> way<00:01:06.790> which<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.420> easiest

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
grain the first way which is the easiest

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.080 
grain the first way which is the easiest
thing<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.260> do<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.310> cut<00:01:09.580> across<00:01:09.970> your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
thing to do is to cut across your

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.730 
thing to do is to cut across your
salvage<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:15.360> tear<00:01:16.360> from<00:01:16.390> one<00:01:16.960> selvage<00:01:17.530> all

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
salvage and tear from one selvage all

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.710 
salvage and tear from one selvage all
the<00:01:18.040> way<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.430> next

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.650 

now<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.680> ensure<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.370> your<00:01:24.850> fabric<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.300> torn

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
now to ensure that your fabric is torn

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.780 
now to ensure that your fabric is torn
across<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.470> crosswise<00:01:26.890> grain<00:01:26.920> you're<00:01:27.670> going

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
across the crosswise grain you're going

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.270

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
way of putting your fabric on grain but

methods and they don't work with your
type<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.750> fabric<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> method<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
type of fabric this is the method that

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.430 
type of fabric this is the method that
you'll<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:15.940> use<00:03:16.060> you're<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.140> line

you'll have to use you're going to line

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.259 
you'll have to use you're going to line
up<00:03:17.470> your<00:03:17.680> salvages<00:03:18.430> with<00:03:18.700> your<00:03:18.820> right<00:03:19.000> sides

up<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.110> down<00:03:24.349> now<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.010> may<00:03:25.280> need<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.670> shift

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
up and down now you may need to shift

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.540 
up and down now you may need to shift
one<00:03:26.599> Salvage<00:03:27.080> over<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:28.220> don't<00:03:28.400> get

one Salvage over so that you don't get

one Salvage over so that you don't get
those<00:03:28.730> waves<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> bottom<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.290> that's

those waves in the bottom but that's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.670 
those waves in the bottom but that's
what<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.830> want<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:32.080> all<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.319> this<00:03:33.470> is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
what you want to do all of this is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.440 
what you want to do all of this is
especially<00:03:34.099> important<00:03:34.760> when<00:03:34.940> you're<00:03:35.180> sewing

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
especially important when you're sewing

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.930 
especially important when you're sewing
garments<00:03:35.920> because<00:03:36.920> fabric<00:03:37.400> tends<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.849> shift

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
garments because fabric tends to shift
