nice strippers arm which is a 3 3/8 inch

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.799 
nice strippers arm which is a 3 3/8 inch
steak<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.820> I've<00:00:35.820> lined<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
steak and I've lined it up with my

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.840 
steak and I've lined it up with my
notches<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> 3/8<00:00:39.239> inch<00:00:39.739> turn

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
notches so that I have a 3/8 inch turn

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.500 
notches so that I have a 3/8 inch turn
and<00:00:41.850> I've<00:00:42.180> done<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.809> each<00:00:44.180> pattern<00:00:45.180> piece

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and I've done this on each pattern piece

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
and I've done this on each pattern piece
in<00:00:45.690> each<00:00:45.899> edge<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.160> edges

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in each edge because all these edges

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
in each edge because all these edges
will<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> worn<00:00:48.120> together<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
will be worn together so we're going to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:01.190 
will be worn together so we're going to
quickly<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.280> turn<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.149> one

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.870 

while<00:01:02.200> you<00:01:02.320> turn<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.770> and<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.400> have<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.580> nice

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
while you turn it and you have a nice

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.700 
while you turn it and you have a nice
clean<00:01:04.330> edge<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.880> use<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> picture<00:01:07.930> back<00:01:08.110> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
clean edge to use the picture back and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.110 
clean edge to use the picture back and
we're<00:01:08.980> going<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.250> do<00:01:09.370> this<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.790> all<00:01:09.970> our

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
we're going to do this with all our

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.420 
we're going to do this with all our
pieces

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
pieces

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.130 
pieces
hopefully<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.670> turn<00:01:12.880> each<00:01:13.030> piece<00:01:13.360> are<00:01:14.020> in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
hopefully just turn each piece are in

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.330 
hopefully just turn each piece are in
the<00:01:14.229> edges<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.770> gusset<00:01:15.190> though<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.770> lined

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the edges of the gusset though and lined

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.660 
the edges of the gusset though and lined
up<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:18.760> our<00:01:18.880> notches<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.250> that's<00:01:21.490> why

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
up with our notches and that's why

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.250 
up with our notches and that's why
notches<00:01:22.180> are<00:01:22.300> really<00:01:22.600> important<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.140> helps

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
notches are really important it helps

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.430 
notches are really important it helps

lines<00:01:56.649> together<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> little<00:01:58.450> rubber

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
lines together with a little rubber

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.109 
lines together with a little rubber
cement<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.710> make<00:01:59.890> sure<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.610> everything

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
cement just to make sure that everything

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.710 
cement just to make sure that everything
is<00:02:01.270> fitting<00:02:02.190> before<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.460> sew<00:02:03.910> so<00:02:04.180> what<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.450> is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
is fitting before I sew so what I do is

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.649 
is fitting before I sew so what I do is
basically<00:02:04.899> go<00:02:05.380> around<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.820> threes<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
basically go around that that threes and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.139 
basically go around that that threes and
seam<00:02:07.960> allowance<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.739> have<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.910> just

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
seam allowance that I have and I just

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.449 
seam allowance that I have and I just
put<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> little<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.709> rubber<00:02:11.890> cement<00:02:12.190> along

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
put a little little rubber cement along

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.430 
put a little little rubber cement along
the<00:02:12.790> edges<00:02:13.180> there<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.840> you'd<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> little

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.289 
the edges there if you'd like a little
quarter<00:02:14.920> edge<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:16.540> enough<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:18.299> hold

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
quarter edge just enough to hold

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.770 
quarter edge just enough to hold
everything<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:20.080> place<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:22.209> make<00:02:22.390> sure<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
everything in place to make sure that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.560 
everything in place to make sure that
our<00:02:23.250> things<00:02:24.250> are<00:02:24.519> going<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.450> fit<00:02:25.780> properly

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
our things are going to fit properly

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.250 
our things are going to fit properly
when<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.600> get<00:02:28.870> really<00:02:29.140> good<00:02:29.519> maybe<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:32.019> won't

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
when you get really good maybe you won't

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.930 
when you get really good maybe you won't
want<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.489> but<00:02:33.880> I'm<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.810> showing<00:02:35.110> you

want to do this but I'm just showing you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630 
want to do this but I'm just showing you
the<00:02:36.940> technique<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.630> used<00:02:38.140> when<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.100> started

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the technique I used when I started

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.780 
the technique I used when I started
doing<00:02:40.000> bags<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.830> got<00:02:41.830> comfortable<00:02:42.160> that's<00:02:42.640> my

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
doing bags I got comfortable that's my

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.930 
doing bags I got comfortable that's my
pattern<00:02:43.239> making<00:02:43.829> this<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:45.040> how<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> made<00:02:45.549> sure

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
pattern making this is how I made sure

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.560 
pattern making this is how I made sure
that<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.590> wasn't<00:02:47.590> using<00:02:48.130> wasting<00:02:48.790> material<00:02:50.160> so

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that I wasn't using wasting material so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.720 
that I wasn't using wasting material so
we're<00:02:52.570> going<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.470> three<00:02:54.459> pieces

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
we're going to do this to three pieces

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.020 
we're going to do this to three pieces
and<00:02:55.299> when<00:02:56.019> we're<00:02:56.230> finished<00:02:56.500> I'll<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.310> back

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
they are on alignment and that lets you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
they are on alignment and that lets you
know<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.579> everything<00:04:03.450> that's<00:04:03.600> going<00:04:03.780> to

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
know that everything that's going to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.780 
know that everything that's going to
kind<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.109> fit<00:04:04.440> properly<00:04:04.799> when<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.549> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
kind of fit properly when you do that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.870 
kind of fit properly when you do that
and<00:04:06.440> stuff<00:04:07.440> starts<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:07.889> come<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
and stuff starts to come out and the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.390 
and stuff starts to come out and the
alignment<00:04:09.389> is<00:04:09.480> right<00:04:09.810> try<00:04:10.739> not<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.950> stretch

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
alignment is right try not to stretch

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.599 
alignment is right try not to stretch
your<00:04:11.549> material<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.420> go<00:04:12.600> around<00:04:13.609> because

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
your material as you go around because

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.520 
your material as you go around because
that<00:04:15.000> could<00:04:15.569> throw<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.620> off<00:04:17.600> or<00:04:18.600> give<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.470> an

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
that could throw you off or give you an

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.110 
that could throw you off or give you an
illusion<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:20.250> something<00:04:20.669> that's<00:04:20.850> wrong

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
illusion like something that's wrong

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.690 
illusion like something that's wrong
when<00:04:21.539> it's<00:04:21.690> not<00:04:22.380> really<00:04:22.950> wrong

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.300 

here<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.880> go<00:04:29.070> whoops<00:04:30.070> something<00:04:30.850> wrong<00:04:31.170> and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
here we go whoops something wrong and

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.960 
here we go whoops something wrong and
that<00:04:33.310> could<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:33.790> for<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> number<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.570> reasons

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.560 

and<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.080> lets<00:04:41.290> us<00:04:41.470> know<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:42.040> our<00:04:42.850> gusset

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
and so that lets us know that our gusset

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.780 
and so that lets us know that our gusset
is<00:04:43.750> fitting<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.440> now<00:04:44.680> we<00:04:44.740> can<00:04:45.160> go<00:04:45.340> ahead<00:04:45.400> and
