for<00:00:01.829> our<00:00:01.920> next<00:00:02.100> test<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> compare

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
for our next test we're going to compare

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.780 
for our next test we're going to compare
the<00:00:03.870> strength<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.500> shingle<00:00:04.950> versus<00:00:05.460> tile

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the strength of shingle versus tile

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.530 
the strength of shingle versus tile
roofing<00:00:06.240> material<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.140> first<00:00:07.639> tile<00:00:11.210> red<00:00:12.210> tile

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
roofing material the first tile red tile

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.720 
roofing material the first tile red tile
is<00:00:12.780> popular<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.500> hurricane<00:00:13.950> zones<00:00:14.250> because

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is popular in hurricane zones because

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.820 
is popular in hurricane zones because
hurricane<00:00:15.330> zones<00:00:15.660> tend<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> be<00:00:16.199> warm<00:00:16.470> areas

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
hurricane zones tend to be warm areas

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.760 
hurricane zones tend to be warm areas
like<00:00:17.279> Florida<00:00:17.760> or<00:00:17.910> Texas<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.260> red<00:00:19.500> tile

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
like Florida or Texas and the red tile

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
like Florida or Texas and the red tile
does<00:00:20.070> an<00:00:20.220> excellent<00:00:20.609> job<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.000> protecting<00:00:21.570> your

does an excellent job of protecting your
roof<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.230> damage<00:00:22.710> caused<00:00:22.980> by<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> Sun<00:00:23.900> there

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
roof from damage caused by the Sun there

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.019 
roof from damage caused by the Sun there
are<00:00:24.930> less<00:00:25.199> ideal<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.920> high<00:00:26.070> wind<00:00:26.099> situation

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
are less ideal in a high wind situation

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
are less ideal in a high wind situation
because<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> wind<00:00:27.630> tends<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.260> under<00:00:28.529> them

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
because the wind tends to get under them

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
because the wind tends to get under them
and<00:00:28.890> lift<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.760> once<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.990> goes<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and lift them and once one goes the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.020 
and lift them and once one goes the
second<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.040> goes<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
second one goes and then you have a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
second one goes and then you have a
progressive<00:00:33.450> failure<00:00:34.010> what<00:00:35.010> we've<00:00:35.190> done<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
progressive failure what we've done is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.910 
progressive failure what we've done is
attached<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> tiles<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> roof<00:00:37.380> three

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
attached the tiles to this roof three

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
attached the tiles to this roof three
ways<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.969> Left<00:00:39.210> we've<00:00:39.719> used<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.110> foam

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
ways on the Left we've used a foam

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
ways on the Left we've used a foam
adhesive<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> center<00:00:41.850> traditional

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
mortar and on the right the tiles are

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.410 
mortar and on the right the tiles are
attached<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.440> nails

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 

that<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.929> just<00:00:55.230> mansard<00:00:55.769> roof<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> most

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that are just mansard roof are the most

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.899 
that are just mansard roof are the most
vulnerable<00:00:56.789> oh<00:00:57.679> that's<00:00:58.679> better<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
vulnerable oh that's better but even the

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.139 
vulnerable oh that's better but even the
mortar<00:01:00.359> isn't<00:01:00.690> impervious<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> failure<00:01:02.149> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
mortar isn't impervious to failure if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
mortar isn't impervious to failure if
you're<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.870> red<00:01:04.470> tiles<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.280> high

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you're gonna use red tiles in a high

you're gonna use red tiles in a high
wind<00:01:05.899> environment<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.040> sure

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
wind environment you want to make sure

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
wind environment you want to make sure
that<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:08.729> packed<00:01:09.149> with<00:01:09.360> mortar<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that they're packed with mortar or that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.840 
that they're packed with mortar or that
you've<00:01:10.619> taken<00:01:10.770> steps<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.520> wind

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you've taken steps so that the wind

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
you've taken steps so that the wind
can't<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.420> under<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> tile<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> lift<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
can't get under the tile and lift it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
can't get under the tile and lift it
mortar<00:01:14.789> is<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.539> most<00:01:15.690> typical

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
oh sure the wind and rain are

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.090 
oh sure the wind and rain are

hit the edge of the roof causing tile
lift<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.180> then<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.660> have<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.990> cascading

next thing your roofs coming off so it's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.230 
next thing your roofs coming off so it's
