00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
liking the organic aspect it almost

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.970 
liking the organic aspect it almost
seems<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.870> you're<00:03:11.080> trying<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.440> contour<00:03:11.950> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
seems like you're trying to contour the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.180 
seems like you're trying to contour the
shapes<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.810> transformers<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.050> their<00:03:14.620> faces

shapes of transformers and their faces

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.900 
shapes of transformers and their faces
and<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.730> their<00:03:16.030> physique<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.989> look<00:03:17.320> more

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
and this their physique to look more

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.640 
and this their physique to look more
human<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.330> they're<00:03:19.930> trying<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.290> give<00:03:20.470> these

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
human like they're trying to give these

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.070 
human like they're trying to give these
characters<00:03:21.130> more<00:03:21.340> human<00:03:22.209> characteristics

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
characters more human characteristics

characters more human characteristics
and<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.580> object<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
and I really have to object to that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.370 
and I really have to object to that
because<00:03:26.910> transformers<00:03:27.910> are<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:29.049> words<00:03:29.230> of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
because transformers are in the words of

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.170 
because transformers are in the words of

Optimus Prime they are autonomous
robotic<00:03:32.049> organisms<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.070> fact<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.370> they

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
back to recent ToyNews few days ago I

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.430 
back to recent ToyNews few days ago I
believe<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.430> was<00:05:09.639> Saturday<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.870> we<00:05:10.990> got<00:05:11.169> our

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
believe it was Saturday and we got our

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.360 
believe it was Saturday and we got our
first<00:05:11.979> look<00:05:12.280> at<00:05:12.639> appears<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.780> be<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.370> swoop

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
first look at appears to be a swoop

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.129 
first look at appears to be a swoop
reason<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:15.940> say<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.210> appears<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.570> be<00:05:16.660> swooped<00:05:16.930> is

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
reason I say it appears to be swooped is

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.080 
reason I say it appears to be swooped is
because<00:05:17.470> it's<00:05:17.680> very<00:05:17.889> animal<00:05:18.580> like<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:18.970> has

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
because it's very animal like it has

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.510 
because it's very animal like it has
wings<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.840> obviously<00:05:20.500> with<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:20.919> Dinobots

wings and obviously with the Dinobots

wings and obviously with the Dinobots
the<00:05:21.699> obvious<00:05:22.060> choices<00:05:22.300> swoop<00:05:22.750> but<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.169> code

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
the obvious choices swoop but the code

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.210 
the obvious choices swoop but the code
name<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.770> they<00:05:23.889> use<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.610> polly<00:05:25.479> olly<00:05:26.470> if<00:05:26.889> you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
name that they use is polly olly if you

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.550 
name that they use is polly olly if you

remember the code names on the the

code<00:05:32.200> names<00:05:32.410> on<00:05:32.590> there<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.280> looks<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.700> if

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
code names on there and it looks like if

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.930 
code names on there and it looks like if
this<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.510> swoop<00:05:34.900> we<00:05:35.410> will<00:05:35.620> be<00:05:35.830> seeing<00:05:36.099> a<00:05:36.340> deluxe

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
this is swoop we will be seeing a deluxe

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.560 
this is swoop we will be seeing a deluxe
class<00:05:37.150> Polly<00:05:37.840> as<00:05:38.169> well<00:05:38.710> as<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:39.370> few<00:05:39.669> Asian<00:05:40.240> class

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
class Polly as well as a few Asian class

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.390 
class Polly as well as a few Asian class
pawleys<00:05:41.500> so<00:05:41.740> we're<00:05:41.860> going<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.039> be<00:05:42.130> getting<00:05:42.250> a

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
pawleys so we're going to be getting a

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.050 
pawleys so we're going to be getting a
deluxe<00:05:42.669> swoop<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:44.289> legion<00:05:44.889> class<00:05:45.130> swoop<00:05:45.789> I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
deluxe swoop and a legion class swoop I

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.020 
deluxe swoop and a legion class swoop I
am<00:05:46.450> worried<00:05:46.960> really<00:05:47.740> about<00:05:48.070> size<00:05:48.520> differences

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
am worried really about size differences

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.430 
am worried really about size differences
because<00:05:49.300> if<00:05:49.419> we're<00:05:49.570> getting<00:05:49.660> a<00:05:49.870> leader<00:05:50.139> class

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
because if we're getting a leader class

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.350 
because if we're getting a leader class
gridlock<00:05:51.310> he's<00:05:51.610> going<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.789> be<00:05:51.849> like<00:05:51.970> this<00:05:52.150> big

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
gridlock he's going to be like this big

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.140 
gridlock he's going to be like this big
then<00:05:52.570> we're<00:05:52.660> going<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.810> get<00:05:52.930> deluxe<00:05:53.410> swoop

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
then we're going to get deluxe swoop

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.050 
then we're going to get deluxe swoop
that's<00:05:55.150> going<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.419> be<00:05:55.449> like<00:05:56.130> here<00:05:57.130> scale-wise

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
that's going to be like here scale-wise

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.409 
that's going to be like here scale-wise
that<00:05:58.630> just<00:05:58.840> doesn't<00:05:59.080> seem<00:05:59.500> quite<00:05:59.860> right

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
that just doesn't seem quite right

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.550 
that just doesn't seem quite right
especially<00:06:01.419> with<00:06:01.510> all<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.780> other<00:06:02.110> Dinobots

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
especially with all the other Dinobots

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.620 
especially with all the other Dinobots
so<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:02.860> am<00:06:03.190> just<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.880> little<00:06:04.120> bit<00:06:04.210> worried<00:06:04.479> about

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
so I am just a little bit worried about

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.540 
so I am just a little bit worried about
that<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.229> see<00:06:05.380> how<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.680> pans<00:06:05.830> out<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.280> doubt

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
that and to see how it pans out I doubt

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.570 
that and to see how it pans out I doubt
that<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.449> toy<00:06:07.660> she<00:06:07.930> listed<00:06:08.349> all<00:06:08.560> of<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:09.280> plans

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
that the toy she listed all of the plans

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.700 
that the toy she listed all of the plans
it<00:06:10.120> is<00:06:10.419> possible<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:10.930> we<00:06:11.080> will<00:06:11.260> be<00:06:11.410> getting<00:06:11.530> a

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
it is possible that we will be getting a

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.740 
it is possible that we will be getting a
Voyager<00:06:12.070> swoop<00:06:12.400> that<00:06:12.610> is<00:06:12.789> preferably<00:06:13.300> what<00:06:13.599> we

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
Voyager swoop that is preferably what we

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.890 
Voyager swoop that is preferably what we
will<00:06:14.050> get<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.310> future<00:06:15.729> we<00:06:16.150> have<00:06:16.300> also<00:06:16.539> gotten

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
will get the future we have also gotten

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.430 
will get the future we have also gotten
our<00:06:17.110> first<00:06:17.560> look<00:06:18.520> at<00:06:18.580> Autobot<00:06:19.570> hound<00:06:19.960> I

humanistic look that they've been trying
to<00:06:30.729> do<00:06:30.910> but<00:06:31.419> don't<00:06:31.599> like<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.990> we<00:06:32.229> got<00:06:32.349> our

to do but don't like that we got our

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.620 
to do but don't like that we got our
first<00:06:32.620> look<00:06:32.800> at<00:06:32.949> Hound<00:06:33.250> is<00:06:33.580> robot<00:06:34.419> mode

the bearded look he totally has which we

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.890 
the bearded look he totally has which we
saw<00:06:48.870> back<00:06:49.650> in<00:06:49.680> Detroit<00:06:50.520> which<00:06:51.240> not<00:06:51.630> a<00:06:51.660> lot<00:06:51.780> of

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
saw back in Detroit which not a lot of

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.020 
saw back in Detroit which not a lot of
people<00:06:52.020> liked<00:06:52.470> including<00:06:52.680> me<00:06:53.100> again<00:06:53.430> it<00:06:53.610> was

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
people liked including me again it was

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.020 
people liked including me again it was
that<00:06:54.150> full<00:06:54.450> beard<00:06:54.780> and<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.740> pipe<00:06:56.010> it's<00:06:56.760> not

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
that full beard and the pipe it's not

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.410 
that full beard and the pipe it's not
right<00:06:57.420> but<00:06:58.070> his<00:06:59.070> robot<00:06:59.520> mode<00:06:59.550> actually<00:07:00.240> does

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
right but his robot mode actually does

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.490 
right but his robot mode actually does
look<00:07:00.450> pretty<00:07:00.810> good<00:07:00.930> it's<00:07:01.380> not<00:07:01.940> really<00:07:02.940> fat

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
look pretty good it's not really fat

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.890 
look pretty good it's not really fat
more<00:07:04.500> as<00:07:04.770> he's<00:07:05.100> just<00:07:05.340> extremely<00:07:05.730> bulky<00:07:06.630> it

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
more as he's just extremely bulky it

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.120 
more as he's just extremely bulky it
almost<00:07:07.170> looks<00:07:07.380> like<00:07:07.440> he<00:07:07.560> would<00:07:07.770> be<00:07:07.800> a<00:07:07.920> better

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
almost looks like he would be a better

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.520 
almost looks like he would be a better
bulkhead<00:07:08.730> than<00:07:08.940> a<00:07:08.970> hound<00:07:09.180> so<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.990> think<00:07:10.320> that's

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
bulkhead than a hound so I think that's

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.960 
bulkhead than a hound so I think that's
going<00:07:10.710> to<00:07:10.770> be<00:07:10.860> kind<00:07:10.980> of<00:07:11.070> an<00:07:11.160> interesting<00:07:11.430> take

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
going to be kind of an interesting take

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.290 
going to be kind of an interesting take
on<00:07:12.150> the<00:07:12.270> character<00:07:12.720> so<00:07:13.170> I<00:07:13.680> think<00:07:14.580> that's

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
on the character so I think that's

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.540 
on the character so I think that's
really<00:07:15.600> all<00:07:15.780> I<00:07:15.810> have<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.320> say<00:07:16.350> for<00:07:16.620> now<00:07:16.890> so<00:07:17.370> this

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
really all I have to say for now so this

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.460 
really all I have to say for now so this
probably<00:07:17.850> going<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.060> be<00:07:18.120> the<00:07:18.150> last<00:07:18.480> actual

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
probably going to be the last actual

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.920 
probably going to be the last actual
video<00:07:20.130> update<00:07:20.730> I<00:07:21.000> just<00:07:21.420> want<00:07:21.630> to<00:07:21.690> make<00:07:21.810> this

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
video update I just want to make this

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.200
