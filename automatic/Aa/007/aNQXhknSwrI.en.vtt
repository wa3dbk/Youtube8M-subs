over<00:01:04.059> 108<00:01:05.310> first<00:01:06.310> divide<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.150> by<00:01:07.300> 2<00:01:07.410> 24<00:01:08.410> divided

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
over 108 first divide it by 2 24 divided

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.070 
over 108 first divide it by 2 24 divided
by<00:01:09.250> 2<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.850> 12<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:11.250> 108<00:01:12.250> divided<00:01:12.640> by<00:01:12.850> 2<00:01:12.909> is<00:01:13.300> 54

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
by 2 is 12 and 108 divided by 2 is 54

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.359 
by 2 is 12 and 108 divided by 2 is 54
divide<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.220> 12<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.000> 54<00:01:16.479> again<00:01:16.869> by<00:01:17.200> 2<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
divide the 12 and the 54 again by 2 you

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.340 
divide the 12 and the 54 again by 2 you
get<00:01:18.490> 6<00:01:18.880> over<00:01:19.090> 27<00:01:20.080> now<00:01:20.979> divide<00:01:21.759> by<00:01:22.030> 3<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.720> you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
get 6 over 27 now divide by 3 and you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.969 
get 6 over 27 now divide by 3 and you
get<00:01:23.500> 2<00:01:23.800> ninths

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
get 2 ninths

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.899 
get 2 ninths
here<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.969> another<00:01:27.450> example<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.310> divide<00:01:29.610> by

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
here is another example can we divide by

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.469 
here is another example can we divide by
2

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
2

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
2
yes<00:01:31.759> how<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:33.060> 2<00:01:33.450> again

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
yes how about 2 again

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
yes how about 2 again
no<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:36.179> 21<00:01:36.929> can't<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.560> evenly<00:01:38.039> divided<00:01:38.399> by

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
no because 21 can't be evenly divided by

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.410 
no because 21 can't be evenly divided by
2<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.320> 10<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.679> a<00:01:41.039> half<00:01:41.420> how

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
2 as you would get 10 and a half how

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.779 
2 as you would get 10 and a half how
about<00:01:42.750> 3

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
about 3

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:52.730 
about 3
no<00:01:44.789> because<00:01:46.250> 14/3<00:01:47.250> doesn't<00:01:47.970> work<00:01:48.740> how<00:01:49.740> about<00:01:49.819> 5

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
no because 14/3 doesn't work how about 5

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.160 
no because 14/3 doesn't work how about 5
No

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.940 

how<00:01:56.680> about<00:01:57.600> seven<00:01:58.800> yes<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:01.180> are<00:02:01.479> done

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
how about seven yes and we are done
