00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
primarily to sort of keep the team alive

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.599 
primarily to sort of keep the team alive
but<00:01:50.049> also<00:01:50.170> she<00:01:50.350> has<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.560> few<00:01:50.859> other<00:01:51.069> tools<00:01:51.399> in

her<00:01:51.729> box<00:01:51.939> specifically<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:52.990> Val<00:01:53.399> she<00:01:54.399> can't

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
her box specifically for Val she can't

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.910 
her box specifically for Val she can't
rank<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.329> monster<00:01:55.750> which<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.289> great<00:01:56.560> early<00:01:56.890> on

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
rank the monster which is great early on

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.469 
rank the monster which is great early on
during<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.399> hunt<00:01:57.610> because<00:01:57.789> she<00:01:58.060> slows<00:01:58.299> him

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
during the hunt because she slows him

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.899 
during the hunt because she slows him
down<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:59.049> also<00:01:59.679> she<00:01:59.709> highlights<00:02:00.459> the<00:02:00.610> monster

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
down and also she highlights the monster

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.190 
down and also she highlights the monster
within<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.240> world<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.600> everyone<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:01.959> sort

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
within the world so everyone can sort

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.529 
within the world so everyone can sort
follow<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.950> monster<00:02:03.310> there<00:02:03.490> also<00:02:04.240> she<00:02:04.299> has<00:02:04.450> an

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
follow the monster there also she has an

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.730 
follow the monster there also she has an
anti-material<00:02:05.170> rifle<00:02:05.229> now<00:02:05.679> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
anti-material rifle now the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.380 
anti-material rifle now the
anti-material<00:02:06.100> rifle<00:02:06.429> will<00:02:06.759> actually<00:02:07.000> shoot

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
anti-material rifle will actually shoot

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.869 
anti-material rifle will actually shoot
holes<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.170> monsters<00:02:08.530> armor<00:02:08.890> essentially

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
holes in the monsters armor essentially

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.460 
holes in the monsters armor essentially
creating<00:02:10.209> weak<00:02:10.450> spots<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:11.049> everyone's

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
creating weak spots like everyone's

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.720 
creating weak spots like everyone's
probably<00:02:11.650> familiar<00:02:11.890> with<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> weak<00:02:12.459> spots

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
probably familiar with the weak spots

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.220 
probably familiar with the weak spots
that<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.880> getting<00:02:13.120> massive<00:02:13.569> hospitals<00:02:14.110> in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
that you getting massive hospitals in

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140 
that you getting massive hospitals in
other<00:02:14.349> games<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.579> do<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.060> of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
other games so what you do is one of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
other games so what you do is one of
your<00:02:16.269> teammates<00:02:16.599> actually<00:02:17.019> creates<00:02:17.380> those

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
your teammates actually creates those

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920 
your teammates actually creates those
weak<00:02:17.890> spots<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.519> then<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.120> damage<00:02:19.360> dealer

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
weak spots for then the damage dealer

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.930 
weak spots for then the damage dealer
and<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.799> support<00:02:21.310> guy<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> actually<00:02:21.640> take

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and the support guy to actually take

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.670 
and the support guy to actually take
advantage<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.720> more<00:02:22.930> damage<00:02:23.140> one<00:02:23.470> here

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
advantage and do more damage one here

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
advantage and do more damage one here
and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:24.579> the<00:02:24.760> fourth<00:02:25.060> class<00:02:26.019> is<00:02:26.260> probably

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and then the fourth class is probably

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.039 
and then the fourth class is probably
the<00:02:26.620> most<00:02:26.650> unique<00:02:27.099> class<00:02:27.489> for<00:02:27.970> evolve<00:02:28.900> and

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
the most unique class for evolve and

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.710 
the most unique class for evolve and
that<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.470> trapper<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> really<00:02:31.510> great

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
that is the trapper now a really great

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
that is the trapper now a really great
trapper<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.290> our<00:02:32.410> game<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.950> actually<00:02:33.250> control

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
trapper in our game can actually control

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.020 
trapper in our game can actually control
the<00:02:33.700> ebb<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:33.970> flow<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.569> game<00:02:34.599> very<00:02:35.110> well

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the ebb and flow of the game very well

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.940 
the ebb and flow of the game very well
he's<00:02:37.030> responsible<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.840> finding<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.530> monster

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
he's responsible for finding the monster

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.680 
he's responsible for finding the monster
initially<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.879> then<00:02:39.940> holding<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.390> monster

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690

characters they've all got headsets on

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.730 
characters they've all got headsets on
they're<00:05:23.720> going<00:05:23.870> to<00:05:23.930> humanely<00:05:24.350> get<00:05:24.560> well

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
they're going to humanely get well

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.840 
they're going to humanely get well
hopefully<00:05:24.980> they're<00:05:25.340> going<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.520> communicate

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
hopefully they're going to communicate

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.850 
hopefully they're going to communicate
way<00:05:26.390> better<00:05:26.630> than<00:05:26.810> ever<00:05:26.990> we<00:05:27.230> could<00:05:27.470> do<00:05:27.650> with

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
way better than ever we could do with

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.380 
way better than ever we could do with
the<00:05:27.950> game<00:05:28.130> but<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.670> lot<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
the game but a lot of the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.820 
the game but a lot of the
characterization<00:05:30.140> as<00:05:30.230> well<00:05:30.380> will<00:05:30.590> come

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
characterization as well will come

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.560 
characterization as well will come
through<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.070> video<00:05:31.460> much<00:05:32.000> like<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.330> didn't

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
through that video much like it didn't

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.810 
through that video much like it didn't
lift<00:05:32.690> it
