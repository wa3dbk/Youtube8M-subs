before<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:03.210> create<00:00:03.480> an<00:00:03.659> animation<00:00:04.020> it's

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
before you create an animation it's

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.070 
before you create an animation it's
important<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.040> understand<00:00:05.550> how<00:00:05.910> frames<00:00:06.450> work

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
important to understand how frames work

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.570 
important to understand how frames work
in<00:00:07.260> this<00:00:07.529> movie<00:00:07.769> we'll<00:00:07.890> take<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> look<00:00:08.400> at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
in this movie we'll take a look at

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
in this movie we'll take a look at
frames<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.720> tell<00:00:09.900> which<00:00:10.139> frames

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
frames and how you can tell which frames

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290 
frames and how you can tell which frames
you're<00:00:10.830> looking<00:00:11.160> at<00:00:11.340> through<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> timeline

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you're looking at through the timeline

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.970 
you're looking at through the timeline
so<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.810> the<00:00:12.900> timeline<00:00:13.350> you<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.950> I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
so in the timeline you can see that I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.530 
so in the timeline you can see that I
have<00:00:14.190> an<00:00:14.310> animation<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.060> if<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.210> scrub<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
have an animation and if I scrub the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.050 
have an animation and if I scrub the
playhead<00:00:15.930> by<00:00:16.260> clicking<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.800> dragging<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
playhead by clicking and dragging it you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.210 
playhead by clicking and dragging it you
can<00:00:18.269> preview<00:00:18.599> the<00:00:18.869> animation<00:00:18.990> you'll<00:00:19.890> notice

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
can preview the animation you'll notice

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.870 
can preview the animation you'll notice
that<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.429> are<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.519> bunch<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.820> different

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that there are a bunch of different

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
that there are a bunch of different
icons<00:00:21.839> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> timeline<00:00:22.949> these<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.669> visual

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
icons in the timeline these are visual

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.179 
icons in the timeline these are visual
cues<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.839> show<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.259> what<00:00:25.499> type<00:00:25.679> of<00:00:25.710> frames

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
cues to show you what type of frames

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.370 
cues to show you what type of frames
you're<00:00:26.460> working<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.150> flash<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
you're working with in flash so the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.639 
you're working with in flash so the
black<00:00:28.619> dots<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.279> called<00:00:30.119> key<00:00:30.720> frames<00:00:31.079> these

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
black dots are called key frames these

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.670 
black dots are called key frames these
specify<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> change<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.329> artwork<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.410> every

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
specify a change in artwork so every

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380 
specify a change in artwork so every
time<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.220> want<00:00:35.400> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.580> a<00:00:35.610> change<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.270> your

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
time you want to make a change in your

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
time you want to make a change in your
animation<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.080> create<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> keyframe<00:00:37.830> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
animation you can create a keyframe and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
animation you can create a keyframe and
you<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.730> control<00:00:39.180> over<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.900> artwork

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you have control over what the artwork

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
you have control over what the artwork
looks<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.830> in<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.070> frame<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:41.640> you'll<00:00:42.150> see

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
looks like in that frame so you'll see

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.050 
looks like in that frame so you'll see
again<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.990> keyframe<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.740> black<00:00:44.190> dot<00:00:44.490> with<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
again for keyframe a black dot with a

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.050 
again for keyframe a black dot with a
gray<00:00:45.330> background<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:46.050> regular<00:00:46.980> frame<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
gray background a regular frame has a

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.450 
gray background a regular frame has a
gray<00:00:48.330> background<00:00:48.540> with<00:00:49.320> nothing<00:00:49.740> else<00:00:49.830> it<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
gray background with nothing else it so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.980 
gray background with nothing else it so
on<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.790> girl<00:00:51.000> layer<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.450> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
on the girl layer you can see that

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.720 
on the girl layer you can see that
there's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.200> keyframe<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.340> frame

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there's a keyframe on the first frame

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
there's a keyframe on the first frame
but<00:00:54.450> through<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> rest<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:54.990> the<00:00:55.110> layer<00:00:55.320> you'll

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
but through the rest of the layer you'll

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
but through the rest of the layer you'll
only<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.250> regular<00:00:56.700> frames

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
only see regular frames

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
only see regular frames
hence<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> gray<00:00:58.230> background<00:00:58.610> regular<00:00:59.610> frames

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
hence the gray background regular frames

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
hence the gray background regular frames
indicate<00:01:00.780> no<00:01:01.200> change<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> artwork<00:01:02.040> from<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
indicate no change in artwork from the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600 
indicate no change in artwork from the
last<00:01:03.000> keyframe<00:01:03.630> so<00:01:04.079> I<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:05.009> go<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> any<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
last keyframe so I can go to any of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.460 
last keyframe so I can go to any of
these<00:01:05.790> frames<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> girl<00:01:06.780> layer<00:01:07.080> let's<00:01:07.320> say

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
these frames in the girl layer let's say

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
these frames in the girl layer let's say
I<00:01:07.500> hide<00:01:07.830> everything<00:01:08.280> else<00:01:08.460> except<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
I hide everything else except for the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
I hide everything else except for the
girl<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.710> scrub<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.190> playhead<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:12.000> you'll

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
girl I can scrub the playhead and you'll

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
girl I can scrub the playhead and you'll
notice<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.480> there<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:12.990> change<00:01:13.470> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
notice that there is no change in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.130 
notice that there is no change in
artwork<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.090> last<00:01:15.330> frame<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.870> girl

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
artwork on the last frame of the girl

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
artwork on the last frame of the girl
layer<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.620> throughout<00:01:17.370> my<00:01:17.640> timeline<00:01:18.180> you'll

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
layer and throughout my timeline you'll

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
layer and throughout my timeline you'll
see<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> gray<00:01:19.229> background<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> white

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
see a gray background with a white

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.670 
see a gray background with a white
rectangle<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.420> indicates<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.440> last

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
regular frame before a change so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
regular frame before a change so
whenever<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.360> reach<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> end<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.560> set<00:01:28.740> of

a<00:01:31.650> keyframe<00:01:32.100> you'll<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> gray

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a keyframe you'll see this gray

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.000 
a keyframe you'll see this gray
background<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.870> white<00:01:33.930> square<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.830> just

background with a white square but just

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.190 
background with a white square but just
know<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> regular<00:01:36.330> frame<00:01:36.690> the

know that it's just a regular frame the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.230 
know that it's just a regular frame the
other<00:01:37.380> types<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> frames<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.490> blank

keyframes and blank frames these are

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
keyframes and blank frames these are
pretty<00:01:42.390> similar<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.140> regular<00:01:43.590> keyframes<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
pretty similar to regular keyframes and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
pretty similar to regular keyframes and
regular<00:01:45.180> frames<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.260> watch<00:01:46.470> my

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
regular frames if you just watch my

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
regular frames if you just watch my
screen<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.240> add<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> blank<00:01:48.840> keyframe

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
screen I'm going to add a blank keyframe

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
screen I'm going to add a blank keyframe
to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> timeline<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.250> background<00:01:50.670> layer

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
to the timeline in the background layer

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
to the timeline in the background layer
you'll<00:01:51.360> notice<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> artwork

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you'll notice that all the artwork

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
you'll notice that all the artwork
disappeared<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> point<00:01:53.700> where<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> added

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
disappeared at the point where I added

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.750 
disappeared at the point where I added
the<00:01:54.240> blank<00:01:54.450> keyframe<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.490> stage

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
the blank keyframe so it's on this stage

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760 
the blank keyframe so it's on this stage
all<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> way<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.510> till<00:01:57.630> frame<00:01:57.900> 7<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.470> then<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
all the way up till frame 7 and then the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
all the way up till frame 7 and then the
background<00:01:58.979> simply<00:01:59.520> disappears<00:02:00.210> that's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
background simply disappears that's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.929 
background simply disappears that's
because<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> created<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.680> blank<00:02:02.100> keyframe<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
because I created a blank keyframe that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.420 
because I created a blank keyframe that
means<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.360> key<00:02:03.810> frame<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.290> no<00:02:04.320> artwork<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
means a key frame with no artwork in it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
means a key frame with no artwork in it
you<00:02:05.970> can<00:02:06.119> tell<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> keyframe<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> blank

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you can tell that a keyframe is a blank

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.589 
you can tell that a keyframe is a blank
keyframe<00:02:07.759> because<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.909> has<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> white

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
keyframe because it has a white

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.140 
keyframe because it has a white
background<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.770> black<00:02:11.039> outline<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
background and the black outline of a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.470 
background and the black outline of a
circle<00:02:12.480> blank<00:02:13.260> frames<00:02:13.819> indicate<00:02:14.819> no<00:02:15.060> change

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
circle blank frames indicate no change

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.980 
circle blank frames indicate no change
in<00:02:15.630> our

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
in our

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.930 
in our
just<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.350> regular<00:02:16.560> frames<00:02:17.070> but<00:02:17.760> they're

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just like regular frames but they're

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
just like regular frames but they're
white<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.690> background<00:02:18.810> indicating<00:02:19.800> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
white in the background indicating that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
white in the background indicating that
there's<00:02:20.070> also<00:02:20.310> no<00:02:20.850> artwork<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.600> those<00:02:21.870> frames

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
there's also no artwork on those frames

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.260 
there's also no artwork on those frames
so<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.100> scrub<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> playhead<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.940> preview

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
so I can scrub the playhead to preview

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.090 
so I can scrub the playhead to preview
that<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.660> no<00:02:24.870> artwork<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.560> any<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.980> these

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that there is no artwork on any of these

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.340 
that there is no artwork on any of these
frames<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> finally<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.660> see<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> white

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
frames and finally when you see a white

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.470 
frames and finally when you see a white
rectangle<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> white<00:02:29.340> background<00:02:29.610> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
rectangle with a white background that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320 
rectangle with a white background that
indicates<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> last<00:02:31.500> blank<00:02:32.130> frame<00:02:32.520> before<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
indicates the last blank frame before a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.920 
indicates the last blank frame before a
change

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
change

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.730 
change
so<00:02:34.320> again<00:02:34.620> black<00:02:35.280> dot<00:02:35.610> means<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.270> keyframe<00:02:36.740> gray

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so again black dot means a keyframe gray

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.010 
so again black dot means a keyframe gray
background<00:02:38.010> means<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.700> regular<00:02:39.060> frame<00:02:39.390> white

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
background means a regular frame white

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.200 
background means a regular frame white
box<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:41.010> gray<00:02:41.190> background<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> last

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
box and a gray background is the last

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.570 
box and a gray background is the last
regular<00:02:42.480> frame<00:02:42.930> before<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.320> change<00:02:43.620> white

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
regular frame before a change white

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
circle is a blank keyframe white

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.370 
circle is a blank keyframe white
background<00:02:49.860> only<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:51.270> blank<00:02:51.690> frame<00:02:51.960> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
background only is a blank frame and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.680
