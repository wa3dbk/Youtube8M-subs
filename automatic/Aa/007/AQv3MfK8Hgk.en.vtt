00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
that having a really good trainer is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.069 
that having a really good trainer is
very<00:01:57.890> important<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.659> what<00:01:59.960> I<00:01:59.990> really

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
very important I think what I really

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.960 
very important I think what I really
liked<00:02:00.560> about<00:02:00.619> our<00:02:00.860> low<00:02:01.039> first<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.460> all<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.939> that

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
liked about our low first of all is that

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.969 
liked about our low first of all is that
it's<00:02:02.450> very<00:02:02.659> fun<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.409> train<00:02:03.649> here<00:02:03.920> at

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
it's very fun to train here at

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.460 
it's very fun to train here at
competitive<00:02:04.310> edge<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:05.360> think<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.840> he<00:02:05.990> finds

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
competitive edge I think that he finds

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.109 
competitive edge I think that he finds
things<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:06.979> push<00:02:07.189> me<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.610> way<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:07.759> would

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
things that push me in a way I would

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.440 
things that push me in a way I would
never<00:02:08.330> know<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.989> push<00:02:09.349> myself<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.269> think

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
never know to push myself and I think

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
never know to push myself and I think
most<00:02:11.630> importantly<00:02:12.080> because<00:02:12.410> I'm<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.590> doctor<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
most importantly because I'm a doctor I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.470 
most importantly because I'm a doctor I
work<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.250> lot<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.880> need<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> workout

work a lot and so I need a workout
that's<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:14.930> efficient<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.530> don't<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> lot

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that's very efficient I don't have a lot

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.490 
that's very efficient I don't have a lot
of<00:02:16.190> time<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.700> waste<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.840> come<00:02:18.140> into<00:02:18.319> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of time to waste and so I come into a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.350 
of time to waste and so I come into a
competitive<00:02:18.980> edge<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.459> few<00:02:19.819> times<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.180> week

about<00:02:58.080> our<00:02:58.290> load<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.480> he<00:03:00.480> really<00:03:00.629> knows

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
about our load is that he really knows

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.539 
about our load is that he really knows
his<00:03:01.140> stuff<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.769> sense<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.310> get<00:03:02.519> a

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
his stuff in the sense that I get a

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.000 
his stuff in the sense that I get a
complete<00:03:03.000> body<00:03:03.330> workout<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.620> fairly<00:03:04.860> short

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
complete body workout in a fairly short

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.710 
complete body workout in a fairly short
period<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.459> time<00:03:05.549> meaning<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.150> an<00:03:06.239> hour<00:03:06.420> we

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
period of time meaning in an hour we

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.800 
period of time meaning in an hour we
work<00:03:06.900> or<00:03:07.290> upper<00:03:07.980> body<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.580> lower<00:03:08.879> body<00:03:09.000> which

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
work or upper body and lower body which

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.680 
work or upper body and lower body which
is<00:03:09.840> exactly<00:03:10.290> what<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.530> need<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:12.150> he

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
is exactly what I need I think that he

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.539 
is exactly what I need I think that he
figured<00:03:13.049> out<00:03:13.170> very<00:03:13.769> early<00:03:14.069> on<00:03:14.099> than<00:03:14.370> what<00:03:14.459> my

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
figured out very early on than what my

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.759 
figured out very early on than what my
weaknesses<00:03:15.030> are<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.420> we've<00:03:16.410> been<00:03:16.560> targeting

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
weaknesses are and we've been targeting

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.339 
weaknesses are and we've been targeting
those<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:17.910> working<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.360> making

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
those and really working on making

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.440 
those and really working on making
particularly<00:03:19.799> upper<00:03:20.129> body<00:03:20.340> stronger<00:03:20.849> for<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
particularly upper body stronger for the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.729 
particularly upper body stronger for the
climbs<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.049> doing<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.530> most

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
climbs that I'm doing and most

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.960 
climbs that I'm doing and most
importantly<00:03:23.129> we<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> really

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
importantly we just we have a really

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:50.640 
importantly we just we have a really
good<00:03:24.060> time<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.450> laugh<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:25.110> lot

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.699 

let's<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.920> um<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:53.110> think<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.319> other<00:03:54.439> amazing

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
let's see um I think the other amazing

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.710 
let's see um I think the other amazing
thing<00:03:55.069> about<00:03:55.159> Arlo<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.879> he<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> 48<00:03:56.540> inch

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
thing about Arlo is that he is a 48 inch

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.600 
thing about Arlo is that he is a 48 inch
vertical<00:03:57.170> jump<00:03:59.170> hey<00:04:00.170> that's<00:04:00.439> not<00:04:00.590> even<00:04:00.980> true<00:04:01.189> I

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
vertical jump hey that's not even true I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:23.010 
vertical jump hey that's not even true I
mean<00:04:01.790> he's<00:04:01.909> got<00:04:02.060> up<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> 52

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900 

so<00:04:24.020> when<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.710> come<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.889> competitive<00:04:25.370> edge<00:04:25.490> it's

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
so when I come to competitive edge it's

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.520 
so when I come to competitive edge it's
usually<00:04:26.210> an<00:04:26.509> hour<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.050> did<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.350> couple

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
usually an hour and I did that a couple

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.680 
usually an hour and I did that a couple
of<00:04:27.620> times<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.949> week<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:29.030> start<00:04:29.300> with<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.479> little

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
of times a week we start with a little

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.680 
of times a week we start with a little
bit<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.460> stretching<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:32.270> for<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.419> few<00:04:32.570> minutes

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
bit of stretching just for a few minutes

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.150 
bit of stretching just for a few minutes
and<00:04:33.020> they<00:04:33.080> go<00:04:33.199> then<00:04:33.500> go<00:04:33.650> into<00:04:33.770> circuit

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
and they go then go into circuit

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.240 
and they go then go into circuit
training<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:34.759> usually<00:04:35.090> what<00:04:35.270> we'll<00:04:35.419> do<00:04:35.570> is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
training so usually what we'll do is

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.800 
training so usually what we'll do is
we'll<00:04:37.250> pick<00:04:37.550> or<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.000> know<00:04:38.060> he<00:04:38.240> will<00:04:38.389> pick<00:04:38.570> for

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
we'll pick or you know he will pick for

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.570 
we'll pick or you know he will pick for
me<00:04:38.960> anywhere<00:04:39.620> from<00:04:39.680> three<00:04:40.009> to<00:04:40.039> five<00:04:40.130> exercises

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
me anywhere from three to five exercises

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.270 
me anywhere from three to five exercises
and<00:04:41.210> we<00:04:41.630> do<00:04:41.780> them<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.289> a<00:04:42.320> circuit<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.070> we'll

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
and we do them in a circuit so we'll

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.760 
and we do them in a circuit so we'll
repeat<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.120> circuit<00:04:44.419> maybe<00:04:44.840> four<00:04:45.620> or<00:04:45.650> five

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
repeat that circuit maybe four or five

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.900 
repeat that circuit maybe four or five
times<00:04:45.949> and<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.810> idea<00:04:48.110> really<00:04:49.039> is<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.370> get

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
times and so the idea really is to get

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.640 
times and so the idea really is to get
kind<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.330> total<00:04:50.630> body<00:04:50.750> workout<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:54.139> so<00:04:54.470> to

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
kind of a total body workout and so to

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.110 
kind of a total body workout and so to
me<00:04:54.770> that's<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.130> most<00:04:55.280> efficient<00:04:55.789> way<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.910> do

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
me that's the most efficient way to do

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.020 
me that's the most efficient way to do
it<00:04:56.240> we're<00:04:56.389> constantly<00:04:56.780> moving<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:58.669> actually

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
it we're constantly moving it actually

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.279 
it we're constantly moving it actually
ends<00:04:59.240> up<00:04:59.300> being<00:04:59.360> quite<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.780> good<00:04:59.990> aerobic

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
ends up being quite a good aerobic

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:22.770 
ends up being quite a good aerobic
workout<00:05:00.770> as<00:05:01.010> well<00:05:01.039> as<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> stranger

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.060 

and<00:05:23.780> what's<00:05:23.990> your<00:05:24.110> favorite<00:05:24.410> exercising<00:05:24.980> as

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
and what's your favorite exercising as

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.300 
and what's your favorite exercising as
you<00:05:25.190> do<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.710> hard<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.250> choose<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:30.530> have<00:05:30.770> actually

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
you do so hard to choose I have actually

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.020 
you do so hard to choose I have actually
become<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:32.770> surprising<00:05:33.770> fan<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.370> pull-ups<00:05:34.790> and

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
become a surprising fan of pull-ups and

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.360 
become a surprising fan of pull-ups and
that<00:05:35.840> has<00:05:36.050> been<00:05:36.260> one<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.470> my<00:05:36.560> weaknesses<00:05:37.100> and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
that has been one of my weaknesses and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.820 
that has been one of my weaknesses and
so<00:05:37.580> what<00:05:37.760> our<00:05:37.880> Lowe<00:05:38.120> has<00:05:38.330> done<00:05:38.570> is<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.260> will<00:05:39.680> do

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
so what our Lowe has done is I will do

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.030 
so what our Lowe has done is I will do
pull-ups<00:05:40.130> with<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:41.180> an<00:05:41.990> elastic<00:05:42.560> band<00:05:42.740> around

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
pull-ups with a an elastic band around

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.340 
pull-ups with a an elastic band around
the<00:05:43.250> bar<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:44.000> it<00:05:44.270> started<00:05:44.660> out<00:05:44.780> as<00:05:44.930> very<00:05:45.110> thick

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
the bar and it started out as very thick

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.450 
the bar and it started out as very thick
band<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:45.830> was<00:05:45.980> getting<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.280> lot<00:05:46.400> of

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
band so I was getting a lot of

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.160 
band so I was getting a lot of
assistance<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.090> I've<00:05:47.420> gotten<00:05:47.690> stronger<00:05:47.990> it

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
assistance and I've gotten stronger it

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.990 
assistance and I've gotten stronger it
gets<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.530> thinner<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:48.980> thinner<00:05:49.130> bar<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
gets to a thinner and thinner bar to the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.220 
gets to a thinner and thinner bar to the
point<00:05:50.180> where<00:05:50.270> I<00:05:50.300> could<00:05:50.540> actually<00:05:50.660> do<00:05:51.020> pull-ups

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
point where I could actually do pull-ups
