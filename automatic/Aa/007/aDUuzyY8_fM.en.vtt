00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.590 

hmm<00:02:11.450> ok<00:02:12.450> night<00:02:12.660> before<00:02:14.150> trying<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.209> do<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.480> of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
hmm ok night before trying to do some of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:25.220 
hmm ok night before trying to do some of
that<00:02:15.660> be<00:02:16.140> four<00:02:16.170> square<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:24.110> think<00:02:25.110> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that be four square right I think I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.870 
that be four square right I think I
should<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.470> six<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.890> will<00:02:25.920> sort<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.459> d5

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
should be six it will sort out the d5

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.410 
should be six it will sort out the d5
square<00:02:27.630> issue<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.670> know<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> double

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
square issue I know I get the double

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.820 
square issue I know I get the double
corns<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.020> um<00:02:31.280> maybe<00:02:32.280> I've<00:02:32.459> got<00:02:32.640> some<00:02:32.819> dynamic

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
corns but um maybe I've got some dynamic

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:43.699 
corns but um maybe I've got some dynamic
compensation<00:02:34.830> now<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.370> rook<00:02:41.520> c8<00:02:42.709> maybes

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
compensation now right so rook c8 maybes

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.800 
compensation now right so rook c8 maybes
comes<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> see<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:46.940> they'll<00:02:47.940> maybe<00:02:48.120> 90<00:02:48.480> frame

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
comes to see to they'll maybe 90 frame

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:00.960 
comes to see to they'll maybe 90 frame
on<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.800> form

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
mmm as unite c2 to d4 may be as well to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.640

shrine<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:04.970> double<00:03:05.239> pawns<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:06.349> could<00:03:06.530> be<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
shrine on double pawns that could be a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.580 
shrine on double pawns that could be a
good<00:03:06.680> idea<00:03:08.049> yeah<00:03:13.900> all<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.019> we'll<00:03:15.200> see<00:03:15.379> too

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
good idea yeah all right we'll see too

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.860

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
eight or is it getting to be a busted

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.630 
eight or is it getting to be a busted
position<00:03:36.640> now<00:03:38.680> if<00:03:39.680> we're<00:03:39.829> all<00:03:39.890> good<00:03:40.010> ac1<00:03:40.459> maybe

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
position now if we're all good ac1 maybe

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.509 
position now if we're all good ac1 maybe
rock<00:03:40.910> takes<00:03:41.150> f<00:03:41.329> 2<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.739> rook<00:03:42.920> takes<00:03:43.099> root<00:03:43.340> see

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
rock takes f 2 so rook takes root see

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:54.580 
rock takes f 2 so rook takes root see
one<00:03:47.230> right<00:03:48.849> um<00:03:52.150> okay<00:03:53.150> pick<00:03:53.780> up<00:03:53.900> over<00:03:54.140> here<00:03:54.319> to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
one right um okay pick up over here to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.949 
one right um okay pick up over here to
stop<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.099> use<00:03:55.159> of<00:03:55.220> c1

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:10.890 

hmm

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:24.050 

right<00:04:12.489> um

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.320 

thinking<00:04:25.060> lots

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.469 

so<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:33.009> this<00:04:33.189> tricky<00:04:33.639> for<00:04:33.789> why<00:04:33.909> what<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.449> he

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
so is this tricky for why what is he

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:41.879 
so is this tricky for why what is he
thinking<00:04:34.569> about

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.149 

I<00:04:42.330> mean<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.449> difficult<00:04:43.810> from<00:04:44.169> an<00:04:44.499> actual<00:04:44.740> plan

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
I mean it difficult from an actual plan

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.820 
I mean it difficult from an actual plan
for<00:04:45.460> white<00:04:45.610> from<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.840> night<00:04:47.409> Spokane<00:04:47.800> and

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
really sure okay maybe that checks

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.100 
really sure okay maybe that checks
useful<00:04:59.560> or<00:04:59.680> don't<00:04:59.919> know<00:05:00.389> we've<00:05:01.389> got<00:05:01.569> just<00:05:01.659> a<00:05:01.779> g5

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
useful or don't know we've got just a g5
