00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.559
 the best youtube people welcome to 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.080
 episode 27 of the minecraft 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:16.689
 survival guide 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.259
 and today we are going to have a small survival 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.259
 take a ride 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:30.009
 what do we need gold in order to 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:39.060
 to be precise we have and if necessary 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:39.060
 8 need two pieces of redstone 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 16 pieces of paper 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.170
 camping cupboard also labeled a bit 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.840
 with just live the drinks ingredients 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:03.760
 traces the book ii 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:07.530
 remaining mess on wooden blocks of stones 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.970
 block have a carved wooden point 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.720
 looks a lot nicer than that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 boring signs 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:22.060
 ok what are we going to make first 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.190
 first we make order according to me 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.190
 You don't need 8 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 No 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.049
 the virata 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 we then get a compass with gold 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.409
 I got a whole clock from the button one 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.720
 ok and so here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.380
 set a game apart exactly 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.869
 so later on or you know your hand 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.869
 but that does not have much net 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 then the compass 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 yes the compass i actually have no idea 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.380
 what points to it because it would point 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.550
 to where you normally are too full 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.190
 divorce 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.019
 now that he do some people 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.730
 say it points to the place of 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.590
 for a while asleep but that's right 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.489
 not but that points to where you are 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.410
 started 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.410
 so here we started at this place 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.590
 the arrow goes completely crazy 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.480
 that's the camp like 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:05.420
 then I will show something like me 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:09.500
 came down you can both day and you 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.220
 for example, you tell your clock in your skin 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.220
 hanging on the wall 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.270
 that is also nice 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.980
 you can always senses so later 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.980
 because you keep working 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 just the redstone back we go that way 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.760
 on 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.520
 again what i want to see with this is it 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.520
 compass 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.960
 package and paper and what do we get 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.960
 blank card 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.110
 I think that would be nice if people were home and stuff 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.790
 is in the middle so I put the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.520
 card the fox does not draw and becomes 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.010
 map from here to the outside 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.930
 extended and tmap 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.380
 right click and we have the folder 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.380
 taking free 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 so we watch see the railroad 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.760
 below a mountain goal is going to see my 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.140
 cottage 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.140
 garden some mushroom garden 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:33.170
 and behind it see my fall or not 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.170
 no, not that case 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.950
 brody star 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.410
 what we can do with the card 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:56.520
 specially press you grab him one 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.480
 once extra in a paper and normal 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.480
 would you play cards 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:06.900
 should be bigger no idea why it 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:09.800
 not now so it does n't matter either 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.800
 so much out 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.960
 also ask for 12 that doesn't do that to me 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.880
 can also hang on the wall between fun 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.880
 painting map of your world 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:31.290
 or those that hang directly here I think now 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:34.010
 I immediately earn one quickly 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.010
 list from here 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.490
 so we can see what time it is 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.190
 such a wedding card actually 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.190
 hang up 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:18.080
 yes yes grab one 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.949
 I hope I see the 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.330
 get to see the card instead of the whole 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:33.240
 the logo of card 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.720
 ok for find nice place 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.560
 Well here just before you head out yet 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560
 just take a look 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.680
 dart is high that I can 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.680
 to do 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:54.270
 yes not on the card 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:02.640
 and what i think i'm going to do is one 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:05.450
 Making the wall a guess because now 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.450
 maybe just to do it 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:20.769
 no no I will go for another 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:28.809
 Turn the faucet which is also directed upwards 

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:31.089
 may this was a fairly short episode 

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:34.719
 once the head was made you have a clock 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:38.429
 face and we have charted 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:38.429
 little adventurer kit 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:47.129
 that was a fairly short episode until now 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:47.129
 responds to so I say to the next
