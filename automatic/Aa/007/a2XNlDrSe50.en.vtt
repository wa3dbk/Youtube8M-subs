00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello friends today I love you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.450
 teach how to make this wonderful 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.190
 star with super duo account let's go to 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.190
 see the material we need 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.289
 The first thing we will need is going to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 be a piece of nylon or denim thread 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.230
 or 0 20 millimeters thick too 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.780
 we will use rocayo miyuki of 2 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.449
 millimeters beads super tube in the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 color or colors that you like and we 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.370
 we will help with a needle and scissors 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.370
 Well let's see how to do it 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.300
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.089
 row 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.990
 five super duo accounts alternated with 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.780
 five pebbles 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.270
 we take everything to an extreme of and what 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 we put the needle back through all the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 accounts we get the thread for the first 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 account and now we can level up 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.240
 if we have already formed a kind of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.000
 star in the second level what 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.090
 let's go doing is going to two 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.660
 super duo accounts between the super tubes 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.450
 that we already had placed we lined up two 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.230
 accounts and we went through the hole 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230
 The next 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.270
 you see that it is very simple 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.950
 and once we get to the end what 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.540
 let's do is go back up level 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:03.980
 and line 3 pebbles we will go 3 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.050
 rocallas / super duo and super duo 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.810
 and in the super tube that are more 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.320
 We will be monitoring a new 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.770
 super duo so we'll be alternating three 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.000
 rockers a super or three rockets a 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.070
 super lugo 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.070
 and the entire periphery 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.970
 and once we get to the end what 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's do is pass the thread for a 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.300
 rockery for the first one that remains 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 placed 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.980
 and now we are going to make the little tips of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.520
 the stars for it in a row we will give 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.250
 three new rocks and we'll get back out 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.850
 the thread by the first pebbles of the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.880
 next group in this way we go back 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.040
 to take three rocks and pass the thread 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.440
 for the next one and you can see how they are doing 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.780
 leaving the little pits 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.500
 we will do this around all the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.500
 star 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.590
 two 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.770
 and when we get to the last one and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.380
 we can put the threads together as I say 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.180
 always sewing a bit the structure 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.840
 of the star so that we have more 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.200
 firm and once we get to count 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 the threads we can give a couple of knots 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.850
 hide them and cut them and now 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.590
 we would have prepared can serve us 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.560
 for a lot of creations like 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.790
 hanging earrings keychains all 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.790
 what comes to mind 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.320

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.540
