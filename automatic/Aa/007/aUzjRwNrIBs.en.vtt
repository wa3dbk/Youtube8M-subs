 the recipe debate pauthe varsi in 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.410
 mini version these are rolls 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 to make mines and sandwiches they 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 are especially appreciated in less than 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.590
 Ramadan because it is eaten in small 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 bites and without declining to infinity 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.010
 since you can keep them 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 when you wish I leave you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.130
 discover the preparation in a robot

 mix the yeast flour with 1 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.269
 teaspoon of powdered sugar 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 the latter is a source of nutrition 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 for the the swears and constitutes a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.129
 important ingredient for the process 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.200
 from breeding the dough a pinch of salt 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 here salt is not only there for 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.730
 give the pines a taste but the rules 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.730
 if the activity of the yeast delivering the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 firmer and compact dough of great 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 spoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.860
 who will give taste and croc a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.860
 other paste 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.450
 add little by little water thing that 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.370
 you must know when you add 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 water to our flour and their formation 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.590
 of gluten and air is trapped which 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.460
 allows our paw to lift especially 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 with warm water 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.080
 this year after starting up 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.180
 your robot check if the ball of dough 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280
 or is suitable ie the dough should 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.450
 look like a round, smooth ball 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.940
 and elastic 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.030
 cover your paw with a clean towel 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.160
 and let the dough rest for one hour if 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 possible in a temperature place 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.220
 ambient 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.410
 and formed several pellets with the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.410
 paste obtained the size of a peach 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.569
 then to piss each portion a little 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.200
 disc a few millimeters 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 thick 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.099
 remember to close the labor camp 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.510
 so that the rolls do not stick 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.340
 to have mini bad mood more 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.739
 presentable with a cookie cutter 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.940
 tried to cut your dough to have 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.940
 identical discs 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.890
 and cook your mini bacbotte 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.840
 obtained on both sides on a frying pan 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 nonstick is hot 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.560
 in general the boots boots conflict 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.600
 during cooking 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.400
 in any case I prefer them well 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.870
 inflated it allows to stuff them 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 easily it is also possible to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 let the pitas rise again before 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.390
 the cooking 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.610
 so she makes herself thicker and 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.510
 points then be open and win at 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.450
 inside after cooking in Morocco 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.360
 to make his legs pout often 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.640
 uses a measure of fine semolina and 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.350
 a measure of flour and as you 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.769
 have noticed I used that of the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.110
 flour 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.510
 this will join the pizza recipe 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.910
 or what is called and not Greek 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.250
 when I had explained to you to stuff 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.110
 your mini fault vote goes back to your 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.190
 clean go now for those who 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 lack imagination 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.260
 I propose mine I chose from 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.750
 time with tomato sauce and peas 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.750
 goat cheese and an onion 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.600
 the advantage of cmu and macbook can be enjoyed 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.820
 as cold as hot so that's the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.190
