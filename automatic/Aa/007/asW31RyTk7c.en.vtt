something<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.790> should

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
something like that but i think i should

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
something like that but i think i should
get<00:01:39.060> flap<00:01:39.560> flappity<00:01:40.560> flap<00:01:40.890> flap<00:01:41.159> flap<00:01:41.189> flap<00:01:42.259> or

get flap flappity flap flap flap flap or

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
get flap flappity flap flap flap flap or
is<00:01:43.439> where<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> start<00:01:44.220> doing<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.700> brilliant

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
is where I start doing my brilliant

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
is where I start doing my brilliant
strategy<00:01:45.869> even<00:01:46.470> though<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> said<00:01:46.829> no

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
strategy even though I said no

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
strategy even though I said no
strategies<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.180> trick

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
strategies it's just like a little trick

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.719 
strategies it's just like a little trick
that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:49.220> basically<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> early<00:01:50.700> rounds

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that I do basically in the early rounds

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.749 
that I do basically in the early rounds
and<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.610> little

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and it's just going up on this little

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
and it's just going up on this little
bridge<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.689> flowering<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
bridge here and in flowering them to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.560 
bridge here and in flowering them to
death<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> dive<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:57.030> top<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> them

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
death just off and dive on top of them

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
death just off and dive on top of them
it<00:01:57.689> doesn't<00:01:57.840> work<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.229> later<00:01:58.409> rounds<00:01:58.590> because

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it doesn't work the later rounds because

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.800 
it doesn't work the later rounds because
obviously<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.579> doesn't<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
obviously it doesn't really do much to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
obviously it doesn't really do much to
them<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> early<00:02:02.549> rounds

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
them but it's nice in the early rounds

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.069 
them but it's nice in the early rounds
it<00:02:02.880> kills<00:02:03.060> them<00:02:03.149> real<00:02:03.329> quick<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> let<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.930> get

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it kills them real quick and let you get

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.010 
it kills them real quick and let you get
power-ups<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> nice<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.299> little

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
power-ups it's a nice little little

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
power-ups it's a nice little little
trick<00:02:07.229> alright<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:07.920> uh<00:02:08.099> let's<00:02:08.310> get

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
trick alright so let's uh let's get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
trick alright so let's uh let's get

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.950 

you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.120> was<00:02:22.120> thinking<00:02:22.150> when<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.750> was

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
you know I was thinking when I was

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.800 
you know I was thinking when I was
playing<00:02:23.290> by<00:02:23.500> myself<00:02:23.680> without<00:02:24.070> recording<00:02:24.370> um

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
playing by myself without recording um

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.030 
playing by myself without recording um
like<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.900> was<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.170> was<00:02:26.260> thinking<00:02:26.560> maybe<00:02:26.680> um

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
like I was I was thinking maybe um

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.100 
like I was I was thinking maybe um
should<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> run<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> door<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.020> middle

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
should I run to the door in the middle

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.170 
should I run to the door in the middle
of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.350> round<00:02:29.620> or<00:02:29.980> should<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.730> or<00:02:30.940> should<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
of the round or should I or should I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180 
of the round or should I or should I
just<00:02:31.270> wait<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> end<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.080> round<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.650> I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
just wait to the end of the round and I

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.770 
just wait to the end of the round and I
I<00:02:33.220> chose<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.850> wait<00:02:34.270> till<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> end<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
I chose to wait till the end of the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.330 
I chose to wait till the end of the
round<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.170> i<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.830> i<00:02:35.920> should<00:02:36.100> do<00:02:36.190> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
round but I i think i should do that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.830 
round but I i think i should do that
more<00:02:36.400> often<00:02:36.730> because<00:02:36.940> i<00:02:37.210> think<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.540> it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
more often because i think it's it's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.270 
more often because i think it's it's
pretty<00:02:38.140> dangerous<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.680> i'm<00:02:38.830> going<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.220> around

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
pretty dangerous if i'm going for around

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.390 
pretty dangerous if i'm going for around
5000<00:02:43.140> ok<00:02:44.140> tunnel<00:02:44.470> 11<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.830> gonna<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.100> excavated

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
5000 ok tunnel 11 is gonna be excavated

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.010 
5000 ok tunnel 11 is gonna be excavated
i<00:02:45.700> was<00:02:45.790> listening<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.210> real<00:02:46.450> quick<00:02:46.630> now

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
i was listening to that real quick now

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.560 
i was listening to that real quick now
but<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.470> super<00:02:47.950> important<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:49.540> just

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
but it's just super important to to just

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.150 
but it's just super important to to just
like<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:50.140> careful<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.710> know<00:02:50.800> nothing<00:02:51.130> like

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
like be careful you know nothing like

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.950 
like be careful you know nothing like
not<00:02:51.460> even<00:02:51.610> risk<00:02:51.970> anything<00:02:52.240> if<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.630> go<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.840> for

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
not even risk anything if you go in for

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.040 
not even risk anything if you go in for
a<00:02:53.020> high<00:02:53.200> round<00:02:53.430> because<00:02:54.430> one<00:02:55.300> down<00:02:55.540> could<00:02:55.900> mean

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
a high round because one down could mean

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.750 
a high round because one down could mean
that<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> game<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.650> over<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.070> may<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.460> three

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that the game is over you may have three

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.580 
that the game is over you may have three
more<00:02:57.910> quick<00:02:58.150> revives<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:58.990> what<00:02:59.140> if<00:02:59.230> you're<00:02:59.440> on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
more quick revives but what if you're on

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.440 
more quick revives but what if you're on
your<00:02:59.710> way<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.890> quick<00:03:00.130> revive<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.270> go<00:03:01.420> down

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
your way to quick revive and you go down

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.930 
your way to quick revive and you go down
and<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.960> don't<00:03:02.830> get<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.100> time<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.430> know<00:03:03.460> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and you don't get it in time you know so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.850 
and you don't get it in time you know so
that<00:03:03.970> would<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.390> would<00:03:04.450> totally<00:03:04.750> suck<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.830> I
