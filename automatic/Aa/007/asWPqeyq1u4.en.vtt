00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and as you know we've taken we've opened

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
and as you know we've taken we've opened
up<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> Z<00:00:54.090> ones<00:00:54.329> before<00:00:54.750> we're<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> open

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
up the Z ones before we're going to open

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.889 
up the Z ones before we're going to open
it<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.039> we'll<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:58.460> into

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
it up and we'll do that right now into

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.410 
it up and we'll do that right now into
service<00:01:00.899> mode

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.770 

once<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:06.409> service<00:01:07.159> mode<00:01:07.570> those<00:01:08.570> two

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
once it's in service mode those two

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.410 
once it's in service mode those two
buttons<00:01:09.110> are<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.470> takes<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.890> open<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.220> up

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
buttons are all it takes to open it up

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.090 
buttons are all it takes to open it up
there<00:01:11.420> is<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.570> Kensington<00:01:11.900> lock<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.680> comes<00:01:12.920> in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
there is a Kensington lock that comes in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.620 
there is a Kensington lock that comes in
through<00:01:13.280> here<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:13.850> can't<00:01:14.210> lock<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
through here so you can't lock the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.810 
through here so you can't lock the
chassis<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.229> okay<00:01:15.770> but<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.460> simple

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
chassis down okay but it is that simple

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.790 
chassis down okay but it is that simple
to<00:01:16.880> change<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:17.930> when<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.260> not<00:01:18.440> running

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
to change and then when it's not running

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.170 
to change and then when it's not running
but<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.130> running<00:01:19.400> now<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.820> can't<00:01:20.060> take

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
but it's running now so I can't take

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.649 
but it's running now so I can't take
anything

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
anything

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.770 
anything
these<00:01:21.380> simple<00:01:21.800> green<00:01:22.130> touch<00:01:22.460> points<00:01:22.910> allow

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
these simple green touch points allow

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.600 
these simple green touch points allow
you<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.050> remove<00:01:24.380> things<00:01:24.619> without<00:01:25.160> any<00:01:25.340> tools

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
you to remove things without any tools

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.820 
you to remove things without any tools
the<00:01:26.090> fact<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.509> got<00:01:26.630> forward-facing<00:01:27.140> SRS

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
the fact that you got forward-facing SRS

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.370 
the fact that you got forward-facing SRS
speaker<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.550> got<00:01:28.700> sound<00:01:29.360> coming<00:01:30.020> at<00:01:30.170> you

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
speaker so you got sound coming at you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.980 
speaker so you got sound coming at you
you<00:01:30.650> know<00:01:30.979> I'm<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.340> not<00:01:31.850> being<00:01:32.090> reflected

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
you know I'm in a not being reflected

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.310 
you know I'm in a not being reflected
off<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.110> tabletop<00:01:33.740> okay<00:01:34.130> okay<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.900> then<00:01:36.170> we

off the tabletop okay okay and then we

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.779 
off the tabletop okay okay and then we
built<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.650> little<00:01:36.800> dongle<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:37.369> here<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.640> give

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
built this little dongle in here to give

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.130 
built this little dongle in here to give
us<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.910> wireless<00:01:38.330> keyboard<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.720> mouse<00:01:38.869> so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
