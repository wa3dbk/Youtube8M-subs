that were not intended to be reachable

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.340 
that were not intended to be reachable
and<00:03:48.799> stuff<00:03:49.609> like<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:51.019> was<00:03:51.109> kind<00:03:51.290> of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
and stuff like that and it was kind of

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.520 
and stuff like that and it was kind of
sad<00:03:51.590> too<00:03:51.829> because<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:53.480> map<00:03:53.720> was<00:03:53.959> actually

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
sad too because this map was actually

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.780 
sad too because this map was actually
playable<00:03:55.100> since<00:03:56.030> September<00:03:57.010> like<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.220> have<00:03:58.519> no

doubt<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.150> my<00:03:59.239> mind<00:03:59.450> if<00:03:59.810> they<00:03:59.959> actually

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
doubt in my mind if they actually

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.690 
doubt in my mind if they actually
patched<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.769> game<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.430> could<00:04:01.609> have

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
patched the game this could have

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.170 
patched the game this could have
happened<00:04:01.870> last<00:04:02.870> year<00:04:03.140> because<00:04:04.090> there's<00:04:05.090> a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
happened last year because there's a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.630 
happened last year because there's a
video<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.250> couple<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.519> the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
video it's just a couple of the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.190 
video it's just a couple of the
machinima<00:04:08.150> guys<00:04:08.359> I<00:04:08.390> think<00:04:08.750> are<00:04:08.870> coupled<00:04:09.140> the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
machinima guys I think are coupled the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.650 
machinima guys I think are coupled the
IGN<00:04:09.620> guys<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.859> forgot<00:04:10.400> which<00:04:10.579> group<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.540> they

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
IGN guys I forgot which group but they

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.180 
IGN guys I forgot which group but they
were<00:04:11.720> playing<00:04:11.989> slumlord<00:04:12.590> way<00:04:12.799> back<00:04:13.010> in

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
were playing slumlord way back in

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.160 
were playing slumlord way back in
September<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.000> kind<00:04:14.359> of<00:04:14.390> based<00:04:14.660> upon<00:04:15.019> the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
September and kind of based upon the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.800 
September and kind of based upon the
fact<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.829> they<00:04:16.430> did<00:04:16.609> no<00:04:16.880> real<00:04:17.209> work<00:04:17.450> from<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
fact that they did no real work from the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.759 
fact that they did no real work from the
map<00:04:17.989> from<00:04:18.349> tango<00:04:18.709> down<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.220> Richard

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
map from tango down to Richard

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.740 
map from tango down to Richard
Shin<00:04:20.009> they<00:04:20.879> really<00:04:21.269> could<00:04:21.449> have<00:04:21.479> released

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
Shin they really could have released

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.390 
Shin they really could have released
that<00:04:21.930> patch<00:04:22.109> any<00:04:22.379> time<00:04:22.590> they<00:04:22.740> wanted<00:04:23.009> to<00:04:23.190> with

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that patch any time they wanted to with

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.450 
that patch any time they wanted to with
the<00:04:23.520> new<00:04:23.669> map<00:04:23.879> and<00:04:24.240> um<00:04:25.190> that's<00:04:26.190> kind<00:04:26.430> of

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the new map and um that's kind of

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.860 
the new map and um that's kind of
evident<00:04:26.819> because<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> fact<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:27.599> when<00:04:27.840> I

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
evident because of the fact that when I

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.360 
evident because of the fact that when I
went<00:04:28.050> through<00:04:28.259> the<00:04:28.379> actual<00:04:28.740> video<00:04:29.009> I<00:04:29.069> think

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
went through the actual video I think

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.830 
went through the actual video I think
that<00:04:29.490> troll<00:04:29.729> video<00:04:30.060> i<00:04:30.330> posted<00:04:30.659> yesterday

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
that troll video i posted yesterday

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.170 
that troll video i posted yesterday
about<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.470> new<00:04:31.710> content<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:33.030> was

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
about the new content that was

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.020 
about the new content that was
supposedly<00:04:33.509> going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.960> happen<00:04:34.319> quote<00:04:34.560> unquote

I<00:04:36.030> actually<00:04:36.389> kind<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.020> went<00:04:37.259> back<00:04:37.379> into

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
I actually kind of went back into

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.790 
I actually kind of went back into
slumlord<00:04:38.129> to<00:04:38.250> see<00:04:38.490> what's<00:04:38.729> different<00:04:39.300> from

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
slumlord to see what's different from

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.999 
slumlord to see what's different from
this<00:04:40.800> version<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.490> retribution<00:04:42.949> compared<00:04:43.949> to

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
this version and retribution compared to

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.890 
this version and retribution compared to
the<00:04:44.280> tango<00:04:44.580> down<00:04:44.729> version<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.479> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
the tango down version and the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.890 
the tango down version and the
Lighting's<00:04:46.349> a<00:04:46.560> little<00:04:46.919> bit<00:04:47.039> different<00:04:47.900> from

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
Lighting's a little bit different from

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.020 
Lighting's a little bit different from
tango<00:04:49.289> down<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.650> retribution<00:04:49.889> version<00:04:50.520> it's

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
tango down and retribution version it's

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.700 
tango down and retribution version it's
a<00:04:51.090> lot<00:04:51.270> more<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.930> guess<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:52.319> can<00:04:52.440> say<00:04:52.530> it's<00:04:52.650> a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
a lot more I guess you can say it's a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.070 
a lot more I guess you can say it's a
lot<00:04:52.830> more<00:04:52.860> shinier<00:04:53.639> is<00:04:54.599> the<00:04:54.720> best<00:04:54.900> way<00:04:55.050> of

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
lot more shinier is the best way of

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.800 
lot more shinier is the best way of
putting<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.560> but<00:04:55.830> aside<00:04:56.759> from<00:04:56.819> that<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.419> went<00:04:57.720> to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
putting it but aside from that I went to

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.870 
putting it but aside from that I went to
the<00:04:58.020> same<00:04:58.229> exact<00:04:58.650> stereo<00:04:59.099> why<00:04:59.220> they<00:04:59.430> got<00:04:59.610> stuck

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the same exact stereo why they got stuck

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.749 
the same exact stereo why they got stuck
on<00:05:00.060> my<00:05:00.720> patch<00:05:00.960> minute<00:05:01.289> video<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.370> saw<00:05:02.550> that

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
on my patch minute video if you saw that

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.510 
on my patch minute video if you saw that
and<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.900> had<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.500> same<00:05:04.680> glitch<00:05:04.949> i<00:05:05.250> was

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
and it had the same glitch i was

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.920 
and it had the same glitch i was
literally<00:05:05.819> getting<00:05:06.060> stuck<00:05:06.509> in<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.720> same

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
literally getting stuck in the same

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.620 
literally getting stuck in the same
exact<00:05:07.289> area<00:05:07.680> over<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.220> over<00:05:08.310> again<00:05:08.580> so<00:05:09.479> there

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
exact area over and over again so there

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.110 
exact area over and over again so there
was<00:05:09.750> no<00:05:09.840> testing<00:05:10.349> done<00:05:10.560> there<00:05:10.830> was<00:05:10.949> it<00:05:11.580> really

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
was no testing done there was it really

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.629 
was no testing done there was it really
wasn't<00:05:12.690> copy<00:05:13.139> and<00:05:13.380> paste<00:05:13.440> job<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.460> mean

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
wasn't copy and paste job and I mean

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.270 
wasn't copy and paste job and I mean
that's<00:05:14.909> kind<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.240> disappointing<00:05:16.219> but<00:05:17.219> at

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
that's kind of disappointing but at

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.499 
that's kind of disappointing but at
least<00:05:17.490> they're<00:05:17.669> taking<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:18.000> patent<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.330> map

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
least they're taking the patent the map

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.869 
least they're taking the patent the map
down<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:19.169> spite<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.009> this<00:05:20.159> admitting<00:05:20.729> it

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
down in spite of all this admitting it

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.430 
down in spite of all this admitting it
was<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.030> mistake<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.419> patch<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.229> first

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
was a mistake to patch it in the first

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.640 
was a mistake to patch it in the first
place<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:23.009> kind<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.610> correcting<00:05:24.060> problem

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
place and kind of correcting problem

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.959 
place and kind of correcting problem
granted<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.740> map<00:05:25.919> is<00:05:26.069> still<00:05:26.250> garbage<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:26.909> it

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
granted the map is still garbage and it

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.089 
granted the map is still garbage and it
sucks<00:05:27.349> but<00:05:28.349> at<00:05:28.500> least<00:05:28.590> you're<00:05:28.830> trying<00:05:28.919> to

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
sucks but at least you're trying to

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.510 
sucks but at least you're trying to
correct<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.430> issue<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.289> Jared<00:05:31.520> Garretson

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
correct the issue and Jared Garretson

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.230 
correct the issue and Jared Garretson
and<00:05:32.880> Loki<00:05:33.719> also<00:05:34.469> kind<00:05:35.009> of<00:05:35.069> added<00:05:35.310> on<00:05:35.460> with<00:05:36.090> this

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
and Loki also kind of added on with this

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.659 
and Loki also kind of added on with this
temporary<00:05:36.779> closure<00:05:37.080> for<00:05:37.380> slum<00:05:37.620> Lord<00:05:37.919> that

temporary closure for slum Lord that

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.730 
temporary closure for slum Lord that
they'll<00:05:38.969> be<00:05:39.210> reintroducing<00:05:39.750> actually

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
they'll be reintroducing actually

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.999 
they'll be reintroducing actually

this<00:06:58.470> but<00:06:58.920> it's<00:06:59.220> not<00:06:59.430> enough<00:06:59.760> simple<00:07:00.540> is<00:07:00.630> that

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
this but it's not enough simple is that

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.800 
this but it's not enough simple is that
it's<00:07:01.260> not<00:07:02.030> anywhere<00:07:03.030> near<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.360> level<00:07:03.390> we

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
it's not anywhere near the level we

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.080 
it's not anywhere near the level we
expect<00:07:04.290> from<00:07:04.440> zombie<00:07:04.980> and<00:07:05.070> pw<00:07:05.520> we<00:07:05.790> know<00:07:05.910> they

expect from zombie and pw we know they

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.490 
expect from zombie and pw we know they
can<00:07:06.240> do<00:07:06.360> better<00:07:06.540> and<00:07:06.780> we<00:07:06.840> hope<00:07:07.080> they<00:07:07.260> can<00:07:07.440> do

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
can do better and we hope they can do
