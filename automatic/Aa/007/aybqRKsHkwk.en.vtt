00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
feel but it does offer some protection

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.819 
feel but it does offer some protection
in<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.239> way<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.870> protecting<00:03:52.590> it

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
in the way of you know protecting it

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.229 
in the way of you know protecting it
from<00:03:52.859> scratches<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.519> other<00:03:53.850> things<00:03:54.120> like
