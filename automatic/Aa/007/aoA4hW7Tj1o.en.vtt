00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 he is the candidate of wins perÃº ollanta 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 Humala opened the doors of her home 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.460
 to a newsteam team and it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.460
 He showed as a very loving father 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.420
 but narrowly and we also fall to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.730
 we and already an anger try to 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 enjoy your father to the fullest 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.090
 carnivalesque parenthesis between travel and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.430
 proselytist trip 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.710
 and is that as with all candidates 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.059
 It is not easy to get away from home and less if 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.309
 you have small children 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.590
 the girls and saving if I could talk 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.620
 they would issue status and program 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.559
 the elections on another date if always 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.690
 on vacation the campaigns should be 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.450
 at school time because there we do not 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.570
 we are all children that are in the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.590
 school that in his case the youngest of the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.030
 family is the cocky 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.800
 a month is a quiet boy by the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.570
 night and you're sleeping well 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.180
 lines know that traveling is not of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.850
 pleasure but for work that's why almost no 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
 can accompany him and although his energies 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.930
 they are consuming lalin 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.450
 heredia does it whenever he can 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.910
 we believe that this is a campaign in the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.040
 which the population has to see the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.830
 family and we are a family 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.780
 constituted and not only his wife contributes 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.970
 although the big policies are in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.619
 hands of the nationalist cadres 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:37.030
 Humala does not ignore the small 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:39.180
 suggestions giving you an idea more I'll give 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.180
 side 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.220
 in five years since the last campaign 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.740
 many things have happened in the family 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 humala some also in the interior 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 of the candidate himself 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.280
 I've been maturing and I've changed by 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 example in the first the first campaign 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.890
 I proposed the death penalty for 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 younger rapists 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.040
 now I think that does not correspond because 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.950
 in the end I have Christian convictions 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 Catholics today part of the pillars of their 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.810
 proposal is early childhood the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.980
 cribs and preschool education from 0 to 4 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810
 years 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.850
 Humala is sweating the fat drop for 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.830
 publicize his government plan goes 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.540
 fourth and he has a little less than seven 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.480
 weeks to get that voter 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.480
 elusive who shunned him five years ago
