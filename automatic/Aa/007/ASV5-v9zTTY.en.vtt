submachine<00:01:24.420> gun<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.259> come<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
submachine gun by the way come into the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.780 
submachine gun by the way come into the
questions<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> guys<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.610> been<00:01:26.640> asking

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
questions that you guys have been asking

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
questions that you guys have been asking
the<00:01:27.090> previous<00:01:27.360> diamond<00:01:27.659> mp7<00:01:28.439> gameplay<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> I

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the previous diamond mp7 gameplay that I

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
the previous diamond mp7 gameplay that I
posted<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.060> channel<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.740> yeah<00:01:31.740> first<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
posted on my channel and yeah first of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.289 
posted on my channel and yeah first of
all<00:01:32.189> let's<00:01:32.549> talk<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> recall

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
all let's talk a bit about the recall

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.260 
all let's talk a bit about the recall
from<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> vector<00:01:34.710> itself<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.549> there's<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
from the vector itself and there's a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.160 
from the vector itself and there's a
question<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.799> increases<00:01:38.810> does<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
question about if it increases does you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
question about if it increases does you
know<00:01:40.259> does<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> recoil<00:01:40.979> increase<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.579> add

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
know does the recoil increase if i add

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.719 
know does the recoil increase if i add
on<00:01:42.420> science<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.560> suppressor<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
on science or suppressor to the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.289 
on science or suppressor to the
submachine<00:01:45.479> gun<00:01:45.720> itself<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.770> example<00:01:46.829> um

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
submachine gun itself now for example um

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
submachine gun itself now for example um
you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.420> overall<00:01:49.130> look<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.189> fact<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.549> depends

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you know overall look in fact it depends

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.969 
you know overall look in fact it depends
on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> submachine<00:01:52.110> gun<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.530> using

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
on the submachine gun that you using

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
on the submachine gun that you using
right<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.189> depends<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> Condor<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
right it depends on the Condor use of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.620 
right it depends on the Condor use of
example<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.869> msmc<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> feel<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.630> there's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
example like msmc I feel that there's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030 
example like msmc I feel that there's
more<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.930> call<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.380> add<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> suppressor

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
more we call when I add the suppressor

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580 
more we call when I add the suppressor
on<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.490> without<00:01:59.820> no<00:02:00.450> feathers<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.320> i<00:02:01.409> don't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
on then without no feathers if i don't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
on then without no feathers if i don't
use<00:02:01.710> any<00:02:01.740> attachments<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.490> them<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> empty<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
use any attachments on them is empty I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.370 
use any attachments on them is empty I
don't<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.290> any<00:02:04.439> recoil<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:07.229> know

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
don't get any recoil at all and you know

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.949 
don't get any recoil at all and you know
oh<00:02:07.680> let's<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.610> say<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.119> vector<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
oh let's just say for the vector it's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
oh let's just say for the vector it's
pretty<00:02:10.349> much<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> same<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.160> i<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> silencer

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pretty much the same if i use a silencer

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.670 
pretty much the same if i use a silencer
with<00:02:12.239> outside

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
with outside

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.580 
with outside
still<00:02:13.099> has<00:02:13.189> the<00:02:13.340> same<00:02:13.519> recoil<00:02:14.319> level<00:02:15.319> yunus

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
still has the same recoil level yunus

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.800 
still has the same recoil level yunus
emre<00:02:15.739> level<00:02:16.159> of<00:02:16.219> recover<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.969> also<00:02:17.329> for<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.530> i

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
emre level of recover and also for the i

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.410 
emre level of recover and also for the i
guess<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.349> for<00:02:21.469> mp7<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.849> i<00:02:22.879> would<00:02:23.209> add

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
guess you know for mp7 if I i would add

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.059 
guess you know for mp7 if I i would add
you<00:02:23.659> know<00:02:23.750> once<00:02:23.989> again<00:02:24.200> suppressed<00:02:24.590> sila<00:02:24.920> I'll

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you know once again suppressed sila I'll

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.670 
you know once again suppressed sila I'll
get<00:02:25.250> more<00:02:25.430> recall<00:02:25.879> with<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.299> suppressor<00:02:27.200> than

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
get more recall with the suppressor than

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.890 
get more recall with the suppressor than
without<00:02:27.969> so<00:02:28.969> it's<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.659> of<00:02:29.780> those<00:02:29.840> things

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
without so it's one of those things

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.309 
without so it's one of those things
where<00:02:30.349> depends<00:02:31.099> on<00:02:31.189> the<00:02:31.280> gun<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.579> so<00:02:31.760> then<00:02:32.719> the

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
where depends on the gun is so then the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.589 
where depends on the gun is so then the
way<00:02:33.469> I<00:02:33.500> feel<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:33.859> now<00:02:34.239> when<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.299> had<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
way I feel right now when I had to

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.300 
way I feel right now when I had to
suppress<00:02:35.930> onto<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.260> vector<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.950> don't<00:02:37.159> get

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
suppress onto the vector I don't get

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.030 
suppress onto the vector I don't get
much<00:02:37.459> we<00:02:37.639> go<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.120> I'm<00:02:38.719> you<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.709> it's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
much we go so I'm you know so it's it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.949 
much we go so I'm you know so it's it's
fine<00:02:40.310> for<00:02:40.730> me<00:02:40.879> when<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> use<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.329> victim<00:02:41.840> no

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
fine for me when I use the victim no

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.750 
fine for me when I use the victim no
aiming<00:02:42.409> down<00:02:42.500> sights<00:02:42.560> similar<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.519> me<00:02:43.639> with

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
aiming down sights similar to me with

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.339 
aiming down sights similar to me with
and<00:02:43.879> without<00:02:44.000> using<00:02:44.359> suppressor<00:02:45.019> then<00:02:45.169> would

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
and without using suppressor then would

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.229 
and without using suppressor then would
he<00:02:45.439> notice<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.799> all<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:45.980> same<00:02:46.099> thing<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
he notice it's all the same thing so I

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.819 
he notice it's all the same thing so I
feel<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.689> feel<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.079> know<00:02:48.139> using<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
feel I feel you know using the

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.979 
feel I feel you know using the
suppressor<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.939> depends<00:02:50.389> nose<00:02:50.569> up<00:02:50.689> is<00:02:50.870> your

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
suppressor it depends nose up is your

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.420 
suppressor it depends nose up is your
choice<00:02:51.260> i<00:02:51.590> always<00:02:52.010> want<00:02:52.159> to<00:02:52.250> stick<00:02:52.400> my

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
choice i always want to stick my

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.009 
choice i always want to stick my
suppressor<00:02:52.909> on<00:02:53.120> anyway<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> don't<00:02:53.750> want<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> be

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
suppressor on anyway I don't want to be

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.530 
suppressor on anyway I don't want to be
detected<00:02:54.439> on<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.950> radar<00:02:55.129> even<00:02:55.879> though<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.299> use

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
detected on the radar even though I use

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.300 
detected on the radar even though I use
ghost<00:02:57.049> I'm<00:02:57.379> running<00:02:57.620> around<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.010> stuff<00:02:58.129> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
ghost I'm running around and stuff and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.830 
ghost I'm running around and stuff and
whatnot<00:02:58.459> there<00:02:59.000> will<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.120> points<00:02:59.480> ready<00:02:59.629> to

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
whatnot there will be points ready to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.080 
whatnot there will be points ready to
stand<00:03:00.049> still<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.889> here<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.549> capping

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
stand still like it here and capping

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.920 
stand still like it here and capping
flags<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.480> whatnot<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.120> important<00:03:05.689> to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
flags and whatnot so it is important to

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
using a super sat down with that I don't

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.259 
using a super sat down with that I don't
know<00:03:15.799> why<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:17.000> one<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> those

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
know why it just it's one of those

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.159 
know why it just it's one of those
habits<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:20.299> know<00:03:20.419> what<00:03:20.569> another

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
habits but you know what another

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.319 
habits but you know what another
question<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.560> arises<00:03:22.060> wants<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> let<00:03:23.239> me

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
question that arises wants to let me

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.939 
question that arises wants to let me
just<00:03:23.720> check<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.049> question<00:03:24.440> issue<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.889> that

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
just check this question issue is that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.490 
just check this question issue is that
you<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.459> why<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:25.940> once

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
you know why just once

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.740 
you know why just once
so<00:03:28.500> yeah<00:03:28.770> okay<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.120> vector<00:03:30.420> good

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
so yeah okay so this is a is vector good

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.720 
so yeah okay so this is a is vector good
guns<00:03:30.990> is<00:03:31.470> back<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.800> good<00:03:32.010> gun<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.370> obviously

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
guns is back to a good gun so obviously

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.510 
guns is back to a good gun so obviously
that's<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.930> those<00:03:34.020> questions<00:03:34.080> where<00:03:34.590> as<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
that's one of those questions where as a

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.000 
that's one of those questions where as a
confident<00:03:35.970> preference<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.780> overall<00:03:37.290> vector

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
confident preference and overall vector

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.650 
confident preference and overall vector
when<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.250> went<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.520> down<00:03:38.700> sight<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.270> does<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
when it went in down sight it does the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.390 
when it went in down sight it does the
job<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> quickest<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.100> machine

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
job for you it's the quickest on machine

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.100 
job for you it's the quickest on machine
gun<00:03:41.550> when<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.820> aim<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.030> sight<00:03:42.450> when<00:03:42.780> you're

scatter<00:04:12.690> when<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.050> shoot<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.010> don't<00:04:14.280> get

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
scatter when you shoot so you don't get

it at the target you don't get it in the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
center of the crosses what's up the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.810 
center of the crosses what's up the
courses<00:04:18.690> are<00:04:18.750> much<00:04:18.989> smaller<00:04:19.260> for<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.790> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
courses are much smaller for the for the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.290 
courses are much smaller for the for the
vector<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.890> really<00:04:23.130> good<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.310> use

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
vector so it is it is really good to use

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
vector so it is it is really good to use
minimal<00:04:24.690> bullets<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.200> get<00:04:25.590> an<00:04:25.800> easy<00:04:25.980> kill<00:04:26.310> with

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
really powerful long-range as well you

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.500 
really powerful long-range as well you
know<00:04:29.100> some<00:04:29.370> some<00:04:29.730> other<00:04:29.910> submission<00:04:30.330> guns

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
know some some other submission guns

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.190 
know some some other submission guns
require<00:04:31.580> certain<00:04:32.720> damage<00:04:33.720> certain<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.140> know

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
require certain damage certain you know

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.680 
require certain damage certain you know
you<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.860> damage<00:04:35.280> decreases<00:04:35.760> over<00:04:35.880> certain

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
you the damage decreases over certain

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.260 
you the damage decreases over certain
range<00:04:36.990> oh<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.250> msmc<00:04:38.880> if<00:04:39.000> you're<00:04:39.120> shooting

range oh so like msmc if you're shooting

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.570 
range oh so like msmc if you're shooting
from<00:04:39.510> afar<00:04:40.110> you're<00:04:40.650> gonna<00:04:40.740> get<00:04:40.890> shit<00:04:41.370> load<00:04:41.550> of

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
from afar you're gonna get shit load of

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.000 
from afar you're gonna get shit load of
recoil<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.990> damage<00:04:43.260> is<00:04:43.380> really<00:04:43.860> really

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
recoil and the damage is really really

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.159 
recoil and the damage is really really
low<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.790> using<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.270> vector<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.900> you're

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
low if using a vector and you're

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.630 
low if using a vector and you're
shooting<00:04:46.440> from<00:04:46.530> far<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.950> really<00:04:47.220> easy<00:04:47.370> to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
shooting from far it's really easy to

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.840 
shooting from far it's really easy to
take<00:04:48.030> out<00:04:48.180> an<00:04:48.330> opponent<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:49.370> long-range<00:04:50.370> so

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
take out an opponent a long-range so

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.510 
take out an opponent a long-range so
you're<00:04:51.630> able<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.290> uh<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:52.950> easily<00:04:53.340> get

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
you're able to uh you know easily get

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.010 
you're able to uh you know easily get
this<00:04:53.669> bullets<00:04:54.000> out<00:04:54.120> there<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.630> make<00:04:54.750> sure<00:04:54.780> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
this bullets out there and make sure you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.630 
this bullets out there and make sure you
don't<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.680> don't<00:04:55.800> miss<00:04:56.010> any<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.310> bullets

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
don't you don't miss any of the bullets

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.330 
don't you don't miss any of the bullets
because<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:58.830> all<00:04:58.890> it's<00:04:59.040> hard<00:04:59.250> to

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
because it's so it's all it's hard to

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.070 
because it's so it's all it's hard to
explain<00:04:59.520> because<00:04:59.669> this<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.600> easy<00:05:00.630> to

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
explain because this is so so easy to

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080 
explain because this is so so easy to
get<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.500> kills<00:05:02.370> cuz<00:05:02.580> all<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.760> bullets

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
get the kills cuz all the bullets

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.510 
get the kills cuz all the bullets
narrowed<00:05:03.600> down<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.230> go<00:05:04.440> straight<00:05:04.800> down<00:05:04.919> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
narrowed down and go straight down the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.070 
narrowed down and go straight down the
cross<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.000> doesn't<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.840> know<00:05:06.870> it's<00:05:07.020> not

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
cross it doesn't you know it's not

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.450 
cross it doesn't you know it's not
scattered<00:05:07.410> as<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.590> said<00:05:07.860> I'm<00:05:08.070> repeating<00:05:08.340> myself

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
scattered as I said I'm repeating myself

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.180 
scattered as I said I'm repeating myself
there<00:05:08.940> but<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.500> pretty<00:05:10.650> much<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.860> with<00:05:11.160> a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
there but that is pretty much it with a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.440 
there but that is pretty much it with a
vector<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.729> this<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.120> this<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
vector and this you know this is the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.850 
vector and this you know this is the
diamond<00:05:12.840> camera<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.200> can<00:05:13.229> see<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.560> diamond

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
diamond camera you can see the diamond

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.650 
diamond camera you can see the diamond
on<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:13.979> side<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.210> got<00:05:15.360> going<00:05:15.630> on

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
on the side of it and it's got going on

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.710 
on the side of it and it's got going on
the<00:05:15.780> top<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.380> not<00:05:17.070> every<00:05:17.370> gun<00:05:18.150> when<00:05:18.450> it<00:05:18.540> comes

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
the top so not every gun when it comes

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.930 
the top so not every gun when it comes
to<00:05:18.780> diamond<00:05:19.169> has<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:19.979> cause<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.310> diamond

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
to diamond has it all cause of diamond

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.140 
to diamond has it all cause of diamond
so<00:05:21.570> um<00:05:21.780> is<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.680> half<00:05:22.979> off<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:24.060> know

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
so um is that half off so you know

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.310 
so um is that half off so you know
showing<00:05:24.390> a<00:05:24.479> bit<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.720> gold<00:05:24.900> enveloped

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
showing a bit of the gold enveloped

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.659 
showing a bit of the gold enveloped
diamond<00:05:25.740> should<00:05:25.919> have<00:05:26.040> bling<00:05:26.220> bling<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.550> know

any problem is obviously is the is the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.460 
any problem is obviously is the is the
amination<00:05:56.420> that<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.780> available<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.410> you

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
amination that is available so you

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.610 
amination that is available so you
pretty<00:05:57.830> much<00:05:57.950> have<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.430> be<00:05:58.640> forced<00:05:59.420> to<00:05:59.720> use<00:05:59.960> an

know next to the clip because I'd rather

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.460 
know next to the clip because I'd rather
