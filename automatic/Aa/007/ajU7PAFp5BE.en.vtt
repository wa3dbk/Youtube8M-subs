00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
room ok also i think they should add
more<00:02:00.479> shops<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:01.740> malls<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
more shops and more malls and so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.980 
mean I think that would be really cool
like<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.670> more<00:02:50.820> variety<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
really think if they're gonna make a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.450 
really think if they're gonna make a
mall<00:02:53.810> make<00:02:54.810> almost<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> stores<00:02:55.800> interval

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
mall make almost all the stores interval

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.310 
mall make almost all the stores interval
like<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.760> don't<00:02:56.880> want<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.240> see<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.660> picture<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.170> a

like we don't want to see a picture of a
store<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:58.860> not<00:02:59.010> being<00:02:59.190> able<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.490> go<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
store and then not being able to go in

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.100 
store and then not being able to go in
it<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> spit<00:03:01.080> in

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it like that's just kind of a spit in

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.840 
it like that's just kind of a spit in
the<00:03:01.230> face<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.710> know<00:03:01.800> what<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.950> mean<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.820> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430 
the face you know what I mean so I
really<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.540> should<00:03:03.690> add<00:03:03.870> more<00:03:04.110> malls

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
really think this should add more malls

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.530 
really think this should add more malls
and<00:03:04.710> stuff<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.190> know<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.520> if<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:06.270> do<00:03:06.330> add

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and stuff you know and if they do add

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.760 
and stuff you know and if they do add
models<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.110> said<00:03:07.320> add<00:03:07.500> more<00:03:08.040> stores<00:03:09.770> so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
models like I said add more stores so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.170 
models like I said add more stores so
yeah<00:03:10.920> basically<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.400> sum<00:03:11.430> up<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:11.850> I've<00:03:11.970> said

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
yeah basically to sum up what I've said

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.320 
yeah basically to sum up what I've said
is<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:13.170> should<00:03:13.320> add<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.800> things<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.550> to
