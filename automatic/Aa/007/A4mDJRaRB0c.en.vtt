angle<00:00:12.870> brush<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.590> brush<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.160> apply<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
angle brush and a brush to apply the

glue you definitely want to use a brush
that<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:17.520> care<00:00:17.789> too<00:00:17.970> much

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
that you really don't care too much

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.470 
that you really don't care too much
about<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.840> will<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.230> clumpy<00:00:20.480> first

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
about because it will get clumpy first

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060 
about because it will get clumpy first
thing<00:00:21.630> I'm<00:00:21.779> doing<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> taking<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.529> brush<00:00:22.859> in

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
thing I'm doing is taking that brush in

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
thing I'm doing is taking that brush in
I<00:00:23.220> am<00:00:23.369> applying<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.910> thin<00:00:24.240> layer<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
I am applying a thin layer to the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
I am applying a thin layer to the
beginning<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.439> brow<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
beginning of my brow and you want to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
beginning of my brow and you want to
work<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.000> sections<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> glue<00:00:28.170> will

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
work in sections because the glue will

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
work in sections because the glue will
dry<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.920> quickly<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
dry very quickly and then I'm going to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
dry very quickly and then I'm going to
top<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.439> color<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.189> ombre

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
top it with the first color of my ombre

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.010 
top it with the first color of my ombre
which<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.780> pretty

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
which is this really really pretty

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.190 
which is this really really pretty
blueish<00:00:34.890> teal<00:00:35.219> color<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.690> find<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.050> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
blueish teal color and I find that it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.130 
blueish teal color and I find that it's
easier<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> pack<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.760> glitter<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> here

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
easier to pack on the glitter so here

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930
