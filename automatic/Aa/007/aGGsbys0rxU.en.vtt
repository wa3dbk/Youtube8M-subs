I'm going to show you an operate that
I've<00:00:19.199> made<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.980> system<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> in

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I've made to the system that I have in

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.580 
I've made to the system that I have in
my<00:00:21.270> house<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:22.020> really<00:00:22.140> sorry<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
my house I'm really sorry for the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.990 
my house I'm really sorry for the
flickering<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> light<00:00:23.490> conditions

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
flickering that's the light conditions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.490 
flickering that's the light conditions
and<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> camera<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.960> having<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.350> hard

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and the camera is having a really hard

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.460 
and the camera is having a really hard
time<00:00:25.619> picking<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.080> router<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.349> some

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
time picking up the router for some

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.580 
time picking up the router for some
reason<00:00:28.769> anyway<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:30.449> first<00:00:31.199> thing<00:00:31.320> I'd<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
reason anyway so first thing I'd like to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.819 
reason anyway so first thing I'd like to
point<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.149> router<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
point out is that the router is

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
point out is that the router is
converting<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.190> ADSL<00:00:36.180> connection<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
converting the ADSL connection into a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
converting the ADSL connection into a
DSL<00:00:37.230> connection<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.340> makes<00:00:38.520> sense<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
DSL connection and that makes sense in a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.799 
DSL connection and that makes sense in a
minute<00:00:38.940> even<00:00:39.270> though<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> sounds<00:00:39.570> ludicrous

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
minute even though it sounds ludicrous

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
minute even though it sounds ludicrous
but<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.640> bear<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.790> me<00:00:41.940> because

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
but that's just bear with me because

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
but that's just bear with me because
that's<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:42.989> doing<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.430> I'd

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that's kind of what it's doing and I'd

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's kind of what it's doing and I'd
like<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.120> show<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:45.989> isn't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
like to to show you that there isn't

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920 
like to to show you that there isn't
even<00:00:46.410> its<00:00:46.559> jack<00:00:47.100> plugged<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.719> an

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
even its jack plugged in to it and an

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.310 
even its jack plugged in to it and an
ADSL<00:00:49.260> connection<00:00:49.620> okay<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.250> done<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
ADSL connection okay so that's done and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
ADSL connection okay so that's done and
we<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> main<00:00:53.219> beast<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
trouble connecting as you can see that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
trouble connecting as you can see that's
that's<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.760> connection<00:01:07.159> information<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's the connection information but I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
that's the connection information but I
haven't<00:01:10.020> been<00:01:10.110> able<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> come<00:01:10.500> onto<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.890> even

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
haven't been able to come onto it even

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.300 
haven't been able to come onto it even
though<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:13.250> what's<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
though I have the what's what is this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.179

that<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.180> rj45<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.560> roll<00:01:23.189> over<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that thing the rj45 some roll over I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.600 
that thing the rj45 some roll over I
think<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> rollover<00:01:24.540> cable<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.610> no

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think it's a rollover cable is it no

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
think it's a rollover cable is it no
sorry<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.270> no<00:01:27.840> service<00:01:28.350> crossover

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
sorry I think it's no service crossover

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
sorry I think it's no service crossover
yeah<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.090> crossover<00:01:30.509> cable<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
yeah so the crossover cable to do that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.999 
yeah so the crossover cable to do that
connection<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.310> states<00:01:33.000> inside<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
connection thing which states inside the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
connection thing which states inside the
instruction<00:01:35.009> manual<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
instruction manual that you need to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.200 
instruction manual that you need to
connect<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.590> becomes<00:01:38.210> now

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
connect to it on one becomes now

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
connect to it on one becomes now
unfortunately<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.900> hyper<00:01:40.079> terminal<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
unfortunately with hyper terminal I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
unfortunately with hyper terminal I
haven't<00:01:40.860> managed<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> connect<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
haven't managed to get it to connect so

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.850 
haven't managed to get it to connect so
what<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:42.869> thinking<00:01:42.899> about<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.470> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what I'm thinking about doing is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.230 
what I'm thinking about doing is
connecting<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.579> thing<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.119> Sisko<00:01:47.240> rj45

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
connecting that thing to Sisko rj45

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.990 
connecting that thing to Sisko rj45
rollover<00:01:48.899> cables<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.909> converting<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
rollover cables and then converting the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.880 
rollover cables and then converting the
connection<00:01:51.390> using<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:53.090> which<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
connection using this thing which is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.660 
connection using this thing which is
apparently<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.149> main<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.490> I'm<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
apparently the main bit so I'm going to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.620 
apparently the main bit so I'm going to
use<00:01:59.790> one<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> those<00:02:03.780> two

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
use one of these one of those two

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.030 
use one of these one of those two
well<00:02:06.229> yeah<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.650> have<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.979> those

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
well yeah I'm going to have one of those

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.460 
well yeah I'm going to have one of those
on<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> back<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.759> on<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.119> Sisqo<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.840> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
on the back of it on the Sisqo one and a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.800 
on the back of it on the Sisqo one and a
coupler<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.920> middle<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.640> think<00:02:11.030> that

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
coupler in the middle and I think that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.699 
coupler in the middle and I think that
should<00:02:12.050> connect<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.440> it

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
should connect to it

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.000 
should connect to it
if<00:02:13.190> anybody's<00:02:13.640> tried<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.050> leave<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> comment

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
if anybody's tried that leave a comment

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.490 
if anybody's tried that leave a comment
below<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:19.450> well<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.660> tell<00:02:21.140> me<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.410> works

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
below and well just tell me if it works

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.880 
below and well just tell me if it works
or<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:21.709> really<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> that's<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:24.709> want

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
or not really so that's that I just want

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.460 
or not really so that's that I just want
to<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.190> also<00:02:25.630> well<00:02:26.630> not<00:02:26.810> fouling<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.200> mean<00:02:27.319> I'm

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
to and also well not fouling I mean I'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.010 
to and also well not fouling I mean I'm
going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.010> show<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.400> now<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
going to show this now so this is the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.130 
going to show this now so this is the
broadband<00:02:30.850> broadband<00:02:31.850> connection<00:02:32.420> really

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
broadband broadband connection really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690 
broadband broadband connection really
this<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.220> where<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.610> magic

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
this is this is where all the magic

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.750 
this is this is where all the magic
happens<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.300> from<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:35.989> port<00:02:36.230> 23<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
happens so from this port 23 the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
happens so from this port 23 the
connection<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.480> being<00:02:38.600> shared<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> all<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
connection is being shared to all the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.160 
connection is being shared to all the
other<00:02:39.709> ports<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.280> 17<00:02:40.760> got<00:02:41.239> 20<00:02:41.810> down<00:02:41.959> there<00:02:42.140> I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
other ports so 17 got 20 down there I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.870 
other ports so 17 got 20 down there I
think<00:02:42.620> no<00:02:43.069> 22<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.600> 7<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.319> 3<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.819> is

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
think no 22 this is 7 and 3 so this is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.320 
think no 22 this is 7 and 3 so this is
the<00:02:48.100> other<00:02:49.100> answer<00:02:49.519> that's<00:02:49.819> where<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.120> is

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the other answer that's where this is

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.590 
the other answer that's where this is
connected<00:02:50.930> into<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.470> box<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.600> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
connected into this box and the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.570 
connected into this box and the
connection<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.170> going<00:02:54.410> from<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:57.370> rj45<00:02:58.370> lead

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
connection is going from this rj45 lead

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.410 
connection is going from this rj45 lead
here<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.299> audio<00:02:59.750> 45<00:03:00.110> lead<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:01.180> but<00:03:02.180> in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
here to this audio 45 lead here but in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.830 
here to this audio 45 lead here but in
my<00:03:02.900> previous<00:03:03.170> video<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.950> might<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:04.310> seen

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
my previous video you might have seen

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.410 
my previous video you might have seen
this<00:03:05.840> space<00:03:06.350> here<00:03:06.739> being<00:03:07.310> occupied<00:03:07.610> by<00:03:07.790> two

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
this space here being occupied by two

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.410 
this space here being occupied by two
leads<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.140> now<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> monthly<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:11.239> one's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
leads and now the monthly that one's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.860 
leads and now the monthly that one's
empty

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
empty

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.130 
empty
I'm<00:03:12.079> false<00:03:12.440> alarm<00:03:12.769> still<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.400> means<00:03:13.850> that

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
I'm false alarm still so that means that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.270 
I'm false alarm still so that means that
this<00:03:15.140> computer<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.650> still<00:03:15.769> receiving<00:03:16.130> an

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
this computer is still receiving an

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.460 
this computer is still receiving an
internet<00:03:16.579> connection<00:03:17.110> whilst<00:03:18.110> being<00:03:18.260> plugged

internet connection whilst being plugged

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.920 
internet connection whilst being plugged
into<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.769> switch<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:20.209> saved<00:03:20.630> up<00:03:20.750> that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
into the switch and that saved up that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.520 
into the switch and that saved up that
slot<00:03:21.530> there<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.130> router<00:03:22.310> now<00:03:22.549> lives<00:03:23.530> as

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
slot there of the router now lives as

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.380 
slot there of the router now lives as
you<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.040> see<00:03:25.250> same<00:03:26.769> wire<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:28.250> rj45<00:03:28.940> going<00:03:29.150> into

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
you can see same wire of rj45 going into

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.229 
you can see same wire of rj45 going into
it<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.720> that's<00:03:30.350> being<00:03:31.190> connected<00:03:31.430> up<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.850> TV

fiber ports well I've been told the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.360 
fiber ports well I've been told the
fiber<00:03:50.750> ports<00:03:51.079> but<00:03:51.260> we're<00:03:51.769> not<00:03:51.950> they<00:03:52.070> are<00:03:52.190> is

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
fiber ports but we're not they are is

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.199 
fiber ports but we're not they are is
debatable<00:03:52.850> but<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.030> state<00:03:56.150> of

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
debatable but that's the state of

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.780 
debatable but that's the state of
affairs<00:03:56.299> now<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.870> yeah<00:03:57.530> that's<00:03:58.310> pretty<00:03:58.459> much
