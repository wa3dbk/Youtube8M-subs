00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
into the into the glass or how we're

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.599 
into the into the glass or how we're
mixing<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> bus<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
be able to dissolve it then I'm going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.110 
be able to dissolve it then I'm going to
use<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> spoon<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.320> need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> solve<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.120> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
use a spoon and we need to solve it in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
use a spoon and we need to solve it in
the<00:00:51.180> poorer<00:00:56.329> now<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> next<00:00:57.809> step<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.800> put

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the poorer now the next step is to put

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.440 
the poorer now the next step is to put
your<00:00:59.219> ice<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> cup

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.660 

then<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.400> homogenized<00:01:11.400> milk

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then we're going to use homogenized milk

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
then we're going to use homogenized milk
and<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.780> depends<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.440> prefer

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and if it depends on you if you prefer

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
and if it depends on you if you prefer
using<00:01:13.950> skim<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.460> saw<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:14.880> whatever<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.420> doesn't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
using skim or saw or whatever it doesn't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.670 
using skim or saw or whatever it doesn't
matter<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.050> we're<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> use<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> whole

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
matter but we're going to use the whole

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.640 
matter but we're going to use the whole
milk<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.910> of<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.750> 3/4<00:01:22.440> because

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
milk and we just kind of go 3/4 because

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
milk and we just kind of go 3/4 because
we're<00:01:22.800> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> add<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.400> chain<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.820> it
