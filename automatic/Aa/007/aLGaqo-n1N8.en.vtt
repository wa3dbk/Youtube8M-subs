00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.430
 I had a bad habit of substituting you ... 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.430
 Every obstacle you faced. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.009
 I thought you would not be able to beat them. 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.889
 But you overcame. 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.430
 I did not expect to see you so ... you! 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.600
 My time as a human is over. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
 But I've never felt so alive! 0: 00: 32.009,0: 00: 22.889 I thought we'd be safe forever ... 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.430
 But the forever did not last as long as I expected. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.600
 I have to report a crime ... 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.009
 The Cullens, they did something ... terrible! 

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.889
 The Vulturi think Renesmee is an immortal child. 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:49.430
 She was born like this, not bitten, she grows every day. 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 Oh my! 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.009
 Raising an immortal child has long been forbidden. 

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.889
 And it is punished in the most severe way ... 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.430
 Death. 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 What was Alice? 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.009
 The Vulturi ... they come after us! 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.889
 If we have enough witnesses, maybe the Vulturi will hear us. 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.430
 We started looking for vampires in the most remote corners of the world. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.600
 My family is in danger, I need your help. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.009
 Each one with his own gift. 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.889
 You ... you're an incredible woman. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.600
 We went with you. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.009
 The pack will fight. 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.889
 I've never been afraid of vampires. 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.430
 EVERY MOMENT 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.600
 CONDUCTED IT 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.009
 I'll never let anyone hurt you. 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.889
 THE EPIC END 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.600
 THAT YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER
