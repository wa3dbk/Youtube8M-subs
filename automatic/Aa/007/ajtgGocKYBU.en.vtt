00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.000
 Tell us you guys are starting. 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 the fifth edition of our video tutorial 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 about making a game of old on the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.609
 android 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 In the last class we implemented our 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 Play button where it goes through all the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.649
 buttons cleaning the text of the buttons case 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.570
 it contains something also when we 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.030
 we enter the game the buttons they come 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 and only after pressing the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 play is that it is possible to play 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 that is, we only had one button after 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 complete the play and for that we 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 we did define a method in the game 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 we define method 7 and neither will 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 square here in method 7 remembered 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 square I want to make some 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.270
 comments on this looping here folks 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.359
 scroll all the buttons on the screen as 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.400
 we have already seen this square ghetti function 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 is the function we have implemented to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.930
 first class that she uses the function 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 find the view itag she picks up through 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.619
 our constant that we defined here 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.479
 square we defined the first class 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 that has stream framed in letter 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.250
 lowercase he retrieves the button for us 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.049
 through the method was in the view itag 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 where do we go with a parameter to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.130
 our constant square and one more 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 integer that represents the button that we 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.479
 We're trying to get this doctor back. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.540
 will prevent us when you use the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.939
 People want to get a job through the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 her late and not through the name is a 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.259
 way that android allows us to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 work with our xml file 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.040
 similar to how we work with a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 html document using java script 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.270
 we look for the element through a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 tag defined there in the xml file 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 then this method square meter the people 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 use it several times within the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.570
 our application when we want to 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.790
 example clear all fields or when 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.719
 We want to enable or disable all 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.250
 the fields 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.960
 therefore complements this method already in the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.060
 first class because it will be 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 constantly used 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 when we need to work on 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 of all buttons if by chance you do not 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.630
 you are 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.490
 still understanding very well in the coming 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.770
 classes we will define method by 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.390
 variable method by variable we go 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.060
 put the description like we did 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.890
 here behind each method behind every 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.600
 variable so if you do not have 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.460
 understanding during this series the people 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.140
 You will see the variables to that contained in 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.180
 methods that we are creating 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.100
 Sometimes you do not worry that in a little while 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.410
 You will understand how we know the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.410
 our game and it is working but the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.450
 people come here and click on it goes 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.580
 play ball or go play x 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 What happens is that if we stay in 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.830
 up the ball again look what 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.420
 happens between ball x ball ex 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 so what we'll do we'll 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.760
 check if the button text is 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.560
 equal to the emptiness and if it is there then the people 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.390
 let it play in this field but 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.950
 keep a message the user saying 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.780
 this field has already been played 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.570
 so let's see our click method 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.480
 square and here we'll say 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.209
 c button here we'll add one more 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.600
 relatives are going to put a foot on seeing that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.840
 we are recovering our saw jet 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.360
 text the dot and cos is equal to empty 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.660
 then this field has not been played yet 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.640
 Let's vote here, let's close our 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.310
 chÃ¡vez this message here that we 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.959
 prints on the screen telling you which is the afternoon 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.600
 People will not need to use it anymore. 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.209
 but we 'll use her to say 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.130
 then that field has already been played in the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.060
 copy this message here let's talk 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.100
 here o 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.290
 so let's go if the button that people 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.800
 receive here through the trip having a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.850
 cast button if the text of this button is 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.200
 equal to empty then can play but the 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.100
 people will print a message to the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.600
 user saying opa choose another 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000
 square 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.610
 we have performed now we are 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.440
 then sells if it is empty if it is empty 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.959
 let us play it was not us 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.209
 will print the message on the screen post 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.340
 through mei ctex here is our 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.989
 game of the old as we can see no 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.330
 You can play we have to tighten 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.060
 on the play button we do not press the play button 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.989
 and that I'm going now all the buttons let's go 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.270
 click here 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.039
 on a ball let's explain again now 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.700
 comes the message the pope chose another 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.630
 square 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.990
 let's click it 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.610
 are here now vilches here see the ball 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.860
 now what we have to do is 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.980
 check when the game ends when 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.720
 everything is ball or when everything goes x to 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.680
 To do this we will define a 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.330
 matrix 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.800
 inside this matrix we're going to say 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.870
 what are the conditions for the game 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.650
 finish and we'll check every 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.960
 played 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.030
 if the game is over if the game is not over 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.070
 staff for this class is here 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.320
 liked the video gives a jewel shares 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.650
 with friends and I'll see you in the next class 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.890
 Thank you and up to 111 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.890
 the u1
