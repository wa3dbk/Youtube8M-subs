the<00:01:59.330> exhaust<00:01:59.539> with<00:01:59.750> no<00:01:59.869> other<00:01:59.959> change<00:02:00.289> mix

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.120 

I<00:02:05.030> love<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.660> evo<00:02:05.840> 10<00:02:06.110> met<00:02:06.580> my<00:02:07.580> wife<00:02:08.060> was<00:02:09.130> really

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
I love the evo 10 met my wife was really

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.520 
I love the evo 10 met my wife was really
liking<00:02:10.430> this<00:02:10.520> car<00:02:10.790> was<00:02:11.660> kind<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.960> strange<00:02:12.200> sign

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
liking this car was kind of strange sign

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.650 
liking this car was kind of strange sign
because<00:02:13.100> she<00:02:13.250> really<00:02:13.460> hates<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.820> other<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
because she really hates the other the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.490 
because she really hates the other the
other<00:02:14.720> car<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.840> maybe<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.930> could<00:02:18.140> convince<00:02:18.290> her

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
other car so maybe I could convince her

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.210 
other car so maybe I could convince her
to<00:02:18.530> let<00:02:18.650> me<00:02:18.770> buy<00:02:18.950> one

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.840 

push<00:02:22.210> your<00:02:22.360> exhaust<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.070> too<00:02:24.280> loud<00:02:24.490> it's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
push your exhaust is that too loud it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.630 
push your exhaust is that too loud it's
not<00:02:25.000> annoying<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:27.190> not<00:02:27.310> too<00:02:27.490> loud

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
not annoying right it's not too loud

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040 
not annoying right it's not too loud
it's<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:27.910> annoying<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.630> got<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.810> nice

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
it's not annoying but just got a nice

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.040 
it's not annoying but just got a nice
you<00:02:29.760> know<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.330> sports<00:02:31.600> car<00:02:31.870> now

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
you know that you're in a sports car now

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.400 
you know that you're in a sports car now
that's<00:02:32.560> compared<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> stock<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:34.410> they

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
that's compared to the stock one they

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.500 
that's compared to the stock one they
just<00:02:35.530> put<00:02:35.680> my<00:02:35.770> wife<00:02:35.980> ban<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:36.610> we'll<00:02:37.390> get

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
just put my wife ban on here we'll get

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.160 
just put my wife ban on here we'll get
busy<00:02:39.480> alright<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:40.780> we're<00:02:40.870> going<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> do<00:02:41.140> a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
busy alright so now we're going to do a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.160 
busy alright so now we're going to do a
pull<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.390> push<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.570> exhausts<00:02:43.960> on<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pull with the push your exhausts on the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.920 
pull with the push your exhausts on the
car

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
car

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.009 
car
let's<00:02:46.439> see<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.739> kind<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:47.010> power<00:02:47.629> we<00:02:48.629> pick<00:02:48.840> up

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
let's see what kind of power we pick up

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.030 
let's see what kind of power we pick up
I<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.049> sound<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.620> windows<00:02:52.920> open

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
I like the sound of the windows open

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:19.509 
I like the sound of the windows open
here

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:31.059 

okay<00:03:21.079> let's<00:03:22.079> see<00:03:22.260> what<00:03:22.290> happened

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:40.600 

sounds<00:03:31.819> pretty<00:03:31.969> good<00:03:32.180> huh

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.170 

Wow

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
Wow

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.530 
Wow
well<00:03:43.780> we<00:03:43.959> picked<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:44.670> about<00:03:45.670> 5<00:03:45.939> foot<00:03:46.150> pounds<00:03:46.480> of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
well we picked up about 5 foot pounds of

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.270 
well we picked up about 5 foot pounds of
torque<00:03:46.599> with<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.290> same<00:03:47.500> tune<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.040> about

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
torque with the same tune and about

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.839 
torque with the same tune and about
almost<00:03:48.969> 10<00:03:49.150> horsepower<00:03:49.450> went<00:03:49.719> up<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.870> 300

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
almost 10 horsepower went up to 300

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.509 
almost 10 horsepower went up to 300
breathing<00:03:51.849> a<00:03:51.909> lot<00:03:52.030> better<00:03:52.090> up<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.540> top<00:03:53.459> let<00:03:54.459> me

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
breathing a lot better up on top let me

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.069 
breathing a lot better up on top let me
do<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:54.849> more<00:03:54.969> pull<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.510> because<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.900> car

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
do one more pull just because the car

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.599 
do one more pull just because the car
was<00:03:56.109> not<00:03:56.409> even<00:03:56.590> fully<00:03:56.799> warmed<00:03:57.040> up<00:03:57.219> yet<00:03:57.370> we'll

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
was not even fully warmed up yet we'll

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.709 
was not even fully warmed up yet we'll
do<00:03:57.700> one<00:03:57.849> more<00:03:57.939> bull<00:03:58.150> see<00:03:58.299> if<00:03:58.359> it<00:03:58.420> picks<00:03:58.540> up<00:03:58.659> a

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
do one more bull see if it picks up a

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.759 
do one more bull see if it picks up a
little<00:03:58.870> bit<00:03:58.959> more<00:03:59.079> then<00:03:59.260> we'll<00:03:59.349> start<00:03:59.560> tuning

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
little bit more then we'll start tuning

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.199 
little bit more then we'll start tuning
for<00:04:00.099> it<00:04:00.159> gotta<00:04:00.700> make<00:04:00.730> some<00:04:00.969> tuning

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
for it gotta make some tuning

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.020 
for it gotta make some tuning
adjustments<00:04:01.299> for<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.870> but<00:04:01.989> already<00:04:02.139> up<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.379> 300

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
adjustments for it but already up to 300

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.970 
adjustments for it but already up to 300
so<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.239> exhaust<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.689> definitely<00:04:05.049> worth<00:04:05.200> you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
so the exhaust is definitely worth you

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.770 
so the exhaust is definitely worth you
know<00:04:06.099> so<00:04:06.340> far<00:04:06.370> almost<00:04:06.849> 10<00:04:07.180> horsepower<00:04:07.450> just

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
know so far almost 10 horsepower just

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.869 
know so far almost 10 horsepower just
bolting<00:04:08.079> it<00:04:08.139> in<00:04:08.290> let's<00:04:09.129> just<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.609> one<00:04:09.760> more

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
bolting it in let's just do one more

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.839 
bolting it in let's just do one more
poll<00:04:10.180> will<00:04:10.329> let<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.540> car<00:04:10.750> correct<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:12.579> had

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
poll will let the car correct and had

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.190 
poll will let the car correct and had
any<00:04:13.030> timing<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:13.689> will<00:04:13.840> or<00:04:14.019> make

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
any timing that it will or make

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.690 
any timing that it will or make
adjustments<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.920> let<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.159> car<00:04:15.340> warm<00:04:15.370> up

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
adjustments and let the car warm up

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.979 
adjustments and let the car warm up
completely<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.150> will<00:04:16.239> do<00:04:16.329> another<00:04:16.359> full<00:04:16.780> see

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
completely we will do another full see

00:04:16.989 --> 00:05:11.300 
completely we will do another full see
we're<00:04:17.109> at

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.190 

cars<00:05:12.030> not<00:05:13.190> necessarily<00:05:14.840> picking<00:05:15.840> up<00:05:15.930> all<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
cars not necessarily picking up all the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.330 
cars not necessarily picking up all the
power<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.590> we<00:05:16.710> might<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:16.950> think<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.310> really

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
power that we might I think it really

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.890 
power that we might I think it really
needs<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.850> additional<00:05:18.300> tuning<00:05:18.600> but<00:05:18.720> let's

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
needs the additional tuning but let's

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.810 
needs the additional tuning but let's
just<00:05:18.960> take<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.230> look<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.590> that's<00:05:20.520> after<00:05:20.700> we

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
just take a look and that's after we

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.130 
just take a look and that's after we
warmed<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.240> up<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.480> can<00:05:21.600> see<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.840> clearly

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
warmed it up you can see that clearly

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.450 
warmed it up you can see that clearly
over<00:05:22.560> here<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:22.950> starting<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.280> knock<00:05:23.430> a

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
over here it's starting to knock a

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.040 
over here it's starting to knock a
little<00:05:23.670> bit<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.390> low<00:05:24.540> end<00:05:24.660> was<00:05:24.840> going<00:05:24.960> to

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
little bit in the low end was going to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.050 
little bit in the low end was going to
make<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.170> lot<00:05:25.410> more<00:05:25.470> power<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.430> 8<00:05:26.640> the<00:05:26.760> exhaust

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
make a lot more power is 8 the exhaust

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.520 
make a lot more power is 8 the exhaust
and<00:05:27.810> then<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.050> kind<00:05:28.200> of<00:05:28.230> had<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> little

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
and then it kind of had a little

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.580 
and then it kind of had a little
knocking<00:05:28.950> going<00:05:29.100> on<00:05:29.250> there<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.790> then<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:31.500> was

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
knocking going on there and then it was

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.140 
knocking going on there and then it was
very<00:05:31.860> lean<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:32.310> then<00:05:32.520> over<00:05:32.700> here<00:05:32.730> on<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:32.970> top

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
very lean and then over here on the top

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.870 
very lean and then over here on the top
and<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.390> just<00:05:33.570> kills<00:05:33.840> it<00:05:34.220> at<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.460> spot<00:05:35.850> right

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
and it just kills it at that spot right

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.650 
and it just kills it at that spot right
there<00:05:36.120> we're<00:05:36.510> picking<00:05:36.810> up

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.300 

we're<00:06:12.780> making<00:06:12.870> a<00:06:13.050> lot<00:06:13.200> 35<00:06:13.710> more<00:06:13.950> horsepower

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
we're making a lot 35 more horsepower

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.680 
we're making a lot 35 more horsepower
than<00:06:14.340> when<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.610> rolled<00:06:14.820> in<00:06:14.970> over<00:06:15.570> here
