00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.799
If you're going to choose fins, there's many
types of fins, whether it's for your classic

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:19.269
long board fin, you have a long base, which
is giving you a lot of drive, and then you

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.310
have a lot of area in this fin.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.160
So it's holding the board into the face of
the wave.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.500
This is your high performance long board fin.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.210
Now, basically, you can see the different
style of fins.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160
One is taller and skinnier with more rake.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.180
What the rake is, it's giving you projection.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.780
In other words, you can see with these two
fins that this one has much more rake.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680
What the rake does is give you drive down
the line.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.080
It's projecting you down the line of the wave.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.680
Whereas this fin has less rake, so it's more
of a pivot fin.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.579
It wants to go up into the face of the wave.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.400
So all depending on how wide your base is
and how much your rake is, that's what's going

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.080
to determine the performance of your fin.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.380
Now your fins, when the water flow goes around
the fin, this is a double-foiled fin.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.990
It's curved on both sides meeting fifty-fifty
in the center, and so the water flow is going

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.500
around it, holding it down into the face of
the wave, and then releasing off of the trailing

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500
edge.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.100
Now with your basic thruster fin, the side
with the curve goes on the outside, which

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.940
is holding to the face of the wave, and the
flat side, on the inside, is giving you lift

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.700
and helping you hold into the face of the
wave and giving you speed.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.590
And you can see that with thruster fins, same
thing.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.790
The different sizes of the base, and the different
rakes in the angle of the fins, will give

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.030
you different projections, whether you want
to go down the line to pivot turns.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.780
It's all the different types.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.420
These are basically the types of fins you
will get with your stock boards, and then

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.400
you can upgrade your fins.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.440
Now, they make a high tech fin which is a
fiberglass fin with honeycomb inside.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.000
What this does, the honeycomb makes it really
light, so your board is really balanced.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.980
They cost a little bit more but they're worth
the money.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.420
And that is your fins.
