to live and you want to get one of these
controllers<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.250> guys<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> go<00:01:20.670> ahead<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.820> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
controllers you guys can go ahead and do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
controllers you guys can go ahead and do
that<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.869> ship<00:01:22.170> worldwide<00:01:22.500> which

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that and they will ship worldwide which

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.560 
that and they will ship worldwide which
is<00:01:23.310> something<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.150> companies

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is something that a lot of companies

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
is something that a lot of companies
will<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.990> actually<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
will not actually do most of the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the only ship within the u.s. so that's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
the only ship within the u.s. so that's
something<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.670> unique<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.390> dynamic

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
something that's unique about dynamic

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
something that's unique about dynamic
essentials<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.590> also<00:01:31.860> these<00:01:32.100> controllers

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
essentials now also these controllers

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
essentials now also these controllers
come<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> infusion<00:01:33.990> mod<00:01:34.170> which<00:01:34.470> allows

shot and just a bunch of other things
there<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> 10<00:01:39.540> programmable<00:01:40.290> rapid<00:01:40.619> fire

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
there is 10 programmable rapid fire

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
there is 10 programmable rapid fire
modes<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.369> allows<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> change<00:01:42.060> between

really fast or really slow or just kind
of<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> somewhere<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> middle

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of this kind of somewhere in the middle

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.030 
of this kind of somewhere in the middle
which<00:01:45.930> makes<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> controller<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.740> really

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
which makes the controller is really

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
which makes the controller is really
awesome<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.579> call<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> duty<00:01:48.119> GTA<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> what

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
awesome for call of duty GTA and what

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.560 
awesome for call of duty GTA and what
are<00:01:49.259> their<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> FPS<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> games<00:01:51.450> that

are their kind of FPS kind of games that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
are their kind of FPS kind of games that
you<00:01:51.720> guys<00:01:51.840> would<00:01:51.990> possibly<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.470> playing<00:01:52.979> now

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you guys would possibly be playing now

there are a bunch of different modes
that<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> guys<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.439> program<00:01:55.710> when

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that you guys can actually program when

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
that you guys can actually program when
you<00:01:56.280> receive<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.790> these<00:01:56.939> controllers<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you receive one of these controllers and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.090 
you receive one of these controllers and
like<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:57.930> said<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.500> giving<00:01:58.590> four<00:01:59.009> of

like i said i will be giving four of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.319 
like i said i will be giving four of
these<00:01:59.159> controllers<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> ones

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
these controllers of the way the ones

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
these controllers of the way the ones
that<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> video<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.799> of

that are in the video right now and of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.020 
that are in the video right now and of
course<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.250> two<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> they're<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> be

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
course the two that they're going to be

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.340 
course the two that they're going to be
sending<00:02:03.210> me<00:02:03.420> later<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.320> said

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
sending me later on but like i said

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.080 
sending me later on but like i said
there's<00:02:04.710> tons<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> different<00:02:05.250> programmable

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
there's tons of different programmable

like<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.849> said<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> AIS<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
like I said the AIS and like the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.360 
like I said the AIS and like the
pedestrians<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.650> stuff<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.040> now

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
pedestrians and stuff like that now

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.559 
pedestrians and stuff like that now
something<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.060> cool<00:02:24.239> about<00:02:24.360> these

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
something that's really cool about these

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.120 
something that's really cool about these
controllers<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.440> turn<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.010> these

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
controllers you can turn all of these

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.680 
controllers you can turn all of these
features<00:02:26.340> off<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.940> use<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> controllers

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
features off and use the controllers

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.000 
features off and use the controllers
like<00:02:27.750> they're<00:02:27.989> normal<00:02:28.349> or<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.680> guys<00:02:28.800> can

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
like they're normal or you guys can

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
like they're normal or you guys can
actually<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> ahead<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.580> remap<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> the

actually go ahead and remap some of the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually go ahead and remap some of the
buttons<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.080> use<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.410> how<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> guys<00:02:31.920> want
