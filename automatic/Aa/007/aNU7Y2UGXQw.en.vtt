problem<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:44.370> ahead<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.730> try<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.260> i'll

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
problem go ahead and try that but i'll

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
problem go ahead and try that but i'll
open<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.190> image<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.590> show<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> bit<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.550> raw

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
open this image and show a bit what raw

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.459 
open this image and show a bit what raw
therapy<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.920> i'll<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> snapshot<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
therapy can do i'll take a snapshot and

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
therapy can do i'll take a snapshot and
this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.800> taking<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this is just taking it how it is here so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.560 
this is just taking it how it is here so
if<00:00:57.690> i<00:00:57.980> make<00:00:58.980> too<00:00:59.460> many<00:00:59.640> changes<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.359> want<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
if i make too many changes and want to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.470 
if i make too many changes and want to
go<00:01:00.660> back<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> snapshot<00:01:02.480> you've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
go back and can go to a snapshot you've

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.620 
go back and can go to a snapshot you've
got<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.870> exposure<00:01:04.559> options<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.510> if

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
got your exposure options you know if

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
got your exposure options you know if
you<00:01:06.780> want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> brightness<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you want to up the brightness and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.530 
you want to up the brightness and
contrast<00:01:09.020> go<00:01:10.020> ahead<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.770> bit

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
contrast go ahead and do that a bit

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.300 
contrast go ahead and do that a bit
different<00:01:12.540> options<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.380> shadows<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
different options for shadows and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
different options for shadows and
highlights<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> nice<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
highlights that's kind of nice if you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.640 
highlights that's kind of nice if you
want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.930> HDR<00:01:18.930> effect<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
want to do like a HDR effect you can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.850 
want to do like a HDR effect you can
bump<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> shadows<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
bump the shadows up all the way that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.789 
bump the shadows up all the way that
could<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.310> nice<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.720> landscape<00:01:25.500> photos

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
could be nice for some landscape photos

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.660 
could be nice for some landscape photos
go<00:01:28.799> ahead<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:30.360> does<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.780> custom<00:01:31.259> curse

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
go ahead and this does have custom curse

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.830 
go ahead and this does have custom curse
it's<00:01:32.670> nice<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> option<00:01:35.840> take

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it's nice to have that option take

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.609 
it's nice to have that option take
another<00:01:37.140> snapshot<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.430> already<00:01:38.579> see

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
another snapshot so you can already see

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
another snapshot so you can already see
if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.790> forth<00:01:42.439> see<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if you go back and forth see the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
if you go back and forth see the
differences<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:46.850> edit<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
differences will go edit some of the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.719 
differences will go edit some of the
detail<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:51.799> sharpening

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
detail you do have some sharpening

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.920 
detail you do have some sharpening
options<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:57.820> noise<00:01:58.820> reduction<00:01:58.930> for

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
options and noise reduction for

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.910 
options and noise reduction for
luminance<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.619> also<00:02:01.130> for<00:02:01.549> color<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.920> then

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
luminance and also for color and then

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.850 
luminance and also for color and then
we'll<00:02:04.280> come<00:02:04.520> here<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.909> color<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.860> play

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
we'll come here to color you can play

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.600 
we'll come here to color you can play
with<00:02:07.039> temperature<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.759> bit<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.479> can<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.580> does<00:02:10.580> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
with temperature a bit I can do does a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.100 
with temperature a bit I can do does a
pretty<00:02:10.880> good<00:02:11.000> job<00:02:11.150> with<00:02:11.360> auto<00:02:11.780> white<00:02:12.080> balance

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
pretty good job with auto white balance

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.199 
pretty good job with auto white balance
and<00:02:13.870> also<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.290> color<00:02:15.590> boost<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.910> is

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and also it's got color boost this is

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.970 
and also it's got color boost this is
really<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.810> same<00:02:18.080> thing<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.440> saturation

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
really just the same thing as saturation

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.610 
really just the same thing as saturation
I<00:02:19.400> bring<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.330> way<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:21.410> just

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
I bring it down all the way it's just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.860 
I bring it down all the way it's just
your<00:02:22.220> gray<00:02:22.459> scale<00:02:22.760> image<00:02:22.970> if<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.540> want<00:02:23.750> to
