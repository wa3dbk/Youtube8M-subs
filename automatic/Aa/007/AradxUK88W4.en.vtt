00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.659
 greet you dear friends in our 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
 mini course 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.580
 for the most beginners we are with you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 get acquainted with cinema 4d 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.370
 let's go through the most basic elements of the program 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.980
 and at the end of the course we will get a good one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.000
 the result of both learning and the result 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 Trying to start the very beginning of the package 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 cinema 4d is a medium for 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.689
 creating and visualizing three-dimensional 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 objects in the arsenal of cinema 4d 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.770
 There are countless different 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.280
 yummy of course all of them we don't 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.260
 physically will not go for this mini course 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.390
 however for this we will have dedicated 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.469
 separate 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.039
 a huge super course on cinema 4d so 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 cinema 4d 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 on the one hand is very powerful 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.559
 package to create and visualize 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.649
 computer graphics in both movies and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 for different three-dimensional games on the other 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 parties 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.090
 cinema 4d is fully accessible to anyone 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 user on this earth 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 it is also worth mentioning the friendly 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.950
 the program interface , for example, which is not 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 say about other packages like maya or 3d 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.009
 max 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.830
 but of course we'll talk about the interface 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the next lesson 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.130
 Further, I would like to say work 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 the whole course will be done to him all 4d 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.980
 version 15 in cinema 4d 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.800
 as in any similar program is available 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.380
 project system ie every new 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 work is underway in a new project which 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.780
 we have in turn the right to save 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.820
 and define it anywhere on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.650
 hard drive that is it by itself 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.380
 a sure fact but it was necessary 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.110
 mention how to build the most 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.940
 the simplest project now we'll talk 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.100
 before beginning any work well, it does not matter 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.370
 what complexity i will need to have 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.070
 clear and clear idea of ​​how and 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.410
 what should look strongly 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.010
 I recommend to make a couple of pencil 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 drawings 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.580
 in order to simplify our task after which we 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 realize the idea in blue 4d by 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.610
 various tools and special 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280
 objects well and the last step is complete 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.000
 final visualization of the picture or otherwise 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.180
 words render a miscalculation about this of course 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 let's talk separately further conclusion 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.910
 all and 4d can run absolutely any 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.850
 a person without skills 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.830
 work in three-dimensional space however 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.860
 he will of course need 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.260
 partial basic theory and smallness 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.340
 practice what we do in this 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.110
 mini course let's get started 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.170
 in this lesson we will go through 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.030
 the program interface and tell about each 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.040
 important corner of the program 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 so that you have the full picture 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.680
 of where and where to poke in the case 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.989
 need immediately after opening 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.800
 programs to our gaze represent 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.110
 the next picture is in the middle 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.330
 the largest window is the window in and side 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.819
 in our case, the viewport window has 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.310
 side view 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.379
 that is, the prospect we can contemplate 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.069
 it's in the top left of our window 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.310
 viewport and here we will contemplate 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.409
 again your whole project 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.019
 all that we will change will 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.150
 display directly in the window in 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.030
 port as well 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.459
 window in and port will serve as our window 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.230
 temporary visualization is very 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.230
 interesting thing believe my dear 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.499
 friends and who in turn I 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.139
 tell in full super course on blue 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:04:00.819
 4d beach further look on the right 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.489
 the top of our 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.030
 the right side of the interface takes 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.739
 object list manager 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.010
 here we will see absolutely 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.000
 each object of the composition that in that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.359
 or another measure 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.789
 involved in the scene also available 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.330
 ability to delete and move objects 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.479
 in this list below under the manager 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.979
 list we have perhaps the most popular 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.810
 manager is an object attribute manager 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:35.110
 when we click on this or that 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.050
 Let the object be a cube or 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.030
 light source then in attribute managers 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.599
 we will see all available for 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.810
 editing the setting of the object itself 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:49.930
 such settings are absolutely inherent 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.400
 each element and cinema 4d are watching 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.240
 to the left 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.690
 under port 2 there is a time scale 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.060
 she is of course in our frames 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.020
 that is, we see from 0 to 100 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.419
 This is the footage that I want to say all these 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.580
 parts of the interface and also we have by the way 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.139
 saying time controls then 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.330
 there is a rewind pause 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.599
 also key saving items 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.940
 animations all these parts of the interface to us 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.250
 will be exclusively available in 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.800
 case of working with animation ie 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.040
 moving some elements of ours 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.710
 compositions 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.790
 below the timeline we have a manager 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.620
 materials are probably the same 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.590
 popular manager in cinema 4d 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.300
 here we will learn how to create 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.760
 own material for any object 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.360
 cinema 4d 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:49.320
 crawling up above the window in and port we have 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.120
 top toolbar of which 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.690
 which consists of special objects 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.350
 in various key tools 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:01.350
 visualization and some blockers 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.840
 in detail about each item you can 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.380
 look in our super cinema course 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.770
 4d 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.170
 however, here I will tell the important 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.640
 higher above the toolbar we have 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.490
 tab bar 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.460
 in fact its all tabs in the print itself 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.500
 those elements that we have them as in 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.150
 main toolbar so in 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.960
 object attribute manager 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.950
 well and finally left we have a panel 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.730
 editing 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.450
 units of a three-dimensional object such units 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:36.270
 as polygons edges and points thoroughly 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.030
 everything about this will be explained in the chapter on 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.580
 complex polygonal modeling 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.890
 three-dimensional objects in our super course 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.150
 by cinema 4d 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.580
 here is the whole interface 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.760
 programs agree all he looks and 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.890
 located harmoniously and smoothly however 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.020
 After years of work in this program have 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.479
 you will often have a feeling in 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.240
 lack of some commonly used 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.520
 elements and in such cases we resort 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.700
 to customize 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.580
 interface about how to build your own from scratch 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.590
 cinema 4d interface we'll also talk in 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.350
 super course on cinema 4d 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.880
 well and we go to the next lesson where 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.220
 I will tell you how we can 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.770
 interact with windows 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.770
 so with cinema 4d objects
