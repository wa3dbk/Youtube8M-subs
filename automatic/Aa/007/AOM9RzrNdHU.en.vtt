00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
â™ª

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
LETTER BOXING IS A FORM OF

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
TREASURE HUNTING THAT UTILIZE'S

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
FOODS THAT ARE FOUND ON THE --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
CLUES FOUND ON THE INTERNET.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
FIRST YOU NEED TO PRINT OR

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
WRITE YOUR DIRECTIONS.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
YOU CAN STYLES USE YOUR

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
SMARTPHONE BUT THE SIGNAL

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK WELL IN

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
WOODED AREAS.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
YOU NEED YOUR OWN STAMP, EITHER

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
CARVE YOURS OR PURCHASE YOURS,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
WITH INK OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
MINE'S GREEN.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A JOURNAL TO POST ALL OF YOUR

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
FAVORITE STAMPS YOU ENCOUNTER,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
ALL THE LETTER BOXES.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A COUPLE OF WRITING UTENSILS TO

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
LEAVE BEHIND SOME NOTES.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
TO SHOW YOU THE FUN.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
SHOULD I DO THAT AGAIN?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
WE'RE GOING TO FIND ONE IN

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
PROVIDENCE.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
HEAD TO YOUR LOCATION, AND GET

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
READY TO HUNT.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THE FIRST CLUE SAYS YOU HAVE TO

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
WALK ALONG THE PATH BY THE

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
RIVER, AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
PLACE WHERE YOU NEED TO SCRAMBLE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
OVER TWO LARGE TREES THAT ARE

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
UPROOTED AND HAVE FALLEN OVER.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
TIME TO HIT THE TRAIL.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.666
HERE'S THE FIRST UPROOTED

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
TREE.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
AND HERE'S THE SECOND.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
SO, IT'S TIME TO GET SCRAMBLING.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.933
HOPEFULLY YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
CLUE.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I FOUND THE FIRST TREE!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.333
IT SAYS, LOOK UP THE

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
HILLSIDE.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.133
FOR A SINGLE MEDIUM-SIZED BEACH.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
UH-OH.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I HOPE THEY MEANT BIRCH, BECAUSE

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I KNOW WHAT A BIRCH IS.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
A SINGLE MEDIUM-SIZED BEECH.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
SINGLE?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
THIS IS A DOUBLEMENT -- DOUBLE.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK WHAT TREES

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
ARE BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
THERE'S A LOT OF TREES.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS, I'M

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
GOING TO GOOGLE WHAT A BEECH

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
TREE LOOKS LIKE.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
BEECH TREE, IMAGES!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
USE GOOGLE.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
KEEP OH AN EYE OUT FOR PLANTS

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
YOU MAY BE ALLERGIC TO, AND PICK

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
UP A WALKING STICK.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I FEEL LIKE GANDOLF, THE

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
WALKING STICK.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
OH, MY GOD, WE FOUND IT!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
ALWAYS USE CAUTION.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'M GOING TO STICK IN MY

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
STICK AND KIND OF WIPE OFF ANY

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
SPIDERWEBS AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
NOBODY'S HOME.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
THE BEST PART IS FIRST OPENING

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.066
IT UP AND SEEING WHAT THE STAMP

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
LOOKS LIKE.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
THIS ONE WAS A CUTE ONE.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
THIS IS A JOURNAL.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
GENERALLY THE FIRST PAGE OF A

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
JOURNAL IS A STAMP OF THE STAMP

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
THAT WAS WITH THE LETTER BOX.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.133
THEN IT ALSO SAYS WHO PLANTED IT

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
AND WHEN.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
INK UP YOUR PERSONAL STAMP

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.333
AND LEAVE YOUR MARK.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
OH!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND SEE

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
WHO'S ALREADY FOUND IT.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.866
THESE ARE THEIR OWN PERSONAL

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
STAMPS.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
STEAMS PEOPLE LEAVE LITTLE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
MESSAGES AND WHAT DATE THEY DID

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
IT AND WHERE THEY'RE FROM.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
NOW STAMP THE LETTER BOX

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
STAMP INSIDE YOUR OWN PERSONAL

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
JOURNAL.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
AND NOW I'LL WRITE THE DATE

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THAT I FOUND IT AND WHERE.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT IT

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
BACK CAREFULLY.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO EXPLORE

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
THE OUTDOORS.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
REMEMBER, LETTER BOXING IS

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
MEANT TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
FRIENDLY ACTIVITY.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
DON'T DESTROY NATURE WHEN YOU'RE

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
FINDING OR HIDING A BOX.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
AND REMEMBER TO KEEP THE AREA

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
CLEANER THAN YOU FOUND IT.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
LETTER BOXES CAN ALSO BE IN

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
URBAN ENVIRONMENTS.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
IT'S THE SAME PROCESS.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
FOLLOW YOUR CLUES.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
CHICK TRICKY, TRICKY,.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
SOMETIMES THE LETTER BOXES

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
ARE HID IN CRACKS OR UNDER

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
ROCKS.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400
THERE'S A LARGE ROCK.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
OOH, YEAH.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
THAT RIGHT THERE IS A LETTER

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
BOX.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
LET'S GO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
NOW, WHEN I FIND A LETTER BOX

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
IN A REALLY PUBLIC PLACE, I LIKE

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
TO BRING IT FAR AWAY FROM WHERE

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I FOUND IT TO RECORD THE FIND.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
THAT WAY PEOPLE DON'T GO

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
SNOOPING.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
THIS STAMP WAS EGYPTIAN

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THEMED.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AFTER STAMPING AND WRITING IN

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
THE JOURNALS, IT WAS TIME TO PUT

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
THE LETTER BOX BACK.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
JUST TO MAKE SURE NOBODY'S

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
WATCHING YOU!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
LIKE THAT LADY RIGHT THRT.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
AND LEAVE IT JUST LIKE IT WAS

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
BEFORE.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
SHH!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THOSE LETTER BOXES WERE

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
ACTUALLY FOUND IN PROVIDENCE,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.466
AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
TO LEARN BHOR THIS FUN HOBBY AND

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
WHERE YOU CAN FIND LOCAL LETTER
