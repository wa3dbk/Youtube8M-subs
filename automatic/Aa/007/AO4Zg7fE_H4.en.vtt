 I can only say the following 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 makes about a third of the acoustic 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.320

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 I think today's video is mine 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.850
 a topic that is personal to me right 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.270
 important is harder than good so yes 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.340
 First of all we can do it 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 wanted to address a cause today 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.789
 Personally, I'm very important when we do that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.640
 I noticed this lately 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.259
 things that do in your life if 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.360

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.130

 For example, you have the power of success 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.289
 I'm here now but I notice 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.330
 also that we only do something 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.220

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.929

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.239
