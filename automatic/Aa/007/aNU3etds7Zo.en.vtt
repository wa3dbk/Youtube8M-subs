I love walk in the sand let's have a
look<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.059> flutter<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.479> was<00:01:03.600> sitting<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
look at this flutter that was sitting in

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
look at this flutter that was sitting in
the<00:01:04.170> run<00:01:04.290> outside<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.339> catch<00:01:05.519> him<00:01:05.700> today

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.050 

before<00:01:30.220> we<00:01:30.310> head<00:01:30.400> over<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.760> our<00:01:30.820> favorite

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
before we head over to our favorite

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.610 
before we head over to our favorite
Widing<00:01:31.570> grounds<00:01:31.900> we<00:01:31.990> thought<00:01:32.170> we'd<00:01:32.320> test<00:01:32.500> our

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
Widing grounds we thought we'd test our

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.500 
Widing grounds we thought we'd test our
new<00:01:32.980> underwater<00:01:33.370> camera<00:01:33.790> cases<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.300> see<00:01:34.420> how

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
new underwater camera cases and see how

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.600 
new underwater camera cases and see how
they<00:01:34.630> work<00:01:34.780> underwater<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:36.160> course<00:01:36.400> try

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
they work underwater and of course try

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.090 
they work underwater and of course try
and<00:01:36.730> catch<00:01:36.880> some<00:01:37.060> fish<00:01:37.300> Deba<00:01:38.230> 9<00:01:38.440> is<00:01:38.650> flatted

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
and catch some fish Deba 9 is flatted

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.370 
and catch some fish Deba 9 is flatted
now<00:01:39.580> quickly<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.090> buries<00:01:40.420> itself<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.050> becomes

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
now quickly it buries itself and becomes

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.810 
now quickly it buries itself and becomes
one<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.950> environment<00:01:42.430> now<00:01:42.520> one<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.670> these

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
one of the environment now one of these

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.470 
one of the environment now one of these
such<00:01:43.030> good<00:01:43.300> predators<00:01:45.210> watching<00:01:46.210> live<00:01:46.360> around

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
such good predators watching live around

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.810 
such good predators watching live around
sandy<00:01:47.110> weedy<00:01:47.350> beds<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.040> unfortunately<00:01:48.610> say

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
sandy weedy beds and unfortunately say

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.310 
sandy weedy beds and unfortunately say
that<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.060> Pickers<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.540> these<00:01:49.690> small<00:01:50.020> brim

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
that the Pickers like these small brim

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
that the Pickers like these small brim
so<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.130> got<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.340> weed<00:01:51.490> through<00:01:51.520> all<00:01:51.790> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so you got to weed through all the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.720 
so you got to weed through all the
smaller<00:01:53.170> fish<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.440> get<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.800> these<00:01:54.040> big<00:01:54.310> whiting

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
smaller fish to get to these big whiting

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.090 
smaller fish to get to these big whiting
so<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.390> got<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.690> have<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.840> fair<00:01:56.050> few<00:01:56.290> amount<00:01:56.980> of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
so you got to have a fair few amount of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.940 
so you got to have a fair few amount of
nippers<00:01:57.370> with<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.020> time<00:01:59.260> to<00:01:59.290> test

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
nippers with you so it's time to test

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.440 
nippers with you so it's time to test
our<00:02:00.130> luck<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.490> see<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.150> pull<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.360> a

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
our luck and see if we can pull in a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:23.819 
our luck and see if we can pull in a
couple<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.720> big<00:02:01.840> ones

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.410 

Vonnie<00:02:24.829> hooked<00:02:25.099> onto<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.430> nice<00:02:25.730> 44

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
Vonnie hooked onto this nice 44

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.119 
Vonnie hooked onto this nice 44
centimeter<00:02:26.930> whiting<00:02:27.379> then<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.739> get<00:02:27.950> much

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
centimeter whiting then I get much

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.839 
centimeter whiting then I get much
bigger<00:02:28.310> than<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
bigger than that

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.460 
bigger than that
I<00:02:28.879> have<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.569> have<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.720> look<00:02:29.840> at<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:29.989> records<00:02:30.379> but

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
I have to have a look at the records but

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.140

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.149 

unfortunately<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.439> pickers<00:02:50.709> got<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:50.950> best

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
unfortunately the pickers got the best

unfortunately the pickers got the best
of<00:02:51.310> us<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.879> still<00:02:52.150> had<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.329> nice<00:02:52.629> run<00:02:52.900> inside

of us and we still had a nice run inside
to<00:02:53.340> fish<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.849> decided<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.299> go<00:02:55.420> out<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629
