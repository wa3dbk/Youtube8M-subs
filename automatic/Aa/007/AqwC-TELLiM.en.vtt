one<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.830> much<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> wood<00:01:11.729> saw

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

carbon<00:01:22.470> steel<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> unusual<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
carbon steel what is unusual is the

weight on this thing as you can see we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
weight on this thing as you can see we
are<00:01:27.450> talking<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:28.049> nearly<00:01:28.409> 10<00:01:28.979> ounces<00:01:29.610> which

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
are talking about nearly 10 ounces which

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
are talking about nearly 10 ounces which
happens<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.600> quite<00:01:30.810> heavy<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> knife

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
happens to be quite heavy for a knife

Desai's<00:01:32.640> let's<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> quick<00:01:33.780> comparison

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
Desai's let's make a quick comparison

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.249 
Desai's let's make a quick comparison
with<00:01:34.619> another<00:01:34.740> knife<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.759> roughly<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.900> same

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
with another knife of roughly the same

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.030 
with another knife of roughly the same
size<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> Mora<00:01:38.840> companion<00:01:40.040> military

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
size this is the Mora companion military

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
size this is the Mora companion military
knife<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> same

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
knife as well and it's about the same

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.999 
knife as well and it's about the same
size<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.610> only<00:01:44.909> three<00:01:45.509> point<00:01:46.320> two

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
size but it's only three point two

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.760 
size but it's only three point two
ounces<00:01:47.790> size<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.840> roughly<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.290> same<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
ounces size is roughly the same as I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980 
ounces size is roughly the same as I
said<00:01:50.009> even<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> handles<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.450> roughly<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
said even the handles are roughly the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.590 
said even the handles are roughly the
same<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> few<00:01:54.270> times

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
same so as you can see it's a few times

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.700 
same so as you can see it's a few times
heavier<00:01:55.200> than<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.520> average<00:01:56.939> knife<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:58.320> came

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
heavier than the average knife it came

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350

rubberized guard with metal inside as
you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.750> imagine<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.299> protect<00:02:06.930> your

the gas if you can cut yourself from

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
fantastic design another feature that I

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.059 
fantastic design another feature that I
like<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.329> extremely<00:03:07.930> tough<00:03:08.170> insert<00:03:08.799> it

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
like is the extremely tough insert it

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.850 
like is the extremely tough insert it
came<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:10.000> keep<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.690> knife<00:03:10.900> tightly<00:03:11.590> in

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
came with to keep the knife tightly in

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.550 
came with to keep the knife tightly in
and<00:03:12.130> perhaps<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.760> most<00:03:12.970> interesting<00:03:13.690> feature

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and perhaps the most interesting feature

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.629 
and perhaps the most interesting feature
of<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.250> knife<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:16.239> price<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:17.290> way<00:03:17.920> way

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
of this knife is it's price is way way

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.539 
of this knife is it's price is way way
more<00:03:19.090> affordable<00:03:19.569> than<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.440> competition<00:03:21.010> and

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
more affordable than the competition and

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.000 
more affordable than the competition and
guess<00:03:22.030> what<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.480> competition<00:03:22.870> being<00:03:23.739> this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
guess what the competition being this

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.690 
guess what the competition being this
guy<00:03:24.489> copied<00:03:25.030> almost<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:26.200> full<00:03:26.410> extent<00:03:27.310> what

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
guy copied almost in full extent what

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.390 
guy copied almost in full extent what
the<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> set<00:03:28.389> is<00:03:28.750> probably<00:03:29.380> some<00:03:29.889> of<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.130> might

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the a set is probably some of you might

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.809 
the a set is probably some of you might
argue<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.630> Gerber<00:03:32.319> lmf<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.549> better

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
argue the Gerber lmf it's a better

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.819 
argue the Gerber lmf it's a better
looking<00:03:34.239> noise<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.750> probably<00:03:35.410> you'll<00:03:35.680> be

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
looking noise and probably you'll be

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.240 
looking noise and probably you'll be
right<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:36.579> it's<00:03:36.790> way<00:03:37.180> more<00:03:37.540> expensive<00:03:38.440> and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
right but it's way more expensive and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.250 
right but it's way more expensive and
you<00:03:39.459> can<00:03:39.639> get<00:03:39.790> pretty<00:03:39.970> much<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.480> same<00:03:40.780> usage

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
you can get pretty much the same usage

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.849 
you can get pretty much the same usage
out<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
out of it

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.460 
out of it
do<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.819> asic<00:03:43.209> better<00:03:43.750> than<00:03:44.049> any<00:03:44.200> other

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
do I like the asic better than any other

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.910 
do I like the asic better than any other
options<00:03:45.040> probably<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:46.060> because<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.319> has<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
options probably I do because it has a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.190 
options probably I do because it has a
couple<00:03:48.310> characteristics<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.359> like<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:50.019> is

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
couple characteristics that I like it is

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.229 
couple characteristics that I like it is
an<00:03:50.319> extremely<00:03:50.709> high<00:03:50.920> quality<00:03:50.980> knife<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.970> an

extremely low price that makes this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.930 
extremely low price that makes this
knife<00:03:55.329> one<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.109> best<00:03:56.410> deals<00:03:56.739> on<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.700> north
