00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.970
 all right 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.879
 for this design that I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.650
 then it is previously 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.390
 prepared our natural nail with everything 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.820
 the procedure brand us ávila 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.740
 indicates let's work a design with 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.830
 the following leader of the line abr and 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.739
 we're going to use the silver leader the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.360
 glider min and the litmus glider these 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.279
 lides are already mixed in these 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.760
 glass cups that must be a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.859
 part of the leader by three acrylic 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 let's perform the extension of the bed 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:42.640
 of the nail with the acrylic make overs 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.469
 we apply we start how to give our 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 acrylic carrying the product from side to 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.420
 side and pushing it towards the center to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.869
 perform the extension of the bed of the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.010
 a 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.489
 remember that here what we are 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.949
 doing is marking and defining the smile 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.960
 in order to define the smile we are 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.329
 pushing with the lateral bristles of 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.330
 our brush and holding the brush 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.399
 in a horizontal position the brushes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.429
 of the ávila brand are high brushes 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.830
 quality since its kolinsky and 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:16.229
 they allow us to make applications without 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 that the bristles of the brush get dirty 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.880
 let's apply the glider silver what 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.380
 we apply in the smile and we're going to 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.380
 carry towards the inserts 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.010
 let's apply the slider min 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.650
 we gently diffuse it towards our 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.650
 Silver leader to miss the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.320
 division of colors and at the tip 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.380
 let's apply the litmus glider what 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.200
 we apply and we will blur it towards 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.870
 our min leader to be able to make a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.060
 blur of three colors if they are fixed 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.970
 is the brand leader opened the umbrellas 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.660
 high quality because they have a brightness 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.660
 spectacular 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.649
 we are going to encapsulate the nail with the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.649
 acrylic clean we have a small 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.359
 perlita we apply it and we are going to start 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.670
 our way encapsulation 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.670
 traditional as we always do 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.530
 we removed the form for sculpture with 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 our grain file without 100 we are going to 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.850
 start filing to shape 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.730
 always starting to achieve a good 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.730
 quadrature by the sides and the tip 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 we must remove the scratches from 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.830
 the previous file with our lime 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.590
 brillã stones 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.860
 with a brush for manicure we remove 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 the excess dust and we take a name is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.570
 We're going to moisten it with our liquid 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.000
 sanz and remove two in one that contains a 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.090
 pleasant aroma and it prevents us from drying the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090
 skin 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.470
 we are going to use a double burden of 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.440
 white and pink and we're going to work a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.960
 basic little flower we make a stroke 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.480
 basic round with a double load of 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.209
 white and pink 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.670
 let's take a double charge again 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.760
 of white and pink to work another 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.910
 half flower just working our 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.020
 round stroke 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.390
 we make a basic sheet using the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.670
 green color at the bottom and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.800
 yellow on top 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.950
 we press and turn we make a 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.510
 long stroke down to be able to leave 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.879
 our little flower finished 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.620
 finally with the yellow color with 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.200
 our acrylic paint and help from a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.400
 punch let's put some small 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 little dots in the center of our flowers 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.459
 let's apply a few dots in tone 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.230
 white in the cuticle area with 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.170
 white acrylic paint is very 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.230
 important that these dots are in 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.530
 series and that go from the largest towards 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.650
 the smallest 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.540
 let's give finished with finish gel what 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.300
 we apply from the cuticle area 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.209
 towards the tip covering perfectly 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.480
 the acrylic paint sealing very well 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.630
 the sides and the front of the one this 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.420
 is to give an excellent finished 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.040
 we introduce in our lamp two to 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.710
 three minutes 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.840
 We apply cuticle oil to 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.740
 moisturize the skin and terminate 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.740
 this design
