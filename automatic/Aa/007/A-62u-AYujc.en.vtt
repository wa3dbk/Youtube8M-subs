narrow passageways there are a lot of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.149 
narrow passageways there are a lot of
trouble<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:24.420> height<00:01:24.659> restriction<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> lot

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
trouble the height restriction is a lot

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
trouble the height restriction is a lot
of<00:01:26.310> trouble<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.850> didn't<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.540> about

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
of trouble I didn't really think about

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
of trouble I didn't really think about
that<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.200> advance<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.920> being<00:01:29.189> shorter<00:01:29.670> makes

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that in advance but being shorter makes

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
that in advance but being shorter makes
things<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.540> difficult<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
things much more difficult I think the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
things much more difficult I think the
number<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.790> point<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> would<00:01:33.810> make<00:01:33.960> two

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
number one point that I would make two

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
number one point that I would make two
though<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.270> understand<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
though is I understand i can get out of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
though is I understand i can get out of
this<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> seat<00:01:38.040> whenever<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.670> to
