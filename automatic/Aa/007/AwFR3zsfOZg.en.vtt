00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
something else that might be a little

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.270

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.640 
good we were so behind everyone else and
we've<00:04:57.710> played<00:04:57.920> in<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.130> last<00:04:58.340> P<00:04:59.240> Co<00:04:59.450> Q<00:04:59.780> or<00:05:00.080> P<00:05:00.110> CL

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650

we've played in the last P Co Q or P CL
and<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.250> can't<00:05:01.550> remember<00:05:01.760> what<00:05:01.910> they<00:05:02.000> were

called<00:05:02.300> back<00:05:02.480> then<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:04.250> guess<00:05:04.640> it<00:05:04.910> would<00:05:05.000> be<00:05:05.030> a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
called back then I guess it would be a

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.110 
called back then I guess it would be a
PC<00:05:05.480> L<00:05:05.570> because<00:05:05.780> P<00:05:05.930> Co<00:05:06.110> Q<00:05:06.350> stands<00:05:06.620> for<00:05:07.120> online
