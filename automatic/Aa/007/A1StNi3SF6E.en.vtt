00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
literally all the roots that I could

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.970

going to be planting anything else in
there<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.930> snuck<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> landscape<00:02:12.950> fabric

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
there I snuck down the landscape fabric

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.050 
there I snuck down the landscape fabric
and<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:14.450> worked<00:02:14.630> pretty<00:02:14.870> well<00:02:15.670> except<00:02:16.670> right

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and that worked pretty well except right

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.550 
and that worked pretty well except right
around<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.330> corners<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.960> see<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.260> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
around the corners you can see it it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.260 
around the corners you can see it it
just<00:02:18.800> kept<00:02:19.010> shooting<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.550> but<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.090> keep

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
just kept shooting up but if you keep

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.680 
just kept shooting up but if you keep
spraying<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.140> eventually<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.620> goes<00:02:21.770> away<00:02:22.690> or

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
spraying it eventually it goes away or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.930 
spraying it eventually it goes away or
it<00:02:24.050> seems<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.620> gone<00:02:24.740> away<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.520> comes<00:02:25.730> up

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
it seems to have gone away it comes up

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.730 
it seems to have gone away it comes up
there<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.690> corner<00:02:27.020> between<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.470> beds<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
there in the corner between the beds the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.000 
there in the corner between the beds the
other<00:02:31.280> concern<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.120> people<00:02:32.240> who<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:33.470> beds

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
other concern for people who have beds

woodchips but I'll keep having issues
the<00:02:55.910> majority<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.900> Augustine<00:02:57.290> but

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the majority of this is in Augustine but

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.630 
the majority of this is in Augustine but
you<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.590> see<00:02:57.770> there's<00:02:57.950> some<00:02:58.070> Bermuda<00:02:58.250> grass

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
you can see there's some Bermuda grass

you can see there's some Bermuda grass
worked<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.090> there<00:02:59.240> with<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.930> I've<00:03:00.290> got

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
worked in there with it and I've got

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.910 
worked in there with it and I've got
some<00:03:00.650> more<00:03:00.770> in<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.980> front<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.400> garden<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
some more in the front of the garden the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.850 
some more in the front of the garden the
one<00:03:04.610> thing<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.060> trying<00:03:05.510> now<00:03:05.960> and<00:03:06.800> I

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
one thing that I'm trying now and I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.910 
one thing that I'm trying now and I
don't<00:03:07.070> know<00:03:07.190> how<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.580> will<00:03:07.730> work<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.470> where<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
don't know how it will work is where the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920 
don't know how it will work is where the
woodchips<00:03:10.490> meet<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.480> fence

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
woodchips meet the fence

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.580 
woodchips meet the fence
I've<00:03:12.530> been<00:03:12.770> putting<00:03:12.980> down<00:03:13.280> salt<00:03:14.350> for<00:03:15.350> two

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
I've been putting down salt for two

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.160 
I've been putting down salt for two
reasons<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.300> don't<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.959> go<00:03:18.080> in

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
reasons one so I don't have to go in

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.480 
reasons one so I don't have to go in
there<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.320> weed<00:03:18.560> whack<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.830> fence<00:03:22.250> line

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
there in weed whack the the fence line

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.210 
there in weed whack the the fence line
is<00:03:22.940> it's<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:23.780> time<00:03:24.350> consuming<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.920> annoying

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
is it's just time consuming and annoying

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.760 
is it's just time consuming and annoying
and<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.690> other<00:03:26.840> reason<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.260> I'm<00:03:27.380> hoping<00:03:27.650> to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
and the other reason is I'm hoping to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.830 
and the other reason is I'm hoping to
sterilize<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.430> soil<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.360> can<00:03:29.390> see<00:03:29.660> all<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
sterilize the soil you can see all the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.560 
sterilize the soil you can see all the
Bermuda<00:03:30.140> grass<00:03:30.350> here<00:03:31.180> I'm<00:03:32.180> hoping<00:03:32.450> to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
Bermuda grass here I'm hoping to

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.690 
Bermuda grass here I'm hoping to
sterilize<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.170> soil<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.709> way<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.430> keeps

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
sterilize the soil so that way it keeps

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.010 
sterilize the soil so that way it keeps
the<00:03:34.820> remuda<00:03:35.090> grass<00:03:35.330> from<00:03:35.570> sending<00:03:35.900> any

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
the remuda grass from sending any

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.630 
the remuda grass from sending any
runners<00:03:36.410> into<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.820> garden<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:40.100> we'll<00:03:40.310> see<00:03:40.490> how

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
runners into the garden so we'll see how

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.550 
runners into the garden so we'll see how
this<00:03:40.790> works<00:03:41.090> I'll<00:03:41.930> give<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.200> guys<00:03:42.290> an<00:03:42.440> update

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
get established it's really hard to get

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.809 
get established it's really hard to get
rid<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> very<00:03:53.120> big<00:03:53.810> pain<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.290> butt
