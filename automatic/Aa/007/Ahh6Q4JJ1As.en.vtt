00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
thing that really kind of bothers me

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.570 
thing that really kind of bothers me
about<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.439> not<00:05:38.590> so<00:05:38.830> much<00:05:39.009> the<00:05:39.219> the<00:05:39.460> whole

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
about it not so much the the whole

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.219 
about it not so much the the whole
cliffhanger<00:05:40.180> ending<00:05:40.509> thing<00:05:40.719> but<00:05:40.960> it's<00:05:41.080> more

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
cliffhanger ending thing but it's more

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.969 
cliffhanger ending thing but it's more
so<00:05:41.499> the<00:05:41.529> fact<00:05:41.979> that<00:05:42.300> there<00:05:43.300> isn't<00:05:43.689> as<00:05:43.900> much

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
so the fact that there isn't as much

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.950 
so the fact that there isn't as much
spooky<00:05:44.979> stuff<00:05:45.249> as<00:05:45.490> there<00:05:45.699> was<00:05:45.849> in<00:05:45.879> the<00:05:46.389> first

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
spooky stuff as there was in the first

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.559 
spooky stuff as there was in the first
episode<00:05:47.340> so<00:05:48.340> comparing<00:05:48.969> it<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.240> first

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
episode so comparing it to the first

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.279 
episode so comparing it to the first
episode<00:05:50.139> it's<00:05:50.499> a<00:05:50.770> little<00:05:51.039> tame<00:05:51.750> but<00:05:52.750> overall<00:05:53.110> I

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
episode it's a little tame but overall I

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.279 
episode it's a little tame but overall I
think<00:05:53.650> it<00:05:53.800> was<00:05:53.919> fun<00:05:54.810> some<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:55.990> labyrinth

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
think it was fun some of the labyrinth

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.929 
think it was fun some of the labyrinth
areas<00:05:56.800> were<00:05:56.949> pretty<00:05:57.159> interesting<00:05:57.699> in<00:05:57.849> the

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
areas were pretty interesting in the

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.080 
areas were pretty interesting in the
caves<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.449> custom<00:05:58.840> enemies<00:05:59.199> and<00:05:59.819> the<00:06:00.819> custom

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
caves the custom enemies and the custom

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.670 
caves the custom enemies and the custom
enemies<00:06:01.360> looked<00:06:01.569> creepy<00:06:02.050> though<00:06:02.379> so<00:06:02.590> i'll

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
enemies looked creepy though so i'll

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.200 
enemies looked creepy though so i'll
give<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.219> game<00:06:03.340> that<00:06:03.610> they<00:06:03.879> looked<00:06:04.120> pretty

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
give the game that they looked pretty

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.029 
give the game that they looked pretty
they<00:06:04.659> looked<00:06:04.870> pretty<00:06:04.960> nice<00:06:05.349> Oh<00:06:07.800> see<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:08.830> went
