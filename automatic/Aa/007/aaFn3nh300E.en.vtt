what<00:00:04.470> would<00:00:04.620> happen<00:00:05.210> if<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.450> take<00:00:06.630> a<00:00:06.689> balloon

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
what would happen if we take a balloon

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.820 
what would happen if we take a balloon
fill<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:08.940> helium<00:00:09.209> and<00:00:09.809> huh<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.410> put<00:00:10.680> it

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
fill it with helium and huh and put it

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.350 
fill it with helium and huh and put it
in<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.040> cow

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.220 

there's<00:00:14.360> our<00:00:14.480> car<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:16.130> drive<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.760> car

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
there's our car and we drive the car

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.190 
there's our car and we drive the car
into<00:00:18.230> a<00:00:18.410> wall<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.280> stops<00:00:19.670> what<00:00:20.510> happens<00:00:20.930> to

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
into a wall so it stops what happens to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.190 
into a wall so it stops what happens to
that<00:00:21.320> balloon<00:00:21.650> I<00:00:21.950> reckon<00:00:22.850> my<00:00:23.810> suppose<00:00:24.050> our

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
that balloon I reckon my suppose our

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200 
that balloon I reckon my suppose our
cars<00:00:24.380> everything<00:00:24.770> goes<00:00:25.070> forwards<00:00:25.670> when<00:00:26.090> you

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
cars everything goes forwards when you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.670 
cars everything goes forwards when you
suddenly<00:00:26.599> slow<00:00:26.779> on<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:26.990> anchors<00:00:27.260> yeah<00:00:27.439> I

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
suddenly slow on the anchors yeah I

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.369 
suddenly slow on the anchors yeah I
think<00:00:27.950> there's<00:00:28.189> only<00:00:28.250> one<00:00:28.369> way<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.610> find<00:00:28.789> out

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.950 

that's<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.499> bit<00:00:33.649> fruity

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.259 

no<00:00:39.589> but<00:00:39.769> I<00:00:40.010> understand<00:00:40.820> why<00:00:40.909> y'all<00:00:41.089> messing

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
no but I understand why y'all messing

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.099 
no but I understand why y'all messing
around<00:00:41.479> here

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
around here

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.689 
around here
there<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:42.649> why<00:00:42.979> am<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.159> doing<00:00:43.219> this<00:00:43.429> with

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
there but why am I doing this with

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.810 
there but why am I doing this with
normals<00:00:44.030> it's<00:00:44.239> hard<00:00:44.449> a<00:00:45.309> bigger<00:00:46.309> friggin<00:00:46.699> dear

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
normals it's hard a bigger friggin dear

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.849 
normals it's hard a bigger friggin dear
prophet<00:00:47.089> scientific<00:00:47.659> experiment<00:00:48.199> we<00:00:48.649> need<00:00:48.680> to

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
prophet scientific experiment we need to

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:49.420 
prophet scientific experiment we need to
control

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
control

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.340 
control
we've<00:00:49.909> got<00:00:50.000> helium<00:00:50.329> balloons<00:00:50.539> in<00:00:50.719> there<00:00:50.869> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
we've got helium balloons in there and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.929 
we've got helium balloons in there and
we've<00:00:51.500> got<00:00:51.530> normal<00:00:51.920> blends<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.430> it's<00:00:52.879> a

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:52.939 
we've got normal blends of that it's a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:54.459 
we've got normal blends of that it's a
good<00:00:53.059> thing<00:00:53.119> for<00:00:53.269> comparing<00:00:53.839> alright<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:54.439> I

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
good thing for comparing alright so I

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.160 
good thing for comparing alright so I
reckon<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.850> when<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.210> break<00:00:59.539> I<00:00:59.839> think

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
reckon so when we break I think

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.079 
reckon so when we break I think
everything<00:01:00.890> in<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.100> band<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:01.640> gonna<00:01:01.879> have<00:01:02.059> to

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
everything in this band is gonna have to

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.479 
everything in this band is gonna have to
go<00:01:02.269> forwards<00:01:02.750> like<00:01:03.229> we<00:01:03.469> did<00:01:03.649> like<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.100> do<00:01:04.250> at

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
go forwards like we did like we do at

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.850 
go forwards like we did like we do at
because<00:01:05.059> that's<00:01:06.049> Newton's<00:01:06.350> law<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:06.799> that

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
because that's Newton's law and that

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.399 
because that's Newton's law and that
that's<00:01:07.039> a<00:01:07.250> stay<00:01:07.940> in<00:01:08.000> motion<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.899> continuing

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
that's a stay in motion and continuing

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.289 
that's a stay in motion and continuing
motion<00:01:09.710> there<00:01:09.799> unless<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.130> course<00:01:10.159> accent<00:01:10.970> so

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
motion there unless of course accent so

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.669 
motion there unless of course accent so
some<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.690> these<00:01:11.750> guys<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.140> happen<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.500> be

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
some of these guys have happen to be

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.880 
some of these guys have happen to be
either<00:01:13.459> blue<00:01:13.940> helium<00:01:14.390> or<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.690> red<00:01:15.259> air-filled

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
either blue helium or the red air-filled

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.410 
either blue helium or the red air-filled
blues<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:16.250> we<00:01:16.340> break<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.880> only<00:01:17.000> difference

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
blues that we break the only difference

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.330 
blues that we break the only difference
between<00:01:17.539> them<00:01:17.899> is<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.440> these<00:01:18.649> ones<00:01:18.950> are

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
between them is that these ones are

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.219 
between them is that these ones are
pointing<00:01:19.759> ahead<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.149> those<00:01:20.360> red<00:01:20.659> air<00:01:20.990> ones

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
pointing ahead and those red air ones

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.260 
pointing ahead and those red air ones
aren't

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.520 

that<00:01:30.270> couldn't<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:31.110> obvious

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that couldn't be more obvious

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
that couldn't be more obvious
I<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.680> bullets<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> blue<00:01:32.250> ones<00:01:32.520> they're<00:01:33.299> filled

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I was bullets a blue ones they're filled

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.430 
I was bullets a blue ones they're filled
with<00:01:33.750> helium<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.580> went<00:01:35.899> backwards<00:01:36.899> and

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
with helium yeah they went backwards and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.170 
with helium yeah they went backwards and
those<00:01:37.770> red<00:01:38.009> air<00:01:38.399> filled<00:01:38.670> ones<00:01:38.850> definitely

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
those red air filled ones definitely

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
those red air filled ones definitely
came<00:01:40.020> forward<00:01:40.409> exactly<00:01:40.770> laughs<00:01:41.070> something

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
came forward exactly laughs something

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
came forward exactly laughs something
different<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.759> happening<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.869> fills

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
different is happening because the fills

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.219 
different is happening because the fills
with<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> different<00:01:44.159> gas<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.330> reckon<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with a different gas what I reckon is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
with a different gas what I reckon is
that<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.070> stop<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> round<00:01:47.820> every

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that when we stop this round every

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
that when we stop this round every
single<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.440> one<00:01:49.619> wants<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> keep

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
single thing in this one wants to keep

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
single thing in this one wants to keep
going<00:01:50.940> sorry<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.380> install

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
going sorry I'm going for install

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.529 
going sorry I'm going for install
something<00:01:53.340> makes<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> stop<00:01:54.000> quarter<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
something makes it stop quarter to

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.600 
something makes it stop quarter to
Newton<00:01:54.869> everything<00:01:55.530> continues<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.310> its<00:01:56.460> line

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
Newton everything continues in its line

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.460 
Newton everything continues in its line
of<00:01:56.729> motion<00:01:56.880> until<00:01:57.240> something<00:01:57.659> triad<00:01:58.110> that's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
of motion until something triad that's

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.430 
of motion until something triad that's
the<00:01:58.920> first<00:01:59.190> law<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.090> everything<00:02:01.020> wants<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
the first law so everything wants to

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.620 
the first law so everything wants to
continue<00:02:01.830> going<00:02:02.280> forwards<00:02:02.700> until<00:02:03.210> something

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
continue going forwards until something

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
continue going forwards until something
stops<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.289> forwards<00:02:04.920> yeah<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
stops it going forwards yeah so that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
stops it going forwards yeah so that
means<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> actual<00:02:07.140> air<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:07.950> wants

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
means all the actual air in here wants

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
means all the actual air in here wants
to<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.880> forward<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.660> soul<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> windscreen

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to go forward and soul that windscreen

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
to go forward and soul that windscreen
it<00:02:10.830> stops<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.310> forwards<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> keeps

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it stops it going forwards so it keeps

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.509 
it stops it going forwards so it keeps
going<00:02:12.720> hits<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> wintry<00:02:13.380> piles<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
going hits the wintry piles up on the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.890 
going hits the wintry piles up on the
windscreen<00:02:14.790> yeah<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.569> end<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.810> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
windscreen yeah so you end up with a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
windscreen yeah so you end up with a
higher<00:02:16.170> pressure<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.769> this<00:02:16.920> end<00:02:17.220> than<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> do

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
higher pressure at this end than you do

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.479 
higher pressure at this end than you do
at<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.299> end<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.019> so<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.890> little<00:02:20.130> fellow

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
at that end and so this little fellow

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.300 
at that end and so this little fellow
these<00:02:20.730> helium<00:02:21.090> balloons<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:22.049> feel<00:02:22.470> more<00:02:22.980> air

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
these helium balloons they feel more air

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.250 
these helium balloons they feel more air
pressure<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> front<00:02:24.269> than<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:24.959> at

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
pressure on the front than they do at

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.470 
pressure on the front than they do at
the<00:02:25.350> back<00:02:25.620> no<00:02:26.190> choice<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> go<00:02:27.000> backwards

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
the back no choice but to go backwards

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.140 
the back no choice but to go backwards
which<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.190> red<00:02:29.340> ones<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.670> different<00:02:30.030> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
which on the red ones is different this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
which on the red ones is different this
one's<00:02:30.360> filled<00:02:30.600> with<00:02:30.720> air<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.380> there's<00:02:31.680> still

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
one's filled with air but there's still

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080 
one's filled with air but there's still
higher<00:02:32.220> pressure<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.670> front<00:02:32.820> than<00:02:32.970> there

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
higher pressure on the front than there

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.550 
higher pressure on the front than there
is<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.329> back<00:02:33.510> hold<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> math<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.410> all

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
is at the back hold the math is all

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
is at the back hold the math is all
becoming<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.250> yeah<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> mass<00:02:35.910> is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
becoming that yeah the mass is

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.280 
becoming that yeah the mass is
overcoming<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
overcoming up because it's like a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.259 
overcoming up because it's like a
heavier<00:02:37.769> balloon<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.090> these

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
heavier balloon and these are like these

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.699 
heavier balloon and these are like these
the<00:02:39.450> lighter<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.959> put<00:02:40.140> those<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.440> scales

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the lighter for you put those on scales

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.900 
the lighter for you put those on scales
they<00:02:41.010> wouldn't<00:02:41.280> weigh<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.489> much<00:02:41.519> as<00:02:41.670> those

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
they wouldn't weigh as much as those

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
they wouldn't weigh as much as those
Lobster<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.660> floating<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
Lobster I think floating is the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
Lobster I think floating is the
significant<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.030> fact<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.450> because

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
significant thing the fact is because

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.090 
significant thing the fact is because
that's<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.109> only<00:02:46.200> thing<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.859> those

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's the only thing is like those

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.550 
that's the only thing is like those
floating<00:02:47.670> at<00:02:47.850> those<00:02:48.090> don't<00:02:48.390> close<00:02:48.570> now

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
floating at those don't close now

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
floating at those don't close now
lotin<00:02:49.920> app<00:02:50.069> yeah<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.849> things<00:02:50.970> that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
lotin app yeah so all the things that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.760 
lotin app yeah so all the things that
don't<00:02:51.360> float<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.020> keep<00:02:52.290> going<00:02:52.500> forward

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
don't float in here keep going forward

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.589 
don't float in here keep going forward
so<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> things<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:54.090> floating

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
so and all the things that do floating

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.300 
so and all the things that do floating
head<00:02:54.780> keep<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.290> backwards<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.069> like<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
head keep going backwards it's like a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.839 
head keep going backwards it's like a
battle<00:02:56.910> between<00:02:57.090> buoyancy<00:02:58.020> yeah<00:02:58.349> and

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
battle between buoyancy yeah and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.850 
battle between buoyancy yeah and
acceleration<00:03:00.080> do<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.200> know<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.500> Isaac

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
acceleration do you know that Isaac

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.500 
acceleration do you know that Isaac
Newton<00:03:02.069> invented<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.790> catwalk<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.330> did

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
Newton invented the catwalk I did

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.510 
Newton invented the catwalk I did
actually<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.020> also<00:03:04.650> think<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.069> his<00:03:05.190> greatest

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
actually I also think it's his greatest

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.360 
actually I also think it's his greatest
work<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:06.930> give<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> stuff<00:03:07.380> about<00:03:07.860> gravity

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
work I don't give a stuff about gravity

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.070 
work I don't give a stuff about gravity
and<00:03:08.489> optics<00:03:08.849> most<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.269> time<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:09.930> my

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
and optics most of the time but if my

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.170 
and optics most of the time but if my
cup<00:03:10.410> who's<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> lemon<00:03:11.250> group<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.880> really

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
cup who's in the lemon group and really

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.520 
cup who's in the lemon group and really
annoyed<00:03:12.360> his<00:03:13.170> wife<00:03:13.349> was<00:03:13.530> happy<00:03:14.930> yes<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.260> very

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
annoyed his wife was happy yes a very

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.449 
annoyed his wife was happy yes a very
funny<00:03:16.890> boys

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
funny boys

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.339 
funny boys
except<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.090> course<00:03:18.120> Newton<00:03:18.810> never<00:03:19.050> actually

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
except of course Newton never actually

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.280 
except of course Newton never actually
married<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.640> he<00:03:20.730> had<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:21.900> woman

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
married and if he had the little woman

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.660 
married and if he had the little woman
at<00:03:22.380> home<00:03:22.590> would<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:22.950> told<00:03:23.220> her<00:03:23.430> genius

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
at home would have told her genius

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.280 
at home would have told her genius
husband<00:03:24.299> he<00:03:24.660> didn't<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.140> make<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
husband he didn't have to make a
