 today I am preparing a dish 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.590
 easy 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:45.010
 it is a roast of chicken legs 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.950
 boned rolled in pancetta e 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.050
 then put into a cooking sauce made 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:57.870
 with garlic that the sage oil 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.090
 rosemary and small pieces of bacon 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.089
 soon I will add the wine will cook for 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.970
 about 30 minutes and then we'll see the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.100
 final results 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 easy to prepare 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 here I add a little wine 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.970
 here now lower the flame or pro e 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 cook for 20 minutes 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.180
 the last ten minutes instead of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.710
 cruise without cover to spin the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.650
 single as a side dish of potatoes al 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.330
 rosemary and sage 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.330
 and here is the final result 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.090
 here are those two rolls 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.740
 practically made with the crosses of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:00.680

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.610

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.610

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:21.020

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.600
