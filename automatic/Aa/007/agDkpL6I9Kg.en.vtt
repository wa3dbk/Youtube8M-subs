your hub so this is what we're going
your<00:01:31.409> servers<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> connect<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
your servers are going to connect to the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.280 
your servers are going to connect to the
connect<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.060> they're<00:01:33.810> connecting<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
connect and then they're connecting to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
connect and then they're connecting to
send<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> information<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.189> proxy<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.509> this

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
send to the information to proxy so this

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.130 
send to the information to proxy so this
is<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:38.060> what<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.750> uh<00:01:41.630> once<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.899> have

harder<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.719> safe<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.200> no<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.409> gets

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
harder just to be safe so no one gets

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
harder just to be safe so no one gets
into<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.890> network<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
into your network and then you want to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.219 
into your network and then you want to
copy<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.590> uh<00:02:02.329> just<00:02:03.329> keep

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
copy this and then just uh just keep

go<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> edit<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:31.080> me<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:32.130> is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
go to edit so this got me this is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.760 
go to edit so this got me this is
actually<00:02:32.520> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.820> similar<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:34.350> other

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
actually kind of similar to the other

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually kind of similar to the other
thing<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.940> where<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> was<00:02:36.270> having<00:02:36.510> my

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
thing so this is where I was having my

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.070 
thing so this is where I was having my
problem<00:02:37.080> before<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> credential<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.900> is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
problem before so the credential this is

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.050 
problem before so the credential this is
the<00:02:40.260> credentials<00:02:40.830> are<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> credentials<00:02:41.520> for

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the credentials are the credentials for

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
the credentials are the credentials for
the<00:02:42.120> kinect<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.170> want<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> put<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> same

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the kinect so you want to put the same

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.820 
the kinect so you want to put the same
thing<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.500> need<00:02:46.680> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
thing in for here so then you need to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.560 
thing in for here so then you need to
worry<00:02:47.040> about<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.280> unless<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.850> know<00:02:48.300> what<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
worry about this unless you know what it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.270 
worry about this unless you know what it
is<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:48.990> need<00:02:49.230> use<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> server<00:02:50.130> as

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
is and you need use it for the server as

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.950 
is and you need use it for the server as
you<00:02:50.370> want<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.480> ever<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> want

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
you want to this is this ever you want

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.360 
you want to this is this ever you want
everyone<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> go<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.470> which<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.160> probably

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
everyone to go to which is probably

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130 
everyone to go to which is probably
gonna<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.640> your<00:02:53.820> hub<00:02:54.000> server<00:02:54.270> soak<00:02:54.510> up<00:02:54.870> their

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
gonna be your hub server soak up their

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.410 
gonna be your hub server soak up their
domain<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.520> then<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
domain if you know what to do then the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.650 
domain if you know what to do then the
server<00:02:57.600> G<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.080> list<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.410> servers<00:02:59.330> like<00:03:00.330> what

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
server G to list your servers like what

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.140 
server G to list your servers like what
they<00:03:00.750> already<00:03:00.980> EG<00:03:01.980> XP<00:03:02.610> thing<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
they already EG XP thing you have to

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.750 
they already EG XP thing you have to
make<00:03:03.330> sure<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.540> put<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.750> same<00:03:04.080> thing<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
make sure you put the same thing as that

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.820 
make sure you put the same thing as that
so<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.120> had<00:03:06.270> hub<00:03:06.510> survival<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.440> HD<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.590> I'm

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
so I had hub survival in HD so this I'm

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.180 
so I had hub survival in HD so this I'm
i<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.150> or<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.420> each<00:03:12.660> servers<00:03:13.380> motd

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
i think this or like each servers motd

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.560 
i think this or like each servers motd
so<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.550> don't<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:14.940> need<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.300> worry<00:03:15.330> about

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
so you don't really need to worry about

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.330 
so you don't really need to worry about
that<00:03:15.660> because<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.050> don't<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:17.190> going

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
that because I don't think you're going

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.550 
that because I don't think you're going
to<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.520> connecting<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.360> each<00:03:18.390> personal<00:03:19.290> server

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
to be connecting to each personal server

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.870 
to be connecting to each personal server
you're<00:03:19.800> going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.040> connecting<00:03:20.340> from<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you're going to be connecting from the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.650 
you're going to be connecting from the
like<00:03:21.270> hub<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:22.470> then<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.330> what<00:03:24.510> these

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
like hub so then if you know what these

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.470 
like hub so then if you know what these
mean<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.250> change<00:03:26.550> them<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.030> make<00:03:27.270> more

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
mean you can change them to make more

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.430 
mean you can change them to make more
sense<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.260> or<00:03:28.620> whatever<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.610> Elmo<00:03:29.880> TD<00:03:30.440> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
sense for you or whatever so Elmo TD you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.810 
sense for you or whatever so Elmo TD you
could<00:03:31.590> do<00:03:31.650> whatever<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> want<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.340> max

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
could do whatever you want and max

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.280 
could do whatever you want and max
players<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.300> can<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.480> as<00:03:33.570> many<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:34.050> your

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
players you can do as many is your

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.290 
players you can do as many is your
servers<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.739> hold<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.820> want<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.090> sure<00:03:36.270> to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
servers can hold so you want to sure to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.350 
servers can hold so you want to sure to
keep<00:03:36.630> authenticate<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.739> we'll<00:03:37.920> explain<00:03:38.820> why

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
keep authenticate so we'll explain why

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.920 
keep authenticate so we'll explain why
are<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.750> problem<00:03:40.290> was<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> was<00:03:42.630> doing

before this said hub one and the set up

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.660 
before this said hub one and the set up
to<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> did<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.560> hug<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.190> survival

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
to so I did this to hug this to survival

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.300 
to so I did this to hug this to survival
and<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.820> click<00:03:54.000> enter<00:03:54.390> command<00:03:54.989> V<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:56.070> see

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
and I click enter command V and you see

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.690 
and I click enter command V and you see
how<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:58.980> text<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.430> read

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
how it like this that this text is read

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.690 
how it like this that this text is read
you<00:04:00.600> know<00:04:00.690> yo<00:04:00.870> text<00:04:01.200> read<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.890> we<00:04:02.010> need<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.280> fix

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
you know yo text read so we need to fix

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.540 
you know yo text read so we need to fix
this<00:04:02.910> because<00:04:03.209> once<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.050> start<00:04:04.290> up<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.680> proxy

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
this because once you start up the proxy

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.220 
this because once you start up the proxy
it's<00:04:05.700> going<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.880> reset<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.870> what<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.050> need<00:04:07.140> to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it's going to reset so what you need to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.970 
it's going to reset so what you need to
do<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.070> then<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.470> tab<00:04:10.470> no

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
do is go here and then just the tab no

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.640 
do is go here and then just the tab no
need<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.880> space<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.450> till<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.170> gets<00:04:13.350> back<00:04:13.620> to

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
need to space it till it gets back to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.890 
need to space it till it gets back to
its<00:04:13.950> position<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.640> then<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.300> should<00:04:15.570> line<00:04:15.870> up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
its position and then it should line up

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.229 
its position and then it should line up
in<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.709> bar<00:04:17.130> sugar<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.850> where<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> was

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
right all the service again so we had

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.080 
right all the service again so we had
survival<00:04:59.650> if<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.520> want<00:05:00.699> to<00:05:00.760> put<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.060> the

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
username and the usernames you should

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.279 
username and the usernames you should
keep<00:05:03.639> like<00:05:03.970> what<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.449> actual<00:05:04.720> server<00:05:05.020> is

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
keep like what the actual server is

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.379 
keep like what the actual server is
because<00:05:06.100> this<00:05:06.310> is<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.580> commands<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.180> bring

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
because this is the commands you bring

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.180 
because this is the commands you bring
up<00:05:07.479> here<00:05:07.600> they're<00:05:07.810> going<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.990> do<00:05:08.050> /<00:05:08.260> server<00:05:08.800> and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
up here they're going to do / server and

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.830 
up here they're going to do / server and
then<00:05:09.729> they're<00:05:09.880> going<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.240> write<00:05:10.419> in<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.660> name

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
then they're going to write in the name

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.240 
then they're going to write in the name
so<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:12.070> then<00:05:12.160> hg<00:05:12.580> um<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:14.350> then<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:15.010> going

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
so and then hg um and then this is going

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.980 
so and then hg um and then this is going
to<00:05:15.580> be<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:17.820> like<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.030> color<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.720> server

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
to be the like the color of the server

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.800 
to be the like the color of the server
like<00:05:20.430> when<00:05:21.430> they<00:05:21.550> do<00:05:21.699> /<00:05:22.030> server<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:22.570> see<00:05:22.720> what

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
like when they do / server to see what

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.870 
like when they do / server to see what
the<00:05:22.900> servers<00:05:23.169> are<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.280> color<00:05:24.460> server

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
the servers are this is the color server

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.390 
the servers are this is the color server
and<00:05:25.180> then<00:05:25.660> service<00:05:26.410> currently<00:05:26.620> offline<00:05:26.889> try

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
and then service currently offline try

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.070 
and then service currently offline try
again<00:05:27.580> later<00:05:27.699> you<00:05:27.910> can<00:05:28.030> edit<00:05:28.210> these<00:05:28.509> messages

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
again later you can edit these messages

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.760 
again later you can edit these messages
with<00:05:29.259> the<00:05:29.349> colors<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.460> they<00:05:30.970> use<00:05:33.479> parentheses

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
with the colors so they use parentheses

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.740 
with the colors so they use parentheses
Colin's<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:36.099> think<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.490> don't<00:05:36.880> know<00:05:36.940> they<00:05:37.539> use

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
Colin's I think I don't know they use
