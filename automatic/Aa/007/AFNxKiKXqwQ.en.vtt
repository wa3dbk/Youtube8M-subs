00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
could also argue that it's way more

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.310

according to Honey I Shrunk the Kids
some<00:01:13.890> ants<00:01:14.070> could<00:01:14.250> live<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
some ants could live more than like a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
some ants could live more than like a
hundred<00:01:15.420> times<00:01:15.540> their<00:01:15.810> body<00:01:15.840> weight<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.439> here

hundred times their body weight and here

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
hundred times their body weight and here
I'm<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.280> surprised<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> lift<00:01:18.090> even

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I'm not surprised they can lift even

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
I'm not surprised they can lift even
more<00:01:18.540> than<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.930> since<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.380> obviously<00:01:19.590> lift

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
more than that since they obviously lift

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
more than that since they obviously lift

weights with their free time over there
it's<00:01:21.900> clear<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.560> any<00:01:22.740> weight

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it's clear they don't do any weight

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
it's clear they don't do any weight
training<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.820> mess<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.150> cardio
