00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the quality girls I bring you 4 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.720
 versatile and fast hairstyles to make 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 that they serve us to take to the office 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.389
 to the university to the school and for me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.389
 the most occasions 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.910
 no no 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.710
 for the number 1 hairstyle we're going to have 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.110
 that divide our hair into three 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.000
 portions from top to bottom and each 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.279
 of them we are going to hold it with a 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.880
 gomita like a ponytail 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.880
 little 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.130
 up to this point we already have a first 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 hairstyle that is a horse school 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.320
 super long and what we have to do 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.540
 It is open to the upper tail tape 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.250
 the others and in this way action of a 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.560
 super long horse rope without 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 However, we are going to progress by opening a 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.180
 little hole with our fingers in front of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.700
 each half and making a turn of the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.830
 hair and on this as you can see is 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.870
 very simple however what we 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.180
 leftover hair in the upper portion 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 we will also introduce the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 hole of the next portion to part 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.070
 to also rotate the hair of it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.659
 portion 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.610
 I think in the video it shows what 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.530
 I'm simply doing ahead of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.200
 Each rubber band in the part hold 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.450
 We opened a little hair and we passed with 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.210
 a turn what would be the tail between 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.070
 horse and what about that also what 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.729
 we are going to introduce in the hole of the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.340
 next portion that is let's do 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.320
 at the end 3 holes and 3 turns of 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
 our hair and then we will 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.190
 remain a low queue but with three 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.920
 lots of hair if they look like 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.020
 rotated and give it a shape as it should 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.020
 to be super sophisticated how nice 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.440
 for the next hairstyle we are going to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.299
 divide our hair as normally 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.580
 we make the line in my case and I the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.320
 I do a little bit and then we go to 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.790
 separate what would be the bangs the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.990
 pollina that we want to leave towards 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.990
 on both sides 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.180
 then on each side we will take a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 big lock and we're going to braid the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.380
 a thick braid that after we go to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.380
 talk a little bit to give it more volume 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.270
 you are in appointment we are going to hold 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.190
 momentarily with a league is now 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.720
 with a braid on each side we are going to take 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 one of the two and we're going to hold it 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.270
 behind our hair that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.840
 we want to do is kind of a media 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 tail but we will then remove the gummies 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.470
 of the end of the braid so that it 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.270
 mix a little better with our hair 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.020
 and we can cover it with another 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.760
 lock 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.010
 then we take the braid from the other side and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.959
 we pass it on or under the braid 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.600
 that we place and we also hold it with 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.310
 moby pings let's go the final gummy 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.950
 of that braid and we try to make it 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.600
 mix a little to our neck like 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.400
 we see we are trying to create the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.350
 illusion of a crown of braids that 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.770
 It has a bohemian style and looks super 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.770
 Super good 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.060
 no no 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.900
 for the next hairstyle we are going to take 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.580
 thick tufts on each side of the line 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.560
 divide that we made in the part 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.000
 top of our hair and we want 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.070
 that these locks are a little more 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.930
 thick because we need them long is 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.030
 say these have to get to the part 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.280
 from behind our hair now with the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.950
 remaining hair let's make a nice 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 chongo cebollita or as they tell you 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.630
 preference you can use a 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.250
 pretty can do it with lilita can 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.930
 turn it around and exploit it with boeing 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.300
 as you want me to simply 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 hold with a list and now we're going to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.680
 paste these locks very well 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.110
 we leave forward let's take one 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.100
 of them first and we will pass 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.470
 on that little onion or chongo or bonito and 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.930
 we are going to start to roll around 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.380
 this is to say we wanted to create a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.510
 kind of x with the two strands that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.459
 let's go forward let's hold everything 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.650
 with bobby pings trying not to 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.650
 come the hairs of the end but 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.770
 we do the same with the other's lock 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.070
 we passed it back and what 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.200
 we cross over the top of the bun and then 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.590
 we turn it around and the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.780
 we invite very well 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.430
 we block we determine what I think 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.230
 super versatile in fact I hope that what 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.120
 we could take for a party at night 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.330
 because it looks much more arranged and much 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.190
 more complicated than it is and it is very 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.190
 simple is very fast and do it 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.250
 the last hairstyle is simply going to 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.650
 require us to make a half tail to the 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.930
 height that we want from our hair and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.940
 then we are going to braid this with a 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.700
 normal braid which then also 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.680
 let's pull the sides to make it a 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.190
 little thicker and more disheveled because 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.190
 is what we want 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.460
 let's hold it at the end with a 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.350
 gomita and then we will do the same 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.690
 that in the first hairstyle simply 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.910
 open a hole in the upper portion 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.270
 of the braid and wind it around for 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.800
 give that touch a little bit more 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.540
 worked then we're going to take it for the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 very final and we are going to start 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.490
 roll it on its own axis and 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.310
 fix it on what would be the basis of the 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.990
 half tail with bobby pins and so it stays in 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.380
 a species like flower 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.230
 I do not know what to call that is simply a 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.200
 nice 3d rolled up and looks super more 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.790
 worker I leave here two links to 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.460
 two previous videos that I've done with 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.110
 hairstyles if you want to go see them and 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.330
 good is to say these noises I hope that 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.860
 they liked are very hairstyles 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.690
 easy to do and I think they can 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.220
 serve for many, many occasions 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.630
 I send a very big kiss you should not 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.710

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.710
