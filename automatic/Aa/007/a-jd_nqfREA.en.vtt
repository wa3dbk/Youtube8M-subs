00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
now if that sounds similar to the e63

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.939 
now if that sounds similar to the e63
that's<00:00:35.449> because<00:00:35.840> that's<00:00:36.199> what<00:00:36.379> this<00:00:36.530> car<00:00:36.800> is

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
that's because that's what this car is

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.070

but<00:00:37.699> it<00:00:37.790> is<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:38.030> little<00:00:38.300> bit<00:00:38.390> more<00:00:38.510> interesting

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
but it is a little bit more interesting

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.770 
but it is a little bit more interesting
because<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.590> its<00:00:39.739> four-door<00:00:40.519> coupe<00:00:40.880> styling

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780

whether<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:42.710> worth<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.130> cost<00:00:43.370> difference

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
whether it's worth the cost difference

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.729 
whether it's worth the cost difference
between<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:44.270> in<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.510> e63<00:00:44.989> is<00:00:45.290> what<00:00:45.620> we're

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
between this in the e63 is what we're

00:00:45.739 --> 00:01:02.600 
between this in the e63 is what we're
going<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:45.890> find<00:00:46.130> out<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:46.489> week

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
makes it very easy to point around now

the<00:03:01.050> power<00:03:01.440> yes<00:03:01.830> there<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.250> lots<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.150> lots<00:03:03.330> of

the time I may not be driving it the

the time I may not be driving it the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
best way this isn't a car I really enjoy

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.100 
best way this isn't a car I really enjoy
driving<00:03:32.459> ten<00:03:32.670> tenths<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.450> frank<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.020> a

chassis you start sensing that

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
understeer that hesitation throughout

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.400 
understeer that hesitation throughout
the<00:03:48.060> car<00:03:48.300> right<00:03:48.720> there<00:03:49.020> yep

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
the car right there yep

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.710 
the car right there yep
there's<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.709> understeer<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:51.510> not

there's some understeer and it's not

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.530 
there's some understeer and it's not
very<00:03:52.080> fun<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.160> back<00:03:53.970> off<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.270> little

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
very fun but if you back off a little

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.290 
very fun but if you back off a little
bit<00:03:54.780> we're<00:03:55.770> in<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.980> intermediate<00:03:56.640> damper

setting<00:03:57.660> there's<00:03:57.810> three<00:03:58.050> stages<00:03:58.320> or<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160

intermediate one that seems to be the

intermediate one that seems to be the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
best of both worlds the first stage is a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.160 
best of both worlds the first stage is a
little<00:04:03.360> bit<00:04:03.450> too<00:04:03.630> soft

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
little bit too soft

little bit too soft
the<00:04:04.320> third<00:04:04.530> stage<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> little<00:04:05.130> bit<00:04:05.220> too

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
the third stage is a little bit too

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.760 
the third stage is a little bit too
stiff<00:04:05.730> from<00:04:05.910> public<00:04:06.270> roads<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.380> second

stiff from public roads the second
station<00:04:07.920> seems<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> work<00:04:08.520> best<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:08.910> there's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
station seems to work best but there's

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.610 
station seems to work best but there's
still<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.300> little<00:04:09.480> bit<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.959> movement

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
still a little bit of that movement

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.060

what we've seen in the GTR and like the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.080 
what we've seen in the GTR and like the

necessary

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.760 

but<00:04:43.400> why<00:04:43.640> would<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.060> buy<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.270> over<00:04:44.840> an<00:04:45.260> e63

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
but why would you buy this over an e63

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.100 
but why would you buy this over an e63
that's<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.580> core<00:04:46.790> question<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.780> buy<00:04:48.050> this

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
that's the core question so you buy this

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.920 
that's the core question so you buy this
car<00:04:48.380> for<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.490> styling<00:04:50.090> cues<00:04:50.390> not<00:04:50.660> for<00:04:50.810> any

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
car for the styling cues not for any

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.510 
car for the styling cues not for any
added<00:04:51.200> functionality<00:04:51.830> because<00:04:51.980> if<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.310> sit

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
added functionality because if you sit

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.030 
added functionality because if you sit
in<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.670> rear<00:04:52.880> seat<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.540> seems<00:04:53.780> like<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.320> hood

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
in the rear seat it seems like the hood

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.990 
in the rear seat it seems like the hood
or<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.520> roof<00:04:55.780> cuts<00:04:56.780> in<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:57.020> little<00:04:57.230> further<00:04:58.000> but

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
or the roof cuts in a little further but

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.450 
or the roof cuts in a little further but
I<00:04:59.030> do<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.870> looks<00:05:00.140> of<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:00.440> car<00:05:00.890> versus

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
I do like the looks of this car versus

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.880
