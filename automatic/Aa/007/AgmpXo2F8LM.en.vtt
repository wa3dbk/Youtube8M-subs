there to just put one but I always put

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.160 
there to just put one but I always put
both<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.210> them<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> always<00:01:57.840> comes

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
both of them because it always comes

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
both of them because it always comes
with<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.490> holds<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
with two because it just holds up the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.980 
with two because it just holds up the
cards<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.509> easier<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.350> put<00:02:01.530> both<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
cards a lot easier if you put both and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
cards a lot easier if you put both and
so<00:02:03.990> here's<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> cards<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.189> come<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
really cool but anyway those are all of

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.420 
really cool but anyway those are all of
the<00:02:52.950> cards<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.379> this<00:02:55.379> was<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.859> spinner<00:02:56.159> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the cards and this was the spinner that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.539 
the cards and this was the spinner that
you<00:02:56.549> got<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:58.220> she's<00:02:59.220> kind<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you got in this one she's kind of the

gold top and you got the red bottom you

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.599 
gold top and you got the red bottom you
can<00:03:03.599> see<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.139> older<00:03:04.590> design<00:03:05.189> of<00:03:05.519> the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
can see this is the older design of the

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.539 
can see this is the older design of the
spinners<00:03:05.970> obviously<00:03:06.599> but<00:03:07.319> still<00:03:08.099> works<00:03:08.400> just

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
spinners obviously but still works just

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.720 
spinners obviously but still works just
the<00:03:08.760> same<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.590> that's<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.129> manual

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
the same and that's just a little manual

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.059 
the same and that's just a little manual
that<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:11.939> get<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.329> it<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:13.349> anyway<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.859> hope

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
