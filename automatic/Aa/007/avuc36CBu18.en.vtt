so therefore it's annoying and didn't
fit<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.090> well<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.140> paint's<00:01:25.439> kind

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
fit too well that's why the paint's kind

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.819 
fit too well that's why the paint's kind

it's<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.950> cool<00:05:17.190> design<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:18.000> they<00:05:18.960> really<00:05:19.290> tried

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
it's a cool design and they really tried

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.060 
it's a cool design and they really tried
the<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.450> fact<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.290> doesn't<00:05:22.919> hold

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
the the fact that it doesn't hold

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
really annoying I don't think it's worth

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.290

fifteen dollars I would probably pick up

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.110 
fifteen dollars I would probably pick up
the<00:05:30.990> high-octane<00:05:31.440> bumblebee<00:05:32.310> or<00:05:32.669> one<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:32.940> the

Dinobots<00:05:33.690> that's<00:05:34.580> just<00:05:35.580> my<00:05:35.790> honest<00:05:36.300> opinion

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
Dinobots that's just my honest opinion
