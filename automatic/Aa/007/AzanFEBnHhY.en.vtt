from<00:01:00.989> Andrews<00:01:01.500> life<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.890> aspiring<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> become

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
from Andrews life was aspiring to become

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
from Andrews life was aspiring to become
the<00:01:02.789> first<00:01:03.120> resident<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.840> awadhi<00:01:04.080> to

the first resident of on awadhi to

the first resident of on awadhi to
graduate<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.830> college<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
graduate from college so that's the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
graduate from college so that's the
first<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> easiest<00:01:06.689> level<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.229> complexity

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
first and easiest level of complexity

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
first and easiest level of complexity
that's<00:01:07.950> added<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.670> understanding<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's added to our understanding of

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
that's added to our understanding of
life<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.659> places<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.290> awadhi<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.830> all

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
life in places like on awadhi not all

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
life in places like on awadhi not all
poverty<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.909> equal<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.840> people

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
poverty is equal and not all people

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
poverty is equal and not all people
living<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.799> poverty<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.280> identical<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
living in poverty are identical but it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
living in poverty are identical but it
becomes<00:01:15.570> much<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.110> complex<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.799> think

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
becomes much more complex like we think

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.590 
becomes much more complex like we think
of<00:01:17.130> government<00:01:17.310> corruption<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> cause<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of government corruption as a cause of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
of government corruption as a cause of
poverty<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> often<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.700> from

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
poverty right and it often is but from

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
poverty right and it often is but from
Andrews<00:01:21.210> mother<00:01:21.509> Asha<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.049> also<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.650> out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
Andrews mother Asha it's also a way out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
Andrews mother Asha it's also a way out
of<00:01:23.070> poverty<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> empowering<00:01:24.390> women

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
of poverty we think of empowering women
