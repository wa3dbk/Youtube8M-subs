continuity<00:04:29.259> thing<00:04:29.830> or<00:04:30.220> whatever<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:31.150> no<00:04:31.300> I

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
continuity thing or whatever so no I

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.390

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.100 
superheroes but I think the closest to
what<00:04:36.490> you're<00:04:36.669> getting<00:04:36.940> at<00:04:37.060> about<00:04:37.449> using<00:04:37.900> tools

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
what you're getting at about using tools

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.260 
what you're getting at about using tools
and<00:04:38.470> an<00:04:38.560> altar<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.069> things<00:04:39.280> like<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:40.210> I

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
and an altar and things like that that I

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.779 
and an altar and things like that that I
know<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.599> would<00:04:41.259> be<00:04:41.319> Harry<00:04:41.680> Dresden<00:04:42.009> those

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
know of would be Harry Dresden those

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.900 
know of would be Harry Dresden those
with<00:04:43.090> actual<00:04:44.039> superhuman<00:04:45.039> powers<00:04:45.430> wouldn't

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
with actual superhuman powers wouldn't

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.559 
with actual superhuman powers wouldn't
need<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.360> use<00:04:46.509> things<00:04:46.840> like<00:04:46.960> tools<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.889> other

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
need to use things like tools that other

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.930 
need to use things like tools that other
human<00:04:49.569> characters<00:04:50.199> would<00:04:50.470> need<00:04:50.740> or<00:04:51.009> part

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
human characters would need or part

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.700 
human characters would need or part
human<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.810> think<00:04:53.050> you'll<00:04:53.169> find<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.470> kind<00:04:53.650> of
