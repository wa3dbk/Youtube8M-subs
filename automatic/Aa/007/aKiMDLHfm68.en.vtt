00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.190
 no no 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.599
 hello all welcome one more day to the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.119
 channel I hope you are very well 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.460
 It was very, very, very hard to bring us 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.520
 one and one kitchen and one kitchen or one 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.739
 good kitchen recipe today is 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.989
 a super simple recipe super fast 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.239
 as easy as the word that I'm going to 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.220
 indicate aguardiente already with that I say 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.430
 everything so without delay we are going to 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.430
 start 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.150
 i 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.820
 first of all we are going to peel the garlic two or 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.500
 three depending on the taste of the force 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.920
 that we want to give to our sheet 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.560
 oil now so that it does not repeat we're going 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.520
 to remove that chili pepper or that little heart 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.520
 which has in the middle 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 Y 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.719
 we repeat this step with all our 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.719
 garlic 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.040
 then cut them into pieces 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.070
 so that it will not be much easier 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.270
 chop them and crush 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.270
 no no no 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.590
 we add now a good pinch of salt 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.080
 so that the garlic does not slip and soften 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 a little 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 crush well until you get a concoction 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 unctuous 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.140
 finished this part we are going to incorporate 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 our egg yolk so we're going to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.850
 separate the yolk from the white 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.170
 at the moment we are not going to pour the oil 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.990
 we're just going to mix the garlic and the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.580
 egg and from now on only what 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.580
 we will do in the same way 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.580
 yes 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.840
 when both have been incorporated well 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.739
 we are going to pour the chorrón oil 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.409
 cited jet cited and we will do it or about 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.989
 the mold wall or on our 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.129
 Work tool better another type 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.560
 printed 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.629
 one suitable for the year li but like me 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.879
 I wanted to give on this occasion well 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.240
 with the camera then use this but not 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.700
 It is adequate 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.310
 as you see, we need patience 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.250
 always turning on the same side and 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.290
 pouring the oil little by little and 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.470
 because doing it by hand and will be there 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 looking and looking for 5 minutes 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.980
 because of doing it in a blender 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.380
 electric 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.990
 the consistency would take another color a 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.030
 little whiter than that 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.020
 does not know the same with which here the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.210
 trick is to do it by hand 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.680
 as you see every time we add 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.810
 the oil stays a little bit more 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.360
 liquid but then it adheres well in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.660
 the mold walls our mix 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.750
 should buy one pint at a time 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.550
 creamy but a little compact that does not 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.860
 it looks too liquid 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.200
 but if you want more quantity you 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.780
 we are throwing more and more oil in my 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.630
 case or in my house for example we like 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.940
 more a mixture a little more dense a 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.940
 oil a little more concentrated 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.180
 we are ending with the latter 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.040
 laps and here you have the final result 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.800
 as you see stays we want like 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.690
 dense and if we try to pour water 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.790
 bucket oil there is no way 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.130
 well that's been everything we've seen 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.110
 How simple, how fast and above 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.880
 the ico parrot how rich is that yes that 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.190
 it's a nice and cheap good recipe is 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.890
 you will not tell me you have not seen the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.440
 texture how it has been phenomenal 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.390
 fantastic in a little kiss amiti are worth 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.430
 he wants it a lot and that very many 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.590
 thanks for the recipe because it is that he 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.990
 He has given me the tricks that I have gone 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.690
 saying in the video so don tomás and 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.820

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.830
 simple that you find useful and nothing else 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.610
 that we see you very soon in a new 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.890
 video I quoted huge for all chau 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.320
 He also took me a little bit longer 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.940
 normal I do not know if it takes me more than two 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.610
 weeks and that's what while also 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.320
 order from china so I really 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.820
 this page 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.550
 I do not recommend it, so if 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.310
 you want to try or find this brand 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.750
 In other site 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.380
 the price a little cheaper a 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.380
 little bit more expensive
