00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.680 
slow but because it does shoot this slow
it<00:02:53.950> makes<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.370> more<00:02:54.610> accurate<00:02:54.850> weapon<00:02:55.270> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
it makes it a more accurate weapon it

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
means that it's a really good weapon to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.780
