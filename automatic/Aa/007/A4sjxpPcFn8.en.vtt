everyday<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.910> here<00:00:43.150> we<00:00:43.180> go<00:00:43.480> take<00:00:44.020> your<00:00:44.410> weight

multiply<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.570> by<00:00:46.720> 10<00:00:47.260> if<00:00:47.590> you're<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.400> woman<00:00:48.820> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
multiply it by 10 if you're a woman and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.700 
multiply it by 10 if you're a woman and
by<00:00:50.320> 11<00:00:51.010> if<00:00:51.190> you're<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:51.400> man<00:00:51.700> so<00:00:52.690> for<00:00:53.170> example<00:00:53.260> if

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
by 11 if you're a man so for example if

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.710 
by 11 if you're a man so for example if
a<00:00:53.800> woman<00:00:54.160> was<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.340> hundred<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.820> sixty<00:00:55.210> pounds

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
a woman was a hundred and sixty pounds

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.740 
a woman was a hundred and sixty pounds
it<00:00:55.840> would<00:00:55.960> be<00:00:56.050> 1600<00:00:56.980> calories<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.730> for<00:00:58.450> men<00:00:58.630> it

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
it would be 1600 calories and for men it

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.480 
it would be 1600 calories and for men it
would<00:00:58.810> be<00:00:58.960> just<00:00:59.140> a<00:00:59.260> little<00:00:59.290> bit<00:00:59.530> more<00:00:59.860> so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
would be just a little bit more so

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.240 
would be just a little bit more so
weighing<00:01:00.850> yourself<00:01:01.030> weekly<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.530> good<00:01:02.980> way

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
weighing yourself weekly is a good way

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.850 
weighing yourself weekly is a good way
to<00:01:03.940> measure<00:01:04.269> yourself<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:05.290> keep<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.830> on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
to measure yourself and keep you on

track<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.720> that<00:01:08.020> we<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.470> number<00:01:09.690> we

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
track now that we have that number we

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.240 
track now that we have that number we
want<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.200> factor<00:01:11.470> in<00:01:11.920> your<00:01:12.720> activity<00:01:13.720> level

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
want to factor in your activity level

want to factor in your activity level
for<00:01:15.250> simplicity<00:01:16.090> today<00:01:16.840> we<00:01:17.560> are<00:01:17.680> going<00:01:17.890> to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
for simplicity today we are going to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.750 
for simplicity today we are going to
assume<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:19.390> everyone<00:01:20.110> here<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.760> somewhat

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
assume that everyone here is somewhat

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.080 
assume that everyone here is somewhat
active<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:23.110> what<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.800> means<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.850> walk

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
active and what that means is you walk

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.020 
active and what that means is you walk
around<00:01:25.540> during<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.990> day<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:27.159> might<00:01:27.400> garden

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
around during the day you might garden

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.330 
around during the day you might garden
you<00:01:28.570> might<00:01:28.750> take<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.080> leisurely<00:01:29.409> bike<00:01:29.950> ride<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
you might take a leisurely bike ride a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.660 
you might take a leisurely bike ride a
couple<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.880> times<00:01:31.120> a<00:01:31.299> week<00:01:32.040> step<00:01:33.040> two<00:01:33.370> is

couple of times a week step two is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.350 
couple of times a week step two is
multiply<00:01:34.540> your<00:01:34.780> calorie<00:01:35.350> amount<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.909> point

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
multiply your calorie amount by point

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.469 
multiply your calorie amount by point
three<00:01:38.049> four<00:01:38.979> somewhat<00:01:39.580> active<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.950> add<00:01:42.310> the

three four somewhat active now add the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.200 
three four somewhat active now add the
calories<00:01:43.479> from<00:01:43.659> step<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.940> your<00:01:45.940> number

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
calories from step one and your number

calories from step one and your number
from<00:01:46.600> step<00:01:46.960> 2<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.909> gives<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.770> total

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
from step 2 and this gives you the total
