00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.689
 yes now cheap from there and i mean for now means first money through 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 Incheon bit nervously FÃ¼rth's application 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.239
 the Thunder Creek and come under the hammer 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.599
 do not bring now 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.599
 and that does not fit here 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.620
 the iPhone 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.620
 go now a body in the lot 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 40 now what can you restart 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.550
 is very important because you still want to do it on your own 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150
 Danger very important to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.590
 started very friendly and the iPhone is looking for pay and pulls that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.520
 not all 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 and now this is a forum minute equal 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 and then I can just briefly own what I'm looking for a stand instead 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 after this check point 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.170
 110 size, there are two new symbols actually no purest 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.439
 the garden of the world and that's right 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.200
 Licuanan 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.690
 and if you open that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.510
 you can see that you can install them the hard rock or as 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.200
 the duo is that they are here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.840
 and certainly promises - except I'm still new to the virtual 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.850
 World is true 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 Among the goals I paid for alternative programs to the castor 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.259
 under to shop 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.040
 then you also see lack of water 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 So what is there 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.690
 below you can see that there are several categories 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.530
 SuS can manage to investigate 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.940
 Currently the database is being updated 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.900
 and here we are already 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.570
 Rheine buddy squint 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.890
 there can not even go to the products 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.960
 showing what the ear is all about 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.910
 not great now I take 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.080
 As I said, I'm not the expert myself 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.880
 but I think it already give some interesting things with which goes 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.009
 it can only play around 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.009
 for many worth the view is not going well 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:14.589
 9 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.600
 have in Neunkirchen 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.509
 OK 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.829
 Then soon you feel like it could also be the abyss podcast 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.829
 Sammer and Nienberge Zoran clock 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.159
