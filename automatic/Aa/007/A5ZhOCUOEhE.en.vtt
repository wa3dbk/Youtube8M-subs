00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
look like coffee beans and you put this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
look like coffee beans and you put this
you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.000> another<00:01:36.630> packet<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.500> put

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you know this is another packet you put

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
you know this is another packet you put
it<00:01:37.799> through<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.720> standalone<00:01:39.720> grinder<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it through a standalone grinder and in a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
it through a standalone grinder and in a
medium<00:01:42.329> setting<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:44.310> very

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
medium setting and it I was very

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
medium setting and it I was very
skeptical<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.479> got<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.960> if

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
skeptical when we first got it but if

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
skeptical when we first got it but if
this<00:01:46.170> stuff<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.590> works<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.180> are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this stuff really works and these are

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
this stuff really works and these are
harder<00:01:48.810> than<00:01:49.020> coffee<00:01:49.320> beans<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
harder than coffee beans so they do a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
harder than coffee beans so they do a
good<00:01:50.640> job<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.420> clearing<00:01:51.899> out<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
good job of like clearing out all the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
good job of like clearing out all the
oils<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> jazz

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
oils and all that jazz

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
oils and all that jazz
