 I want to replace it with a panel ips panel 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.809
 y In the case of 70s in 50s, there is more panel replacement than lap or ssd 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.410
 It's very easy. 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.670
 There is no editorial, and it costs about 130,000 won including the normal expansion and the air-fuel ratio . 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.699
 There being able to save about 50,000 won hasimyeo yourself iteunikka 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.109
 Please watch this video and try it yourself 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.800
 I have a lg duty ips panel nel p25w f4 spa support 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.909
 I used it. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.040
 The river was about 84,000 won, and it was searched in Naver and sold the cheapest 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.549
 You can purchase the product 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.850
 I will disassemble the notebook before replacing the panel. Unlike the last time 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:47.479
 It's a little over the top, but it's not much different. 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.390
 All you need is a Phillips-head screwdriver and a home-rolling unused 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:54.680
 Plastic card 1 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:58.699
 On the left side of the display on the left side, 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.930
 If you push it, you will hear a plastic sound. 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.200
 If you push too much force to separate the plastic connection can break 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.550
 Please have a moderate amount of power. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 If you have any kind of hood, you can put it at hand when you are 3 years old . 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.960
 You have not been on the bezel, and now the display on the laptop looks a bit complicated. 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.440
 I will. 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 First you have to untie both drivers at the bottom of the top. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.730
 I did not see the video, but in the case of me, 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.900
 I wore rubber gloves and unfastened the screwdriver. 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:33.040
 As with previous ssd replacement, wear rubber gloves and replace 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 It's much easier 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.590
 This eojjae Removing all four drivers lie down toward the display keyboard 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.670
 I can. 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.329
 Because the panel notebook has the fourth connection point , carefully raise it 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.329
 I recommend you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.410
 Then followed gave Boise is currently doeneundeyo Look out for the red rectangular area 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.380
 You can remove the sticker from the previous one in the direction of the arrow. 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.850
 If you remove it, you can check the connection. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.080
 When you remove the connection, the notebook body and the existing tn panel are completely separated 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.080
 You can see that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 Now you can use the tn panel used in yo 70 to lg ips panel 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.790
 Let me replace it. 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.480
 How will it replace that which until now opposed 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.560
 All you need to do is connect the notebook to your laptop. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.090
 That's it. 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 Just like a previous ssd, just plug in the panel and 30 pins 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.540
 It's possible 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.080
 If you have done so, you can re-attach the sticker. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 Now we must make sure that this is compatible with ips panel y 50 kinds 710 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.959
 Just push the panel up and press the power button. 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.980
 Available 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.250
 If I did not get a response, I got it wrong or it was incompatible. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.840
 Please check it well at the time of purchase because it is not fan 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.440
 As you can see now, these panels I bought are well compatible. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.720
 Now that you have confirmed that it is working properly, 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.650
 Just give me the driver. 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.120
 Then, before attaching the bezel again, attach the protective sheet with the panel 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.640
 Remove the bezel from the first time you remove it . 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.390
 Just press it properly. 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 If there is no joint space, you can press the part well and it will be connected. 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 We have completely replaced our panel and tested the panel itself 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 I'm going to try. 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.740
 Haetguyo test performed on the test that monitors the web site info 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.310
 You can check the information on the display together with various tests 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:34.000
 If you check the information comfortably, you will see about 16.7 million 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.270
 The club is comfortable and has a ratio of 16 to 9 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.560
 If you look at the top, you will see various test samples 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.460
 I'm ready. 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.360
 If you are a mansion , jump on various colors on the screen and check for defective pixels directly. 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.900
 I saw it. 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.310
 As a result, you can not find any bad pixels in expressing all colors. 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.540
 There was no, and the color reproduction rate was high and the viewing angle was also good 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.590
 In the case of toothpaste, the fan is coated with a matte coating. 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.040
 We could see that the angle of view was worse than that of the light panel 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.640
 Of course , it was a lot better than the team panel. 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.000
 Avenues of the Avenues 2 Ultrath Trailer 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.020
 I could not see the afterimages on the screen. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.799
 In other words, it showed a great appearance on the dynamic screen. 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.730
 The added test will be discussed during the gaming performance review. 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.380
 Today video is helpful if the little bit of love and the subscribe button at the bottom of San Diego
