00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.170

you<00:02:00.950> know<00:02:00.979> anything<00:02:01.400> outside<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.120> know

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.610 
you know anything outside of it you know
I'm<00:02:02.300> known<00:02:02.510> but<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:02.870> like<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.140> are<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.500> know

so I just think that when people take it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.430 
so I just think that when people take it
to<00:02:05.930> that<00:02:06.050> level<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.410> start<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:08.440> think

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
to that level and start you think

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.030 
to that level and start you think
they'll<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.679> trying<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.100> yell<00:02:11.030> man<00:02:11.240> see<00:02:12.040> what
