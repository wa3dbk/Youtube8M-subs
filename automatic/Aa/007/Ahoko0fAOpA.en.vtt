travels are just in the middle of
nowhere<00:00:36.149> next<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> nothing<00:00:37.370> there's<00:00:38.370> haters

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
nowhere next to nothing there's haters

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
nowhere next to nothing there's haters
folly<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.329> does<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.930> large<00:00:40.230> area<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
folly it does have a very large area as

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.360 
folly it does have a very large area as
well<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.460> bunch<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> anchormen<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
well as a bunch of anchormen but it

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
well as a bunch of anchormen but it
again<00:00:44.370> too<00:00:44.789> far<00:00:45.030> away<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> Magnus

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
again too far away now there is Magnus

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920 
again too far away now there is Magnus
lighthouse<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.329> far<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> run

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
lighthouse it's not that far of a run

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.470 
lighthouse it's not that far of a run
but<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.250> reason<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.210> here

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
but the reason I don't want to go here

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
but the reason I don't want to go here
is<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.039> take<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> quick<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:53.940> at

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is because if we take a quick look at

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.200 
is because if we take a quick look at
the<00:00:54.719> rusty<00:00:55.559> yards<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.760> guys<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.180> see

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the rusty yards you guys will see

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.410 
the rusty yards you guys will see
there's<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.230> two<00:00:58.910> guaranteed<00:00:59.910> spawns

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
there's actually two guaranteed spawns

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
there's actually two guaranteed spawns
that<00:01:01.289> will<00:01:01.440> always<00:01:02.070> pop<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.789> they're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that will always pop up and they're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.660 
that will always pop up and they're
pretty<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.559> right<00:01:04.559> next<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> fast

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
pretty much right next to the fast

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
pretty much right next to the fast
travel<00:01:05.939> station<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.369> just<00:01:08.369> walking<00:01:08.670> through

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
travel station and just walking through

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
travel station and just walking through
here<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:10.170> first<00:01:10.470> enemy<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.799> find<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
here and very first enemy I find is an

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.990 
here and very first enemy I find is an
increment<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.920> do<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> pretty<00:01:14.460> decent

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
increment so do you have a pretty decent

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.140 
increment so do you have a pretty decent
spawn<00:01:15.330> rate<00:01:15.570> inside<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.560> area<00:01:17.119> they<00:01:18.119> are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
spawn rate inside this area they are

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.950 
spawn rate inside this area they are
shared<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> other<00:01:19.710> pirates<00:01:20.250> but

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
shared with all the other pirates but

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
shared with all the other pirates but
with<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> guaranteed<00:01:22.560> spawned<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
with the guaranteed spawned that you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330 
with the guaranteed spawned that you
guys<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.950> really<00:01:25.950> won't<00:01:26.130> be

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
guys are about to see really won't be

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.560 
guys are about to see really won't be
that<00:01:26.850> hard<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.390> find<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.320> farm<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:29.040> guys

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
that hard to find and farm these guys

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
that hard to find and farm these guys
now<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.930> order<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.770> gate<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.340> open<00:01:32.420> for

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
now in order to get the gate to open for

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
now in order to get the gate to open for
the<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> guaranteed<00:01:34.710> spawns<00:01:35.100> you're<00:01:35.340> gonna

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the two guaranteed spawns you're gonna

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
the two guaranteed spawns you're gonna
have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> clear<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.720> guys

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
have to clear out all these little guys

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.280 
have to clear out all these little guys
here<00:01:37.729> there's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.820> pretty<00:01:39.060> high<00:01:39.360> chance<00:01:39.810> for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
here there's a pretty high chance for

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.789 
here there's a pretty high chance for
increment<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.400> spawn<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:43.049> area

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
increment to spawn in this little area

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.980 
increment to spawn in this little area
right<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.509> additional

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
right here I think I get an additional

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.289 
right here I think I get an additional
two<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.820> guys<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
two then you can see these guys are the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
two then you can see these guys are the
two<00:01:48.509> guaranteed<00:01:49.140> spots<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.740> always<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
two guaranteed spots are always going to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
two guaranteed spots are always going to
be<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.369> front<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:51.329> there's<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
be in front then there's two more in the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.249 
be in front then there's two more in the
back<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.909> not<00:01:53.909> entirely<00:01:54.360> sure<00:01:54.570> we're<00:01:55.140> going

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
back here not entirely sure we're going

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
back here not entirely sure we're going
to<00:01:55.320> count<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.250> labeled<00:01:56.670> as

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to count these are not labeled as
