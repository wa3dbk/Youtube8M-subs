period<00:01:48.600> last<00:01:48.810> week<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.799> most<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
period last week which for most of the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.929 
period last week which for most of the
journey<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.790> hasn't<00:01:51.329> had<00:01:51.509> any<00:01:51.950> effect<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.610> my

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
weight but i think that combined the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.149 
weight but i think that combined the
fact<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:57.630> did<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.259> fiber<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.920> three

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
fact that i did not take fiber for three

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.219
