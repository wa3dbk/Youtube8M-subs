totally<00:01:00.420> fine<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.289> no

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
totally fine just make sure there's no

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.690 
totally fine just make sure there's no
like<00:01:01.710> clumps<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.989> forget<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
like clumps and also do not forget to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
paint the rim of the lid now just repeat

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
paint the rim of the lid now just repeat
the<00:01:08.820> process<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.140> next<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.740> but

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the process for the next one but

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
the process for the next one but
basically<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.450> gradient

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
basically we're going for a gradient

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
basically we're going for a gradient
effect<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.340> ombre<00:01:14.670> effect<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.150> make

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
effect or like an ombre effect to make

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
effect or like an ombre effect to make
sure<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> compare<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> last<00:01:16.380> color<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.250> make

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sure you compare the last color and make

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.140 
sure you compare the last color and make
sure<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.000> color<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> tad<00:01:19.380> bit

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
sure that this color is just a tad bit

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.490 
sure that this color is just a tad bit
darker<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.450> too<00:01:21.659> much<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> difference<00:01:22.320> but

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
darker not too much of a difference but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.810 
darker not too much of a difference but
a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.710> bit<00:01:22.860> darker<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.460> last<00:01:23.580> one

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
a little bit darker than your last one

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480 
a little bit darker than your last one
and<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.509> ahead<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> apply<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.860> even

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and just go ahead and apply an even

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
and just go ahead and apply an even
layer<00:01:26.670> again<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:27.990> before<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.799> for

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
layer again like you did before and for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.800 
layer again like you did before and for
the<00:01:29.759> last<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.060> you're<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> take

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the last one you're just going to take

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
the last one you're just going to take
the<00:01:31.140> pink<00:01:31.530> color<00:01:31.770> straight<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the pink color straight out of the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
the pink color straight out of the
bottle<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.880> apply<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.540> even<00:01:33.810> layer<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> don't

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
bottle and apply an even layer you don't

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.289 
bottle and apply an even layer you don't
have<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> add<00:01:34.950> any<00:01:35.220> white<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> last<00:01:36.060> one

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have to add any white to the last one

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.359 
have to add any white to the last one
because<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.890> gradient

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
because we are going for that gradient

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
because we are going for that gradient
effect<00:01:39.140> once<00:01:40.140> you've<00:01:40.290> let<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> paint<00:01:40.740> dry
