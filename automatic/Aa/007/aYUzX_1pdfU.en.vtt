00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello friends come on it's recipe I'm going to do 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.100
 pork pozole 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.420
 is this recipe that I'm doing 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.420
 more or less like for four people 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.910
 when they have to make a hole then 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.730
 we are going to occupy pork horn that already 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.240
 we have it here 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.699
 we are going to sew we also have here 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.759
 these are pork legs also 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.180
 they are going to know those approximately durÃ¡n 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.060
 as 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.070
 two and a half hours out there that are 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.870
 soft and the only thing we're going to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.060
 take hold there is is pure salt will 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.650
 we give kick so that is all that 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.440
 we are going to occupy the we are going to know 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.500
 apart so that it does not change a bit 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.330
 the taste of this but when it is 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.670
 our pozole is saved from throwing him 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.670
 we are also going to meet chiles 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 these are california chiles and they are like 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 about 7 chilies 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.480
 I'm going to sew them, I'll reveal them 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.940
 worry grain that what we're going 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.430
 to throw out the last one to finish 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.010
 what we are going to do here is to liquefy in 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.490
 chile the chile california that already 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.649
 I have here with water and avalanches 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.420
 I'm going to take this bit more 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.420
 quarter of the onion 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.330
 I do not cook and with so much seasoning 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.910
 it is wrong 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.910
 this and I did not turn it a 18 little 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.960
 which are 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.960
 with your fingers 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 we are making progress 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.950
 and now I 'm going to throw 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.030
 we are going to leave it 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.190
 the other half hour to the half hour 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.460
 At this point our legs are already 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.460
 so soft 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.380
 when you try to feel it then you 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.220
 let's move on to our 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.220
 because we also 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.959
 they lasted approximately 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.060
 is 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.620
 I will pass to make it 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.620
 keep living a little bit more 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.380
 I tried it and it lacked salt also in 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.380
 this moment 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.720
 we are going to leave it loss about 15 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.519
 minutes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.709
 that serve all 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.500
 thereafter 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.820
 like me what I use 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.820
 it's almost ready I know the last 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 plus 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.400
 get it 4 which will be destined 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.780
 but this one I'm not going to leave I would say after 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.510
 two 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.009
 the 10 minutes or 15 minutes we are going to 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.240
 take the grain 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.910
 and that's it 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.980
 it does not turn off 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.980
 We will not leave it for 15 minutes 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.629
 although 15 minutes have already passed 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.629
 now it's the grain 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.229
 we buy a can 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.010
 only the grain 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.340
 I'm going to let you go a little bit more in 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.639
 this case like this one is pre-cooked 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.969
 it's almost ready then 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.430
 only for the flavor to arrive and that 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.520
 and so 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.229
 our well 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.639
 Now I'm just going to wait for a 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.639
 little and I'll shut 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.110
 So our pozole was left, what we 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.800
 we accompany with let's take a little 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.230
 chile we have 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.230
 our pepsi can not miss this 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.700
 and he already threw the lemon and you 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.380
 that they like there if you want 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.870
 add the onion the hand 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:24.940
 it is to your liking of you then 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.940
 I wish you liked my recipe 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.190
 in this way and I do my pozole that 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.190
 thank you
