you<00:00:23.439> can<00:00:23.590> see<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.830> rail<00:00:24.039> foot<00:00:24.340> stay<00:00:24.669> quite

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
you can see the rail foot stay quite

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.330 
you can see the rail foot stay quite
soft<00:00:25.410> until<00:00:26.410> we<00:00:26.500> get<00:00:26.650> back<00:00:26.829> to<00:00:27.009> the<00:00:27.130> midpoint

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.250 
soft until we get back to the midpoint
on<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.849> board<00:00:32.280> and<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.690> go<00:00:34.840> farther<00:00:35.050> and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
on the board and as we go farther and

on the board and as we go farther and
further<00:00:35.469> off<00:00:35.649> they<00:00:36.040> get<00:00:36.160> quite<00:00:36.460> hard<00:00:36.760> for<00:00:37.210> wide

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110

anybody<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.999> put<00:00:52.269> on<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.480> board<00:00:52.629> so<00:00:52.839> far<00:00:53.079> nobody

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
anybody I put on the board so far nobody

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.750 
anybody I put on the board so far nobody
seen<00:00:53.620> them<00:00:53.710> thinking<00:00:54.010> about<00:00:54.069> their<00:00:54.249> balance

so<00:00:54.969> if<00:00:55.030> you've<00:00:55.179> got<00:00:55.329> just<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.659> little<00:00:55.690> time<00:00:56.140> on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
so if you've got just a little time on

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.189 
so if you've got just a little time on
the<00:00:56.409> water<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.539> peppero<00:01:00.690> 215<00:01:01.690> pounds<00:01:02.109> or

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
the water for the peppero 215 pounds or

the water for the peppero 215 pounds or
lighter<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.609> would<00:01:03.819> be<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.969> great<00:01:04.150> board<00:01:04.360> to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
lighter this would be a great board to
