00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.210
 here you know one the farm of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.860
 sell more for the xbox 360 first thing 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.629
 what we have to do is locate the 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.240
 forward world and look for the most 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.769
 short of the whole island is worth this model 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
 that I am going to teach you is already done 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.840
 many had done it but 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.820
 unfortunately for the xbox 360 its 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.620
 tutorials are not going to serve you and then 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 All I did was adapt it 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.790
 series good you're in the shortest part 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 of the whole island which is usually 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.180
 It is always close to where the spa is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.099
 where when we're going to continue for the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.170
 dragon then we will have to do 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.510
 we have to locate the part more more 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 short of the map since the map is a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 cube a giant cube then for this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 we have to use slaps blocks 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.560
 transparent so you do not know 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.970
 understand more of really way we have 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.820
 that locate this and then at the end the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 maximum corner that would be the end point 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.790
 Square worth when we have reached 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 the final corner we have to do 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.170
 get to the lowest to the height pro 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.059
 lowest depth of everything 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 would be the map so we can start 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 do what is this farm worth 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.440
 we have to download everything all everything 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 everything everything without importing that's why I 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 I recommend that when you are doing 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.759
 this only carry the materials 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.719
 armor in nothing because they can die 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.850
 are doing this is one of the 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.140
 risks now when we have not done more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.090
 or less the base as we wanted to do 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 we have to file everything illuminate all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 this island is worth because in this version 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.179
 the sender man is exposed will do more here and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 we will do it and they will not let us do 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.929
 this farm is worth that is one of the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.110
 main risks of doing this great 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.490
 house if you do not light up well it's not going to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.210
 look good then, since we have 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 lit up that make our farm worth 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 the base is something that we have to learn 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.619
 to do, I recommend doing 3 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.619
 the width that is around here then 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.840
 would be 4 for 15 is worth this series 7 on 8 and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.569
 another 7 is worth then the ring that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.140
 surrounds this base that is 4 x 15 will have 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.759
 to be 3 and 3 is worth to give them 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 the blocks are worth then since already 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.479
 we have done this we have to put two 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.280
 blocks and a slam then we removed the two 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.659
 what I work and it would be like the entrance to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.789
 us to be able to access the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 brothers it would be more or less like that 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.399
 it's because they do not make rule stay 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.289
 inside and things like that 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.079
 good previously after having done 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.459
 this is not you looking to make a height of 43 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.900
 blocks to start doing what 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.520
 would be the second base where we would have 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.220
 the centers more than we're going to want 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.320
 that kill and have all the xp and the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.740
 interpreters is then worth what we have 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.290
 what to do would be to locate the tip of these 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.150
 bases up with the bass because in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
 the more governments create from above they go to 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.950
 fall down then fall down 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.800
 then we have to make a ring that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.330
 we will have to coat 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.740
 two tall blocks too so that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.170
 would be so that the 3 tall 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.020
 I had 4 by 15 like the one below 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.670
 then then already done this 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.950
 we will have to have buttons and lianas 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.540
 good iliana buttons are the ones that use and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.120
 elaborate I think you can do good 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.710
 racing I do not know the truth good but for 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.590
 that this would be practically for 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.450
 that others reduce the fall and not by 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.820
 if we do more bases up then 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.140
 would be to put buttons down so that the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.120
 lianas do not keep growing and we do not 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 ruin the farm vale and lianas up 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.410
 so that it stops at the speed of fall and 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.940
 start from zero is worth because the height 43 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.920
 is to leave them to a good touch 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.930
 after doing this we have to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.170
 put slaps 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.520
 it does not matter if you put stone or wood 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.959
 since the stones are for 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.490
 entities and the wooden ones are for 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.210
 entities objects so 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.280
 it does not matter the truth how you put them 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.530
 because getting sick ventilated is worth 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.800
 after doing this we have to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.200
 coat where we have this with a few 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.820
 rings is worth 2 x 2 because we are going to 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.410
 start putting what are the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.940
 it then subtract materials 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.510
 let's recover gather them we'll put 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.920
 around the slaps in these ways 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.450
 who are watching good screens here 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.690
 I put it accelerated then we will put 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.000
 pistons rears of those remains for 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.130
 that does not troll us is good so that 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.900
 they are too much they can fall by stepping 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 the lapse then we have to do a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.440
 third ring that's why I tell you that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.210
 make the bottom of three because if 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.890
 it will not reach the blocks 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.300
 well we have to cover everything but 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.580
 like some rings then we have to 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.750
 have this I recommend putting it next 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.310
 because if you are not going to combine it is not going to 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.720
 activate a piston and that floor can 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.910
 to arrive can reach is to put in arms and 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.260
 is not going to fall then why do I speak 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.390
 so fast when I do this it's worth it 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.570
 to fall and all this the effectiveness of 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.880
 this farm no matter what there is also 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.500
 that illuminated all the space and everything 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.760
 more good we have to put the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.440
 above the pistons and where the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.700
 remaining could be to put the centers 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.420
 above the obstacles is because it 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.960
 expand 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.850
 will not let us then the effectiveness 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.920
 of these from this farm with only one 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.710
 base would be 4 to 6 tend more by 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.040
 minute what is good in 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.920
 part because it's if we leave it on average 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.540
 now we have many not then I already 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.570
 I have a map on your rival to 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.840
 teach them what efficiency would be 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.820
 from one of more than one base worth good here 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.890
 we are in the turbo, I have two 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.290
 bases here I built them to see 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.570
 If this is legal, I have done it 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.760
 It's worth the same nothing more than the second 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.100
 you will not have to put it targets 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.910
 after real materials would be the base as well 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.730
 as they see it, we are going to put the base and 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.010
 so what is the effectiveness of two or 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.590
 more in your rival when you already have everything 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.900
 this is worth something that I do not understand is that 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.540
 it does not double if it arrives it can triple 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.560
 the base the speed of selling sell 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.620
 better so I'll be back when the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.160
 minute 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.160
 Water 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.259
 bajnai 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.510
 and well, we are waiting a lot and see 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000
 although there have been many too many in 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.800
 dramas just for being fk away from 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.770
 keyword 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.150
 and well this would be practically all the 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.340
 farm you see that it is very efficient and 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.020
 they keep falling they can not even stop 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.789
 even when you are arriving people 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.080
 is falling 1 this would be practically 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.520
 the whole farm I hope it is from 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.430
 served and they do it in their survival 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.530
 so that they have in January the infinite and 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.520
 experience for quick and juve will 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.520
 go song and see you later 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.889
 it was a subscription
