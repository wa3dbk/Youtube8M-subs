would<00:01:53.340> hit<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.790> you'll<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
would hit what you'll see is like it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
would hit what you'll see is like it
will<00:01:54.899> say<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.350> regular<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.070> white<00:01:56.310> flour

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
will say like regular like white flour

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179 
will say like regular like white flour
and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.630> they'll<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.200> whole<00:01:58.890> wheat<00:01:59.009> as

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and then they'll just use whole wheat as

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
and then they'll just use whole wheat as
a<00:01:59.219> filler<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> want

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
ingredient and holy is a second

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.249 
ingredient and holy is a second
ingredient<00:02:09.780> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
