00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
number one is to stick to the basics try

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
number one is to stick to the basics try
to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.410> many<00:00:55.590> whole<00:00:56.100> foods<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.699> possible

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to get as many whole foods as possible

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
because those kind of end up being more

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.289

number<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.119> prioritize<00:01:42.869> your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
number two which is to prioritize your

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
number two which is to prioritize your
vegetables<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:45.479> means<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
vegetables and that means that if you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.929 
vegetables and that means that if you
have<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.850> choice<00:01:48.119> between<00:01:48.439> leeks<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
have the choice between leeks and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
have the choice between leeks and
broccoli<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.360> spinach<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.079> example<00:01:52.619> then

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
broccoli or spinach for example then

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.090 
broccoli or spinach for example then
always<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> foods<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.500> higher

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
always go for the foods that are higher

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.389 
always go for the foods that are higher
in<00:01:56.399> nutrition<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> fact<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
in nutrition like I for a fact that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.569 
in nutrition like I for a fact that
broccoli<00:01:59.670> has<00:02:00.180> huge<00:02:00.990> amounts<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.560> calcium<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
broccoli has huge amounts of calcium in

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.929 
broccoli has huge amounts of calcium in
it<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.899> spinach<00:02:04.500> has<00:02:04.740> huge<00:02:05.070> amounts<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.640> iron

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it and spinach has huge amounts of iron

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.290 
it and spinach has huge amounts of iron
so<00:02:06.780> I'd<00:02:07.079> rather<00:02:07.290> go<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.550> kind<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.030> foods

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so I'd rather go for that kind of foods

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I'd rather go for that kind of foods
instead<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.470> leeks<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.280> cucumbers<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
instead of leeks that or cucumbers that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.130 
instead of leeks that or cucumbers that
are<00:02:12.540> pretty<00:02:12.780> much<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.080> water<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
are pretty much just water and you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.370 
are pretty much just water and you
don't<00:02:14.320> get<00:02:15.120> enough<00:02:16.120> nutrition<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.750> them<00:02:17.140> so

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
don't get enough nutrition for them so

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.750 
don't get enough nutrition for them so
for<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> same<00:02:17.830> amount<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.190> money<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:18.610> get

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
for the same amount of money you can get

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.650 
for the same amount of money you can get
more<00:02:18.970> nutrition<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:20.400> kind<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.520> more<00:02:22.060> super

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
more nutrition for kind of more super

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900 
more nutrition for kind of more super
fruity<00:02:22.930> vegetables<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:23.950> fruits<00:02:24.220> like

on<00:04:44.409> a<00:04:44.439> budget<00:04:44.650> here<00:04:44.909> my<00:04:45.909> tip<00:04:46.330> number<00:04:46.360> six<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:47.020> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
on a budget here my tip number six is to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.189 
on a budget here my tip number six is to
treat<00:04:47.620> yourself<00:04:48.039> with<00:04:48.490> exotic<00:04:49.419> fruits<00:04:49.810> and

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
treat yourself with exotic fruits and

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.809 
treat yourself with exotic fruits and
that's<00:04:51.039> what<00:04:51.159> I've<00:04:51.250> been<00:04:51.370> doing<00:04:51.580> for<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:51.759> while

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
that's what I've been doing for a while

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.240 
that's what I've been doing for a while
I've<00:04:52.150> been<00:04:52.180> getting<00:04:52.539> any<00:04:52.599> dates<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.500> mangoes

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
I've been getting any dates and mangoes

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.429 
I've been getting any dates and mangoes
and<00:04:54.849> sometimes<00:04:55.360> dried<00:04:55.629> fruit<00:04:55.900> because<00:04:56.409> I

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
and sometimes dried fruit because I

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.170 
and sometimes dried fruit because I
really<00:04:56.919> really<00:04:57.219> love<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.460> stuff<00:04:57.909> and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
really really love that stuff and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.390 
really really love that stuff and
instead<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:59.020> going<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.590> buying<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.919> chocolate

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
instead of going and buying a chocolate

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.879 
instead of going and buying a chocolate
and<00:05:00.699> because<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.750> can't<00:05:02.020> be<00:05:02.229> on<00:05:02.349> a<00:05:02.379> budget<00:05:02.620> all

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
and because you can't be on a budget all

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.170 
and because you can't be on a budget all
the<00:05:03.009> time<00:05:03.219> sometimes<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:03.759> have<00:05:03.909> to<00:05:04.029> give

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the time sometimes you have to give

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.420 
the time sometimes you have to give
yourself<00:05:04.539> a<00:05:04.659> treat<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.169> give<00:05:05.740> myself<00:05:05.889> the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
yourself a treat I give myself the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.369 
yourself a treat I give myself the
fruits<00:05:06.699> that<00:05:06.819> I<00:05:06.969> really<00:05:07.479> really<00:05:07.779> love<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.349> I

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
fruits that I really really love but I

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.290 
fruits that I really really love but I
can't<00:05:08.439> have<00:05:08.889> that<00:05:08.919> frequently<00:05:09.550> although<00:05:10.270> I

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
can't have that frequently although I

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.689 
can't have that frequently although I
try<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:10.599> have<00:05:10.810> dates<00:05:11.189> pretty<00:05:12.189> much<00:05:12.370> every<00:05:12.669> day

money but I don't know I think they're

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.499 
money but I don't know I think they're
worth<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.800> if<00:05:18.069> you<00:05:18.099> can't<00:05:18.610> be<00:05:18.819> on<00:05:18.969> a<00:05:19.000> budget<00:05:19.360> on

might sound a lot for some and it might

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.980 
might sound a lot for some and it might
sound<00:06:34.509> a<00:06:34.659> little<00:06:34.689> for<00:06:35.379> others<00:06:36.240> I<00:06:37.240> used<00:06:37.599> to<00:06:37.810> live

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
sound a little for others I used to live

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.970 
sound a little for others I used to live
on<00:06:38.169> tenure

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
on tenure

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.000 
on tenure
a<00:06:39.040> week<00:06:39.340> but<00:06:39.820> I<00:06:39.850> wasn't<00:06:40.300> eating<00:06:40.620> nothing<00:06:41.620> so<00:06:41.890> if

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
a week but I wasn't eating nothing so if

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.770 
a week but I wasn't eating nothing so if
you're<00:06:42.160> living<00:06:42.400> on<00:06:42.700> that<00:06:43.270> amount<00:06:43.570> of<00:06:43.660> money

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
you're living on that amount of money

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.570 
you're living on that amount of money
you're<00:06:43.990> probably<00:06:44.110> not<00:06:44.440> even<00:06:44.740> eating<00:06:44.920> enough<00:06:45.250> I

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
you're probably not even eating enough I

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.270 
you're probably not even eating enough I
think<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.480> healthy<00:06:47.110> budget<00:06:47.290> is<00:06:47.590> around<00:06:47.710> forty

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
think a healthy budget is around forty

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.940 
think a healthy budget is around forty
to<00:06:48.400> fifty<00:06:48.880> for<00:06:49.690> anyone<00:06:50.110> that<00:06:50.320> can't<00:06:50.620> afford

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
to fifty for anyone that can't afford

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.950 
to fifty for anyone that can't afford
