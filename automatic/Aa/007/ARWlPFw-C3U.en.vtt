00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
I did everything on my first try and so

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
I did everything on my first try and so
pretty<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.540> floss<00:01:15.780> left

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
pretty much to this little floss left

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
pretty much to this little floss left
flawlessly<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.189> guess<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:18.150> okay

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
flawlessly I guess but you know okay

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.020 
flawlessly I guess but you know okay
almost<00:01:19.350> flawlessly<00:01:20.479> waited<00:01:21.479> other<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
almost flawlessly waited other than that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
almost flawlessly waited other than that
so<00:01:24.030> anyway<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.689> horse<00:01:25.020> thing<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so anyway this horse thing can be a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
so anyway this horse thing can be a
little<00:01:25.950> tricky<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.790> need<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.229> like

possibly can and trying not to fall off
that<00:01:34.500> part<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.670> hard<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.600> you've
