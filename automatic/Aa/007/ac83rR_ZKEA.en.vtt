00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
to twist on my cap and make sure you get

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.800 
to twist on my cap and make sure you get
a<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.730> type<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> classic<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.569> can't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
a like this type of classic I can't

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.300 
a like this type of classic I can't
really<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.170> through<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.130> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.970 
really see through it and I like that
better<00:02:31.519> because<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.840> seems<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> me<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
better because it seems to me that that

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.900 
better because it seems to me that that
plastic<00:02:34.489> last<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.850> lot<00:02:34.970> longer<00:02:35.030> than<00:02:35.569> when<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.699 
used to buy the package of bottles and
you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.160> see<00:02:40.280> through<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.519> plastic<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709
