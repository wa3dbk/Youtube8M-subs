00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.290
Attending Open Day is the first step on your
path to university, so we’ve made this film

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.150
to help.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.480
When I was deciding what Open Days to attend
I considered the universities I was most likely

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.500
to apply to. I did lots of research and that
included looking at league tables and student

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.730
satisfaction surveys.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.750
I wanted to have a quite green campus. Although
Birmingham’s a big city it has so many trees

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.390
and that’s reflected here, so it was perfect
for me.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.310
It’s really important to plan your day so
you can fit in all your activities. The best

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.800
thing to start with is download the university’s
Open Day Programme, or their university app,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.730
and that will let you have a look at what
to expect at your Open Day. Once you’ve

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.100
chosen which universities you want to go to
you need to book and then make plans for your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.620
day. The best place to start with this is
the university’s own website.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.120
A big thing I’d recommend is making sure
they don’t clash with school or each other.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.190
A lot of universities offer Open Days on a
Saturday so you don’t necessarily have to

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.180
miss classes at school.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.890
The other thing that’s really important
is to find out how you’re going to get here.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.210
So look at what transport links the university
has, look at how you can get here by car,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.550
by train or by bus if you want. With Birmingham
we’re really lucky, we’ve got our own

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.220
train station on campus so for her, get yourself
a railcard, it’s the easiest way. You’ll

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.650
save loads of money and it’s the quickest
way onto campus.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.170
If you are having any particular questions
such as around disabilities or maybe finance,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.630
seek out the individual that’s an expert
on that – there will be one on every campus

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.430
– and ask the questions of them because
they’ll be able to give you tailored information

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.580
that you wouldn’t be able to find on your
average website.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.750
So there will be lots of course leaders around
on the day so really make the most of the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.580
opportunity to talk to them.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.549
And make lots of notes in the lectures that
you go to. This could be useful in preparing

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.909
your personal statement.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.320
Ask what your core modules will be, ask what
kind of input you get to pick and when you

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.490
get to pick certain modules. Check about things
like employability and how students are engaged

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.420
with by other departments and for me, Birmingham’s
employability was really good and I was really

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.360
impressed by that.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.030
You should find out about the employability
rates of the course, the pass rate, the assessment

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.229
methods that they use, so whether they asses
mainly on coursework or exams or perhaps placement

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.180
and also opportunities for you to study abroad
or do a year in placement if that’s what

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.009
you’re interested in.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.780
It’s not all about the course though, so
make sure when you’re on your Open Day you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.740
plan to see the accommodation, the students
union, things like that, because they will

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.250
make up the body of your university experience
and they are just as important as what course

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.950
you choose to do.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.560
If you are really passionate about a sport,
I’d highly recommend going and looking at

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.120
the gym and I’d really recommend going to
look around your student union; it’s where

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.660
you’ll grab a bite to eat, do a bit of work,
meet up with friends and it’s where usually

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.930
all the societies are based so it’s well
worth having a look around there and seeing

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.800
what they offer.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.209
When I was considering which Open Days to
attend, it was really important for me to

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.069
attend at least my top three universities.
You can’t replace that feel you get when

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.340
you actually go onto a campus and see what
it’s like.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.819
When you first come to the university it might
seem really big and daunting but not to worry,

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.870
there will be lots of student ambassadors
around to point you in the right direction

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.459
should you get lost. Alongside that the university
will put up loads of extra signs, just for

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.999
the Open Day, and for the students like you
that are coming to visit.
