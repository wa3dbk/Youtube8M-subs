00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.930
 as hydrate is one 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 thermoregulation body needs to regulate 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 internal temperature that you are in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 activity 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.659
 This is a sign that you are 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 dehydrated and is making a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.490
 activity up to a certain intensity 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.500
 but if you do not replenish this water during

 This process calls hydrolysis 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.240
 lipid only learned this body 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.460
 dehydrated does not lose weight every 20 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 minutes you every 20 15 20 minutes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.119
 you only consumed 200 ml of water is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.369
 very cool the fourth thing that people 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.899
 need to know about weight loss is just the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.720

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.900
 matter and you spend 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.209
 the more you consume is the tip is 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.280

 increasing your lean mass you increase 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.750
 the metabolism then you end up at medium 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.519
 losing weight more then the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.980
 ideal is that you do exercises 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.959
 aerobics with resistance exercises 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.810
 taxon to bodybuilding 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.640
 this roby duo resisted is a double 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.049

 to burn fat in the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.379
 How does belly work? 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.030
 abdominal issue make abdominal to 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.680

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.620
 When you make bishops to burn 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.989
 fat in the belly, it only strengthens the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.609
 musician involved in the exercise if you 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.930
 really want to lose visceral fat at 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.989
 belly fat you need to create 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.060
 a negative energy demand to spend 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.250
 more so spend more and more having 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.170
 regular workouts and a good gesture 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.329
 usually we use a diet here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.629
 that is not poor leaves nor carbohydrates 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.819
 or 1200 calories at least we are already 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.739
 600 calories for those who do not 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.959
 it works cool the sixth thing he 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.819
 need to know if weight loss is 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.370
 how much time but I train more people 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.530
 it's true, it 's a lie if you are 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 degrade your muscles and 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 weaken your body a lot it goes super 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.919
 offset this response will start 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.019
 store more fat as often as 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.720
 I entered the most fattening also us 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.340
 have to train and eat right 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.459
 how much more or less training time 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.220
 indicates the day then so at most so 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.780
 You train two hours a day an hour. 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.590
 and a half hours with all the routines 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.079
 OK 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.880
 and if you do a very intense workout the 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.959
 next workout has to be a workout without 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.970
 intensity 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.010
 You have to always work like this. 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.840
 in this compensation after a workout 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.760
 strong in weak training and so 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.739

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.510
 thing you wanted to know about diet diet 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.519
 without carbohydrate with much 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.099
 protein does not work then 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.739
 protein diet only works for two 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.959
 things are overloading your kidney and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.000
 eliminate body water because the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.919
 protein does not need water to make 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.879
 the break then if you ingest less 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.650
 carbohydrate 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.570
 the water that his body had stored 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.820
 to digest carbohydrates and 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.950
 ingeria will not be needed anymore 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.780
 send that water away but when you 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.030
 back to eating carbohydrate it will have 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.250
 store water again then diet 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.380
 only works for a 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.270
 shock you and eliminate it a little 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.660
