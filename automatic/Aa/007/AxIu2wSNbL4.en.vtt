did<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.140> him<00:00:37.350> at<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.450> left-back

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
did not like him at all so at left-back

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.319 
did not like him at all so at left-back
I<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> Adam<00:00:40.590> white<00:00:40.800> he's<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> fastest<00:00:42.090> left

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I have Adam white he's the fastest left

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
I have Adam white he's the fastest left
back<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> league<00:00:43.020> which<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> why<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> picked

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
back in the league which is why I picked

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.760 
back in the league which is why I picked
him<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.360> left<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.750> even<00:00:46.079> those<00:00:46.200> Bruns<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
him as my left back even those Bruns the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
him as my left back even those Bruns the
I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:47.910> fastest<00:00:48.329> silver<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I think the next fastest silver is like

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
I think the next fastest silver is like
78<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:49.920> something<00:00:50.309> don't<00:00:51.000> hold<00:00:51.180> me<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
78 or something don't hold me to that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.319 
78 or something don't hold me to that
though<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.860> believe<00:00:52.920> he<00:00:53.399> was<00:00:53.579> already<00:00:54.090> in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
good pace for a right-back silver 174
dribbling<00:01:45.090> which<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> nice<00:01:45.570> means<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.960> can

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
dribbling which is nice means you can

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
dribbling which is nice means you can
hold<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> ball<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.220> 70<00:01:47.850> defending

which<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.540> saying<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.960> always<00:01:49.170> see

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
which you're saying you don't always see

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.300 
which you're saying you don't always see
from<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.040> fullback<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.180> silver<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.920> played

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
from a fullback that silver so I played

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.760 
from a fullback that silver so I played
it<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> 4-2<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> formation<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.290> don't

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it in a 4-2 to formation because I don't

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.410 
it in a 4-2 to formation because I don't
think<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.579> many<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.119> wide

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
think there is that many good wide

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.060 
think there is that many good wide
players<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:58.140> some<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.409> Pacey<00:01:58.740> ones

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
players there's some really Pacey ones

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.459 
players there's some really Pacey ones
but<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.549> wanted<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.079> for

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but I wanted really to get these for

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
but I wanted really to get these for
like<00:02:01.950> central<00:02:02.549> mid<00:02:02.729> players<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like central mid players in and this is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
like central mid players in and this is
the<00:02:03.750> only<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.990> I'd<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.259> able<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the only way I'd be able to do it so I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.730
