00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone i'm big 94 loquendo and this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.519
 it's a new video about another crap from 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.450
 ea game this time criticizing starfox of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.450
 atari 2600 that surely many will tell me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 because a game as great as starfox 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.430
 Super Nintendo was going to be bad because 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.529
 look may have been realized 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.230
 that being fox in europe is called star 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 window laila wars this is the fault 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 of starfox for atari 2600 that's right 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.690
 there is a star fox for the atari but not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 has talking animals does not have a fox 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.910
 mccloud or anything because he did the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.890
 unknown mighty company with in 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.399
 1983 right in the middle of the crisis of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.469
 videogames the result a fucking shit 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.690
 programmed by types who learned to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.120
 schedule games by mail without knowing 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 that a game is made in good time 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.289
 let's see the gameplay of this game and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 prepare to see a game that is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.850
 et level game alien 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.309
 for the same console but before 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.019
 I will say that I already know that the atari 2600 does not 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 they gave many graphics or gameplay 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.180
 but there are many better games for 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.690
 atari now let's see the quotes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.690
 game 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.640
 as in all atari games 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.229
 start with a game show 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.689
 that makes us see how much shit is 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.220
 have the certainty that the sound in 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.830
 This game has the worst effects 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 sounds of video games so I do not 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.190
 I am responsible for irreparable damage 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.880
 in the ears well let's start 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.880
 one 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.549
 shit and that shit of sound is all 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.920
 the one in the game never ends 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.720
 just repeat and look what's going to happen 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.440
 if someone will kill me 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.440
 everyone 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.450
 this is how this game sent me to take 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.910
 ass what a shame and shit the company 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800
 of video games but now let's talk about 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.510
 very bad controls 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.360
 it seems that the background actually 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.360
 you move not to your ship it is more comfortable to use 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.280
 the mouse as a control that the keys 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.320
 Let's talk about the history of the manual 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.390
 instructions says that a freighter robot 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.730
 shot by mistake the energy crystals 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.460
 in a planetoid and a rival command wants 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.280
 get them so controls starfox for 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.370
 pick them up the truth did not come much from the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.380
 history the common goal is to collect 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 all the crystals that were scattered 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.810
 on this planet but picking them up is a 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.060
 shit because the controls do not let you 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.190
 enter well where they are when you're 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500
 that coffee thing you can only move 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.810
 up or down which is also another point 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.180
 bad because if an enemy shoots you and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.470
 you do not react fast it kills you and the little face 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.470
 That sends you to the cock 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.030
 to this payment is the only weapon in the game 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.940
 98% failure often not enough 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.580
 healed it seems useless is used another 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.730
 What the fuck are those things that make 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.970
 on top of that gray shit a pagoda one 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.800
 crane a ship a building the creators 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 they would have worked a little harder on 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.390
 do the graphics I wonder if this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.870
 crap games used for method 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.780
 torture 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 another thing that I wonder is if the game 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.280
 It was done to the fart because other games of 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.290
 atari are great examples are the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.569
 babylon key com and talking about games 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.120
 it seems that this is a super version 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.280
 very loaded to defend not to do them 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.590
 suffer even more that I put the effects 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.599
 game sound I will not give a portion 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.599
 where they pass an epileptic screen 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.930
 and now 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.850
 shit shit I got tired of 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.850
 this game 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.190
 in conclusion a terrible gameplay 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.310
 some poorly designed graphics 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.820
 incomprehensible controls the sound ni 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.830
 talk now a few last data the reason 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.840
 why being fox is called different 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.970
 in Europe it is because mighty with registration 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.370
 the name in england and nintendo him 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.470
 he had to change his name and something else 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.570
 is that in the game box says game 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.040
 number one in the star fox saga 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.960
 xd xd xddddd what assholes are they believed that 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.030
 with their shit they would be the best company 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.760
 of games so they thought that a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.979
 second part would be released as I said 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.190
 a page we thank mighty with that 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.320
 they will not release the second part x 3 I hope 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
 that you liked this review 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.940
 once I make a critique of another game this 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.940
 end of the month comment denle finger up and 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.780
