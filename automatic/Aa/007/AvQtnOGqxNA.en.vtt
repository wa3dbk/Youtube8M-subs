 The croton, Codiaeum variegatum, is a small shrub of tropical origin 

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:32.571
 it produces a splendid foliage of varied color, from bright yellow to red, with green or white veins, very decorative 

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:38.577
 It is cultivated in an apartment and requires high environmental humidity all year long 

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:49.466
 For this reason it is necessary to keep the cultivation soil moist 

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:54.417
 but also frequently vaporize the foliage, using demineralized water 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:52.860
 The large leaves need to be cleaned of dust at least a couple of times a year to prevent them from getting dirty, with consequent poor plant development 

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:57.280
 we use a slightly damp microfibre cloth 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:06.460
 With this operation, in addition to cleaning the foliage of dust and smog, we will also have the advantage of removing any parasites
