00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
piece of tape I'm just gonna place that

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.650 
piece of tape I'm just gonna place that
on<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.350> top<00:00:15.530> part<00:00:15.769> of<00:00:15.830> my<00:00:16.010> nail<00:00:16.369> then<00:00:17.300> taking

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
on the top part of my nail then taking

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.880 
on the top part of my nail then taking
another<00:00:17.720> piece<00:00:18.050> I'm<00:00:18.260> gonna<00:00:18.410> connect<00:00:18.769> that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
another piece I'm gonna connect that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.159 
another piece I'm gonna connect that
diagonally<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:19.699> one<00:00:20.390> more<00:00:20.630> on<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.050> other

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
diagonally and one more on the other

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.899 
diagonally and one more on the other
side<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:21.679> this<00:00:21.859> is<00:00:21.919> just<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.369> create<00:00:22.550> a

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
side and this is just to create a

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.540 
side and this is just to create a
triangle<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.199> can<00:00:24.230> freehand<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:25.220> if<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.400> want

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
triangle you can freehand it if you want

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.370 
triangle you can freehand it if you want
to<00:00:25.759> then<00:00:26.089> I'm<00:00:26.210> taking<00:00:26.390> white<00:00:26.749> acrylic<00:00:26.989> paint

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
to then I'm taking white acrylic paint

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.710 
to then I'm taking white acrylic paint
and<00:00:27.589> painting<00:00:28.579> that<00:00:28.730> on<00:00:28.849> top<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:29.390> can<00:00:29.480> also

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
and painting that on top you can also

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.229 
and painting that on top you can also
use<00:00:30.109> white<00:00:30.349> nail<00:00:30.560> polish<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:31.189> didn't<00:00:31.909> have<00:00:32.060> any

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
use white nail polish I didn't have any

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.540 
use white nail polish I didn't have any
at<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.450> time<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.930> messed<00:00:33.739> up<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:34.010> little<00:00:34.160> bit<00:00:34.310> cuz

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
at the time I messed up a little bit cuz

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.270 
at the time I messed up a little bit cuz
apparently<00:00:34.700> I<00:00:35.030> just<00:00:35.180> suck<00:00:36.080> at<00:00:36.110> doing<00:00:36.440> that<00:00:36.860> so

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
apparently I just suck at doing that so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.700 
apparently I just suck at doing that so
I<00:00:37.310> took<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.790> toothpick<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.540> sort<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.840> fix<00:00:39.560> the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
I took a toothpick and sort of fix the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.630 
I took a toothpick and sort of fix the
shape<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.070> bit

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
shape a bit

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.319 
shape a bit
then<00:00:42.390> taking<00:00:42.720> some<00:00:42.899> foil<00:00:43.649> stickers<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.970> just

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
then taking some foil stickers I'm just

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.990 
then taking some foil stickers I'm just
going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> place<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.290> my<00:00:46.379> nail<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.220> I'm

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
going to place that on my nail so I'm

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
going to place that on my nail so I'm
just<00:00:48.210> gonna<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.379> outline<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just gonna use it to outline the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.290 
just gonna use it to outline the
triangle<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.760> made

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.209 

then<00:00:54.020> cut<00:00:54.410> it

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.840 

and<00:00:57.820> then<00:00:58.570> place<00:00:59.440> another<00:00:59.739> piece<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.460> connect

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
and then place another piece and connect

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850 
and then place another piece and connect
those<00:01:01.000> pieces

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.130 

and<00:01:03.950> then<00:01:04.760> I'm<00:01:04.879> gonna<00:01:05.000> cut<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.270> strip<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and then I'm gonna cut a strip on the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.530 
and then I'm gonna cut a strip on the
top<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.710> think<00:01:07.160> this<00:01:07.340> would<00:01:07.490> also<00:01:07.760> work<00:01:08.090> even

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
top I think this would also work even

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.780 
top I think this would also work even
better<00:01:08.690> if<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.170> use<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:09.590> regular<00:01:10.190> nail<00:01:10.460> oil

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
better if you use like regular nail oil

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.640 
better if you use like regular nail oil
because<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:11.870> would<00:01:11.960> probably<00:01:12.140> stick<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.500> lot

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
because that would probably stick a lot

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.230 
because that would probably stick a lot
better<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.070> your<00:01:13.160> nail<00:01:13.370> and<00:01:13.640> now<00:01:13.940> for<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
better to your nail and now for the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.210 
better to your nail and now for the
actual<00:01:14.480> Iron<00:01:14.780> Man<00:01:15.080> I'm<00:01:15.290> going<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.770> take<00:01:16.010> a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
actual Iron Man I'm going to take a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.730 
actual Iron Man I'm going to take a
yellow<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.180> just<00:01:17.510> paint<00:01:17.780> two<00:01:17.990> lines<00:01:18.230> then

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
yellow and just paint two lines then

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.850 
yellow and just paint two lines then
connect<00:01:19.610> them<00:01:19.850> using<00:01:20.390> another<00:01:20.600> line<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.800> I'm

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
connect them using another line and I'm

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.210 
connect them using another line and I'm
gonna<00:01:22.010> create<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.370> diagonal<00:01:22.820> line<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.220> then

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
gonna create a diagonal line and then

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700 
gonna create a diagonal line and then
another<00:01:25.640> one<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.930> going<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.350> face

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
another one that is going to face

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.280 
another one that is going to face
inwards<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.490> little<00:01:28.760> bit

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
inwards a little bit

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.980 
inwards a little bit
and<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.280> create<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:32.150> more<00:01:32.360> diagonal<00:01:32.840> line

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
and then create one more diagonal line

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.500 
and then create one more diagonal line
facing<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.070> opposite<00:01:34.550> direction<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.390> it's

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
facing the opposite direction so it's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.460 
facing the opposite direction so it's
like<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.690> really<00:01:36.080> wide<00:01:36.320> Vee

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.500 

then<00:01:40.310> I'm<00:01:40.370> going<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.520> create<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.850> curved<00:01:41.300> line

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
then I'm going to create a curved line

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.960 
then I'm going to create a curved line
going<00:01:42.200> inward<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.980> leaving<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.460> space<00:01:43.760> at<00:01:43.940> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
going inward and leaving a space at the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.900 
going inward and leaving a space at the
bottom<00:01:45.040> once<00:01:46.040> we<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.370> I'm<00:01:46.760> going<00:01:46.790> to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
bottom once we have that I'm going to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.690 
bottom once we have that I'm going to
create<00:01:47.060> another<00:01:47.210> diagonal<00:01:47.840> line

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
create another diagonal line

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.050 
create another diagonal line
and<00:01:49.810> then<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.079> curved<00:01:51.530> line<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.310> connect

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and then a curved line to connect

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.490 
and then a curved line to connect
everything<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.810> I'm<00:01:53.930> gonna<00:01:54.020> fill<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.409> in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
everything and I'm gonna fill that in

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.980 
everything and I'm gonna fill that in
now<00:01:57.460> taking<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:58.000> clean<00:01:58.210> toothpick<00:01:58.660> I'm<00:01:58.810> just

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
now taking a clean toothpick I'm just

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.170 
now taking a clean toothpick I'm just
gonna<00:01:59.140> fix<00:01:59.440> up<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.770> edges<00:02:00.160> we<00:02:00.580> would<00:02:00.700> probably

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
gonna fix up the edges we would probably

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660 
gonna fix up the edges we would probably
not<00:02:01.300> want<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.900> use<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.890> much<00:02:03.040> acrylic<00:02:03.460> paint

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
not want to use so much acrylic paint

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.960 
not want to use so much acrylic paint
that<00:02:03.880> way<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.300> easier<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.350> fix<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:06.220> edges<00:02:06.730> I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
that way it's easier to fix the edges I

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.760 
that way it's easier to fix the edges I
made<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.450> mistake<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.810> actually<00:02:08.170> doing<00:02:08.740> a

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
made the mistake of actually doing a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
made the mistake of actually doing a
couple<00:02:09.040> of<00:02:09.130> layers<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.729> get<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.060> really<00:02:10.270> opaque

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
couple of layers to get it really opaque

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.750 
couple of layers to get it really opaque
and<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.380> bit<00:02:11.530> harder<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.100> fix<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and so it's a bit harder to fix the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.550 
and so it's a bit harder to fix the
mistakes<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.720> sort<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.050> peels<00:02:14.350> off

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
mistakes because it sort of peels off

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.330 
mistakes because it sort of peels off
instead<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> scratches<00:02:15.430> off

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.309 

now<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.270> create<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
now I'm gonna create a little bit of a

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.620 
now I'm gonna create a little bit of a
curve<00:02:20.770> I'm<00:02:21.370> gonna<00:02:21.580> call<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.910> his<00:02:22.090> cheekbone

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
curve I'm gonna call this his cheekbone

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.309 
curve I'm gonna call this his cheekbone
so<00:02:23.470> pretty<00:02:24.250> much<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:25.060> gonna<00:02:25.239> be<00:02:25.510> somewhat<00:02:26.200> of

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
so pretty much it's gonna be somewhat of

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.110 
so pretty much it's gonna be somewhat of
a<00:02:26.380> triangle<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.160> you're<00:02:27.640> gonna<00:02:27.760> want<00:02:28.000> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
a triangle and you're gonna want that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.540 
a triangle and you're gonna want that
little<00:02:28.480> point<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:29.080> his<00:02:29.380> cheekbone<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.400> be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
little point on his cheekbone to be

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.600 
little point on his cheekbone to be
about<00:02:30.819> halfway<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:32.080> nail

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
about halfway on your nail

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.059 
about halfway on your nail
like<00:02:34.480> that

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
like that

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.800 
like that
and<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:36.939> going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.120> take<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.329> little<00:02:37.599> bit<00:02:37.750> more

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
and I'm going to take a little bit more

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.930 
and I'm going to take a little bit more
off<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.709> hollow<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.099> his<00:02:39.459> cheek

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.250 

you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.350 

so<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:51.190> you're<00:02:51.340> facing<00:02:51.580> forward

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
so that when you're facing forward

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750 
so that when you're facing forward
you'll<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:53.019> able<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.560> see<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.549> should<00:02:54.730> look

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you'll be able to see so it should look

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.699 
you'll be able to see so it should look
something<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.959> now<00:02:56.319> for<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
something like that and now for the

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.369 
something like that and now for the
bottom<00:02:56.920> part<00:02:57.069> I'm<00:02:57.909> just<00:02:58.299> gonna<00:02:58.480> try<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.870> angle

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
bottom part I'm just gonna try and angle

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.030 
bottom part I'm just gonna try and angle
those<00:02:59.950> diagonal<00:03:00.340> lines<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.879> I<00:03:00.909> made<00:03:01.120> earlier

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
those diagonal lines that I made earlier

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.190 
those diagonal lines that I made earlier
on<00:03:03.760> each<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.330> sides<00:03:04.569> they're<00:03:04.959> pretty

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
on each of the sides they're pretty

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.309 
on each of the sides they're pretty
short<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:06.269> then<00:03:07.269> try<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.480> create<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.019> curved

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
short and then try to create that curved

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.559 
short and then try to create that curved
cut<00:03:08.560> off<00:03:08.680> part<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.340> bottom<00:03:09.640> at<00:03:10.090> times<00:03:10.420> I

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
cut off part on the bottom at times I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.089 
cut off part on the bottom at times I
thought<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> shape<00:03:11.230> was<00:03:11.409> a<00:03:11.439> bit<00:03:11.650> off<00:03:11.799> so

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
thought that the shape was a bit off so

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.130 
thought that the shape was a bit off so
what<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.370> did<00:03:12.489> was<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.879> repainted<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.930> then

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
what I did was I repainted it and then

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.479 
what I did was I repainted it and then
fix<00:03:14.439> the<00:03:14.590> shape<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.950> again<00:03:15.220> with<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
fix the shape up again with the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.410 
fix the shape up again with the
toothpick

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.900 

and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.350> final<00:03:19.590> detail<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and then a final detail is just to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.080 
and then a final detail is just to
create<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.810> rectangular<00:03:22.650> cutout<00:03:23.130> right<00:03:23.819> at<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
create a rectangular cutout right at the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.210 
create a rectangular cutout right at the
bottom

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.520 

now<00:03:30.880> taking<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.360> black<00:03:31.600> I'm<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.260> create

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
now taking a black I'm going to create

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.410 
now taking a black I'm going to create
his<00:03:32.680> mouth<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.280> I'm<00:03:33.370> just<00:03:33.520> gonna<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> short

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
his mouth so I'm just gonna do a short

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.190 
his mouth so I'm just gonna do a short
diagonal<00:03:34.810> line<00:03:36.120> then<00:03:37.120> an<00:03:37.300> upward<00:03:37.780> diagonal

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
diagonal line then an upward diagonal

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.640 
diagonal line then an upward diagonal
line<00:03:40.230> then<00:03:41.230> go<00:03:41.590> straight<00:03:41.920> across<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.650> repeat

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
line then go straight across and repeat

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.350 
line then go straight across and repeat
on<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.010> other<00:03:45.040> side<00:03:45.580> in<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.000> opposite

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
on the other side in the opposite

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:55.380 
on the other side in the opposite
direction

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.850 

his<00:03:56.390> eyes<00:03:56.660> gonna<00:03:56.959> start<00:03:57.260> from<00:03:57.410> two<00:03:57.650> imaginary

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
his eyes gonna start from two imaginary

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.490 
his eyes gonna start from two imaginary
lines<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.879> connect<00:03:59.300> from<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.959> cheekbone

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
lines that connect from this cheekbone

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.089 
lines that connect from this cheekbone
and<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:01.580> line<00:04:01.819> right<00:04:02.060> here<00:04:02.830> starting<00:04:03.830> right

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
and that line right here starting right

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.890 
and that line right here starting right
there<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.879> I'm<00:04:04.940> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.090> create<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.360> slanted

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
there so I'm going to create a slanted

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.380 
there so I'm going to create a slanted
line<00:04:06.550> going<00:04:07.550> one<00:04:07.819> way<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:10.630> he<00:04:11.630> straight<00:04:12.290> line

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
line going one way and he straight line

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.360 
line going one way and he straight line
another<00:04:14.390> slanted<00:04:15.200> line<00:04:15.380> in<00:04:15.680> another<00:04:16.070> straight

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
another slanted line in another straight

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.460 
another slanted line in another straight
line<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.790> at<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.329> right<00:04:17.540> end<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.989> slanted

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
line and at the right end that slanted

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.780 
line and at the right end that slanted
line<00:04:18.620> should<00:04:18.950> have<00:04:19.040> been<00:04:19.160> in<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.370> opposite

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
line should have been in the opposite

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.460 
line should have been in the opposite
direction<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.450> I'll<00:04:20.570> fix<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.900> later<00:04:21.139> now

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
direction but I'll fix that later now

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.930 
direction but I'll fix that later now
going<00:04:21.859> back<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.310> black<00:04:22.580> I'm<00:04:22.760> going<00:04:22.880> to

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
going back to the black I'm going to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.090 
going back to the black I'm going to
connect<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.810> two<00:04:24.020> eyes<00:04:24.229> together<00:04:24.710> like

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
connect the two eyes together like

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.850 
connect the two eyes together like
glasses<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.910> then<00:04:26.570> on<00:04:26.780> each<00:04:27.229> side<00:04:27.620> I'm<00:04:27.770> going

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
glasses and then on each side I'm going

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.550 
glasses and then on each side I'm going
to<00:04:27.950> create<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.310> line<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:29.210> add<00:04:29.419> some<00:04:29.780> depth<00:04:30.080> then

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
to create a line to add some depth then

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.500 
to create a line to add some depth then
I<00:04:30.590> mix<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.010> yellow<00:04:31.460> color<00:04:31.729> with<00:04:32.000> some<00:04:32.240> brown

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
I mix that yellow color with some brown

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.600 
I mix that yellow color with some brown
to<00:04:32.780> darken<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.229> up<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.500> I'm<00:04:33.800> just<00:04:33.919> going<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
to darken it up a bit I'm just going to

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.120 
to darken it up a bit I'm just going to
go<00:04:34.820> on<00:04:35.030> top<00:04:35.330> of<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.630> eyes<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.229> outline<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
go on top of the eyes and outline the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.700 
go on top of the eyes and outline the
eyes<00:04:38.169> then<00:04:39.169> I'm<00:04:39.260> going<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> create<00:04:39.590> two

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
eyes then I'm going to create two

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.650 
eyes then I'm going to create two
slanted<00:04:40.370> lines<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.940> make<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.120> look<00:04:41.240> like<00:04:41.540> he

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
slanted lines to make it look like he

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.080 
slanted lines to make it look like he
has<00:04:41.810> some<00:04:42.169> cheekbones<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.400> jawline<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
has some cheekbones and a jawline and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
has some cheekbones and a jawline and
ellipses

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
ellipses

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.180 
ellipses
and<00:04:46.569> create<00:04:47.569> two<00:04:47.720> lines<00:04:47.930> from<00:04:48.229> those<00:04:48.530> two

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
and create two lines from those two

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.850 
and create two lines from those two
endpoints<00:04:49.699> of<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.330> mouth<00:04:50.509> and<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:51.650> add<00:04:51.800> some

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
endpoints of the mouth and just add some

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.340 
endpoints of the mouth and just add some
lines<00:04:52.400> on<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.819> sides<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.180> his<00:04:53.240> head

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.100 

after<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.430> sort<00:05:01.670> of<00:05:01.760> fixed<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.180> eye

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
after that I sort of fixed the eye

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.290 
after that I sort of fixed the eye
may<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.919> black<00:05:04.280> lines<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.669> little<00:05:04.759> bit<00:05:04.970> thinner

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
may the black lines a little bit thinner

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.510 
may the black lines a little bit thinner
I'm<00:05:05.539> gonna<00:05:05.840> go<00:05:06.020> ahead<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.229> fix<00:05:06.680> some<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.280> the

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
I'm gonna go ahead and fix some of the

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.240 
I'm gonna go ahead and fix some of the
mouths<00:05:07.789> with<00:05:08.270> some<00:05:08.720> yellow<00:05:09.199> paints<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.129> I

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
mouths with some yellow paints and I

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.010 
mouths with some yellow paints and I
basically<00:05:10.460> just<00:05:10.759> fixed<00:05:11.270> any<00:05:11.419> lines<00:05:11.659> that<00:05:11.870> I

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
basically just fixed any lines that I

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.010 
basically just fixed any lines that I
wanted<00:05:12.319> to<00:05:12.409> be<00:05:12.680> more<00:05:12.830> neat<00:05:13.069> and<00:05:13.659> the<00:05:14.659> final

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
wanted to be more neat and the final

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.409 
wanted to be more neat and the final
step<00:05:15.319> was<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.949> create<00:05:16.069> a<00:05:16.250> darker<00:05:16.699> red<00:05:16.909> and<00:05:17.180> just

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
step was to create a darker red and just

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.469 
step was to create a darker red and just
outline<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.199> whole<00:05:18.590> yellow<00:05:19.370> face<00:05:19.879> then<00:05:20.449> I

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
outline the whole yellow face then I

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.290 
outline the whole yellow face then I
added<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:21.020> topcoat<00:05:21.289> and<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.949> was<00:05:22.099> it<00:05:22.430> you<00:05:22.759> can

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
added a topcoat and that was it you can

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.879 
added a topcoat and that was it you can
obviously<00:05:23.720> do<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.080> bunch<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:24.560> different

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
obviously do a bunch of different

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.040 
obviously do a bunch of different
designs<00:05:25.039> for<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.819> rest<00:05:26.000> of<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.240> nails<00:05:26.449> I'm

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
designs for the rest of the nails I'm

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.719 
designs for the rest of the nails I'm
