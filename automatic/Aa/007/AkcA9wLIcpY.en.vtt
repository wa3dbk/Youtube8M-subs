00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.080
 If someone knew what the viola speaks In the corner of the room to my heart 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.780
 A different language loose ... Kiss my mouth like a song 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.940
 My father who was a born violet player Learned in the woods to live life 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.160
 I hunted, suffered 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.320
 Fought but learned 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 I live on your lesson today. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.460
 If someone knew what the viola sings When the sun rises to wake us up 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.240
 Green forests, rivers and mountains Hope is waiting to start again. 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:36.500
 I carry in my eyes my dream boy I follow the fate that followed my father 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.020
 Viola and singer 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 Love story 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.060
 And this love makes us sing 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.520
 Today I know what the viola sings When the sun rises, my father taught me 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 Viola waves to the day that ends And welcome to what began 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:30.920
 Who does not know the language of the people You think different and want to learn 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.140
 My father taught me 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.060
 Today I am a singer. 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.540
 And I also want to teach you. 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.600
 Now I know why my old man cries When he looks, in the look of longing 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:26.000
 He plays the viola with his slow fingers. 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.080
 In his embrace the viola cries My old man looks and cries too 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.160
 Cry my teacher 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.540
 Viola and singer 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.480
 A story of happiness.
