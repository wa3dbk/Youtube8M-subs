characters<00:02:52.620> kept<00:02:52.920> shifting<00:02:53.250> from<00:02:53.730> some<00:02:54.000> sort

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

of<00:02:54.420> Asian<00:02:55.020> accent<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.620> something<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.070> sounds

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
of Asian accent to something that sounds

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.270 
of Asian accent to something that sounds
like<00:02:56.550> Game<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.239> Thrones<00:02:57.390> meets<00:02:58.020> Spartacus<00:02:58.800> two

doing this this kind of handshake kind

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.330 
doing this this kind of handshake kind
of<00:03:09.840> thing<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.470> might<00:03:10.830> sound<00:03:11.130> like

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
of thing this might sound like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.460 
of thing this might sound like
nitpicking<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.420> me<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.630> was<00:03:12.690> these<00:03:13.140> types

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
nitpicking but for me it was these types

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.840 
nitpicking but for me it was these types
of<00:03:13.620> things<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.950> drew<00:03:14.340> me<00:03:14.489> out<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
of things that drew me out of the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
experience which wasn't very easy to get
