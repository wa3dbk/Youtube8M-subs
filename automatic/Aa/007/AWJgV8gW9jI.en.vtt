variety of other cooks and recipes

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.349 
variety of other cooks and recipes
suggest<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> put<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:49.739> cake

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
suggest that you put this on the cake

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.819 
suggest that you put this on the cake
but<00:02:51.359> actually<00:02:51.689> the<00:02:51.780> cake<00:02:51.989> falls<00:02:52.319> apart<00:02:52.650> and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
but actually the cake falls apart and

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.209 
but actually the cake falls apart and
moves<00:02:53.069> all<00:02:53.189> over<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.489> place<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.879> do<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.060> so

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:55.219 
moves all over the place to do that so

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.679 
moves all over the place to do that so
we're<00:02:56.219> not<00:02:56.280> going<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:59.239> the<00:03:00.239> butter<00:03:00.420> icing

now at this stage what we really need
but<00:05:36.130> what<00:05:36.310> we<00:05:36.430> haven't<00:05:36.760> got<00:05:37.230> is<00:05:38.230> a<00:05:38.290> microwave

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:47.760 
but what we haven't got is a microwave
turntable<00:05:42.600> so<00:05:43.600> we<00:05:43.780> can<00:05:45.090> turn<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.300> round<00:05:46.480> and<00:05:47.020> do

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
turntable so we can turn it round and do

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.270 
turntable so we can turn it round and do
the<00:05:47.950> thing<00:05:48.190> from<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.840> angry<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:49.960> TV<00:05:50.410> advert<00:05:50.860> I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
the thing from the angry on TV advert I

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.830 
the thing from the angry on TV advert I
think<00:05:51.790> you<00:05:51.850> should<00:05:52.000> do<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.270> theme<00:05:52.480> from<00:05:52.660> the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
think you should do the theme from the

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.030 
think you should do the theme from the
whitefly<00:05:53.350> though<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:55.300> tell<00:05:55.570> me<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.680> isn't

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
whitefly though that tell me that isn't

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.520
