United States do you think that you can
act<00:02:17.060> without<00:02:17.360> Congress<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.770> initiate<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
act without Congress on to initiate a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.840

no-fly zone in Syria without
congressional<00:02:23.240> approval<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.640> know<00:02:25.730> again

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
congressional approval you know again

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.620 
congressional approval you know again
our<00:02:27.710> goal<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:29.390> seek

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
our goal would be to to seek

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.440 
our goal would be to to seek
international<00:02:30.320> permission<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.850> would<00:02:32.030> we

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
international permission and we would we

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.510 
international permission and we would we
would<00:02:32.480> come<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.110> Congress<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.010> inform

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
would come to the Congress and inform

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.690 
would come to the Congress and inform
you<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.540> determine<00:02:36.320> how<00:02:37.130> best<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.670> approach

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
you and determine how best to approach

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.750 
you and determine how best to approach
this<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.630> whether<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.410> not<00:02:39.560> we<00:02:39.770> would<00:02:39.920> want<00:02:40.640> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
this so whether or not we would want to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.390 
this so whether or not we would want to
get<00:02:40.880> permission<00:02:41.810> from<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.260> Congress<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.950> think

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
get permission from the Congress I think

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.010 
get permission from the Congress I think
those<00:02:43.580> are<00:02:43.610> issues<00:02:44.090> we<00:02:44.510> would<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.870> to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
those are issues we would have to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.780 
those are issues we would have to
discuss<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.590> we<00:02:45.770> decide<00:02:46.100> what<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.550> here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790

and were able to move together then

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.140 
and were able to move together then
obviously<00:04:33.230> we<00:04:33.590> would<00:04:33.980> seek<00:04:34.220> whatever<00:04:34.460> legal

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
obviously we would seek whatever legal

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
that justified I mean you know we can't

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
resolution as it did in Libya we would

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.910 
resolution as it did in Libya we would
do<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.650> if<00:04:58.540> if<00:04:59.540> NATO<00:04:59.900> came<00:05:00.200> together<00:05:00.410> as<00:05:00.800> we

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
do that if if NATO came together as we

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.610 
do that if if NATO came together as we
did<00:05:01.070> in<00:05:01.100> Bosnia<00:05:01.670> we<00:05:02.330> would<00:05:02.480> rely<00:05:02.750> on<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.200> so

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
did in Bosnia we would rely on that so

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.240 
did in Bosnia we would rely on that so
you<00:05:04.040> know<00:05:04.130> we<00:05:04.310> have<00:05:04.730> options<00:05:05.600> here<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.770> we<00:05:07.010> want

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
you know we have options here if we want

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.460 
you know we have options here if we want
to<00:05:07.310> build<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.060> kind<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.510> international

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
to build the kind of international

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.560 
to build the kind of international
approach<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:10.310> dealing<00:05:10.490> with<00:05:10.670> the<00:05:10.850> system<00:05:11.090> for

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
approach to dealing with the system for

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.050 
approach to dealing with the system for
all<00:05:11.750> by<00:05:12.020> having<00:05:12.380> an<00:05:12.590> international<00:05:13.490> support

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
all by having an international support

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.400 
all by having an international support
but<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:15.580> really<00:05:16.580> baffled<00:05:17.210> by<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.600> idea<00:05:18.170> that

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
but I really baffled by the idea that

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.190 
but I really baffled by the idea that
that<00:05:19.220> somehow<00:05:19.790> an<00:05:20.150> international<00:05:20.810> assembly

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
that somehow an international assembly

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.040 
that somehow an international assembly
provides<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.220> legal<00:05:22.700> basis<00:05:23.210> for<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.810> United

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
provides a legal basis for the United

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.830 
provides a legal basis for the United
States<00:05:24.170> military<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.040> be<00:05:25.160> deployed<00:05:25.550> in<00:05:25.850> combat

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
States military to be deployed in combat

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.860 
States military to be deployed in combat
I<00:05:27.080> don't<00:05:27.680> believe<00:05:27.919> it's<00:05:28.340> close<00:05:28.790> to<00:05:28.870> being

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
I don't believe it's close to being

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.920 
I don't believe it's close to being
correct<00:05:30.340> they<00:05:31.340> provide<00:05:32.000> no<00:05:32.360> legal<00:05:32.810> authority

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
correct they provide no legal authority

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.100 
correct they provide no legal authority
the<00:05:33.830> only<00:05:34.100> legal<00:05:34.310> authority<00:05:34.940> that's<00:05:35.570> required

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
the only legal authority that's required

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.030 
the only legal authority that's required
to<00:05:36.590> deploy<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.070> United<00:05:37.310> States<00:05:37.460> military<00:05:38.240> is

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
to deploy the United States military is

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.100 
to deploy the United States military is
