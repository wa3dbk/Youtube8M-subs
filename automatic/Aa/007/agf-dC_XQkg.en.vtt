00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello, I will tell you today what 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 ways you can connect the load to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.889
 arduino 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.309
 us the fact is that everyone faces 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.960
 over time with a problem 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.619
 well connect a stronger load to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 arduino 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 initial projects are mainly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 LEDs are used which directly 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 connects to arduino 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 but if help something not connect 100 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.480
 LED backlight motors and so on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.600
 directly impossible to use 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 something else here today tell you what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 operations there is a way to connect 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 loads and so the first is the easiest 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.370
 the most basic way is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.370
 transistor see me on the screen 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:01.440
 this connection is not very powerful 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:05.119
 loads so let's say such a simple way 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.670
 cheap reliable cons is that 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.299
 There are a lot of transistors 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.850
 species many field and bipolar 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.119
 marking all different markings 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 legs basically not provided happens 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.420
 on transistors and their power is not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.729
 so big so there is one more 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 way more powerful load can 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.890
 connects using composite 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:44.780
 transistors or in particular microcircuits 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.780
 l293d on my hands here on the screen 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 here as I said, help cannot 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:59.430
 load connect a few watts can 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.230
 be even well a radiator cooling this 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 there is no chip so 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.870
 a very powerful load will not work either 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.420
 connect here by the way if options for 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.720
 arduino are ready here this scheme 293 100 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 inserted straight into the shield there are two of them 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.500
 decided for arduino directly responds 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.460
 so here in the arduino nano from the way 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.510
 convenient reliable but i'm fine this one 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.100
 bought a bill but never used in 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.940
 there is such a small minus 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.150
 the fact is that it takes all the ports 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.210
 arduino including the rxtx port that is 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.910
 serial port send transmission information 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.230
 and drive 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.780
 when you stick it in like this not 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.940
 accept not receive information through 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.310
 the serial port is no longer possible and this 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.010
 Well, how would such a thing in itself 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.890
 it turns out does not send does not transmit 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.120
 information, that is, but I have no such 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.740
 I really like to do such projects in 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.250
 general no i don't miss lost ports so 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.080
 that this is a long-awaited purchase from me 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 it was but in the end I never 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.620
 used thought cool stuff though if 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.500
 would they 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.550
 although I can solder a couple here 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 wiring we somehow do me already to you 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.260
 I want because I have here too 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:45.590
 one more shield no shield this driver 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:48.930
 l293d l298 driver 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.010
 it already has a powerful good radiator 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 he can already be connected more seriously 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.819
 load q turns on all pretty 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.680
 I'm just the way already in one of the videos 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.579
 told how to connect on 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.329
 LED load through this driver 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.819
 to arduine 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.489
 I can leave the link to the video 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.670
 to the transistor how to connect arduino 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:19.549
 I also made a video link below 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.190
 will be so to this video is not and apparently not 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.169
 there will be the next option means 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:30.680
 connection is a relay 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:33.199
 they are single channel relyushki here 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.090
 such as on the dual-channel screen 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:41.350
 that's how I here she is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:45.100
 dual channel 8 also channel either 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.510
 16-channel largest 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.169
 labeling on these trout ears can 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:57.080
 connect already more serious load 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:05:00.740
 250 volts 10 amps written that is 220 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.199
 volt can I connect the video too 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.930
 did connect a light bulb through this 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:11.139
 Relyushku link leave who wants 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.289
 look can see and also 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.760
 it happens 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.000
 Relyushki Well, they are almost the same only 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.520
 more modern hurts cooking 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.370
 are called solid state relays 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.500
 there is a small small 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.070
 personal advantage is these measures 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.289
 ryushkami they mappers silent here these 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.909
 relyushki click them if in room 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:40.909
 set to hear if something in general 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.720
 heard in any case the car who 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.190
 set click hard 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.930
 solid-state taxiing no longer click and 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.509
 switching frequency if needed 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.000
 these are higher than being well and I'm reliable 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:59.570
 I think above for the same reason 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.580
 generally through these 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.949
 relyushki how to connect the load video 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:11.550
 also as leave a link can see 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:17.180
 that is , only I am left of this 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:19.979
 did not show these l293d microcircuits 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:27.539
 where he never did for some reason 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:30.509
 missed the poison this moment next time 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.910
 then see the next video 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.910
 I will show how to connect this circuit to 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.630
 arduino and how to manage load with 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.910
 using me here on this I think everything 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.240
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.000
 who video was helpful put likes 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.699
 huskies 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.889
 helps a lot and in the development of the channel so 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.289
 what we do not hesitate to put 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.039
 if someone likes thanks for 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.039
 attention all bye
