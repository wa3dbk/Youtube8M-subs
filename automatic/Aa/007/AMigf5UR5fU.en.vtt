00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.809
 I draw your attention that the first lesson 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.529
 with automatic we produce without a belt 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.959
 the belt is specially unfastened for 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.880
 that the best felt already initially 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.070
 the belt is a little in the way and not to 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.670
 shoot down cadet we try primary 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.710
 all actions produce weapons in the hands 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.150
 what we now have in hand is worth Machine 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.770
 on the chuck guard in the chamber 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 No, then I do 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.059
 the movement range is physiological if i 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.800
 I keep the machine look carefully as 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.899
 I have already explained if I have this one 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.690
 finger here this finger is on 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.809
 store that is a guide for 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.179
 if I take off the machine on the enemy 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.739
 or in the direction of the target finger this one 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.100
 machine gunners put on protect 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.339
 in the midst of these 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.050
 explain again automatically on 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.339
 give it means this is the shop 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.559
 is my guide for finger weapons 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.440
 I lay hold fuse Weapon 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.010
 in relation to the floor then do not sit in the corner 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 90 degrees see but I can and so 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.490
 I work no matter what it is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 almost no difference can and so 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.530
 but initially look at the small 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.969
 such moment of rotation there is no rotation 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.240
 serves to me was not about but 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.240
 outside again and I took off 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.609
 fuse now this finger well 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:32.840
 once again begin to sculpt the thumb 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:36.020
 hands steps on the shutter after all, and 1 more times 2 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.929
 I took closing the shutter pulled bye 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.070
 the shutter passes this distance 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.549
 see how much time it will take me 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.359
 well after somewhere less for this time 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.990
 must catch 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:51.560
 handle and press the trigger so I removed 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.640
 all unnecessary movement first shot can 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.569
 do once more 1 1 3 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.999
 one more time rotation two three bets 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.439
 means at a different angle to sting and if 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.829
 me here 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.450
 finger on the store then when raising the gun 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.340
 automatically it hits the sheet 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.570
 will go about to protect 1 more time 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:21.580
 1 1 now here is this finger here is this finger 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.580
 steps and shows passes this part 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 he gets here and the machine is already fighting 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.400
 ready i can already start the fire yet 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.820
 consider 1 23 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.910
 one more time two three now we complicate 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.910
 action look 1 2 3
