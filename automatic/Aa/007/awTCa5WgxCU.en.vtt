00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.450

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.920

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.970
 I did a lot of tutorials there I 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.860
 have not all of them here and recently I have 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.990
 launched in a new series these are 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 the tags nbt says so what is that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.770
 are the tags and elites those details that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.800
 dear minecraft who are apparently 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.319
 invisible there we can not use them in 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.910
 game apart by mixing a mode that 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.819
 allow to have them in play but 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.080
 otherwise we can do it with nbt editors 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:38.890
 web and explore or wang been told and that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.800
 allows us to change tags nbt this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 which allows a lot of things by 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.600
 example whose last tutorial 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.310
