00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.820
 Once two times two three I went 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 you're on a horse a big question I was asked 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.590
 Well, the last time the tooth than it is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.149
 not 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:39.530
 records for such a zoom h4n and from 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 he is actually the signal on the wire 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 here are my buttonholes, and then 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.850
 accordingly the whole thing on click 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.250
 synchronized in the editor 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 synchronized editor and wins 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.899
 actually here with the help of a buttonhole i 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 this level of sound in such issues here 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.090
 to a new level 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 chalk basically still quite like 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 this sound its true a bit 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.290
 I probably process now 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 I will write a separate lesson about how I mean 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.369
 process sound with the help of the stuffing himself 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 I usually have 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.400
 means normalizing your voice and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 opportunities removing noise and because u 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.140
 I have a computer here a little noise 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.759
 but often with a buttonhole in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 principle when all this is recorded is your mind 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.740
 I can hardly hear it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.740
 I'm getting ready now is to shoot a new one 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.619
 video and try to make it so 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.979
 format is not just that in the background 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.259
 will study and this one here at fonchik 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.770
 me so small moving here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.770
 feat 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.610
 in general, okay , I'll put it here now 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.220
 accordingly, then most likely there 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.800
 something to replace me 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 now you just want to put a lot of light 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 on the background light on myself and stuff I don't know no 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.270
 I have time now because I 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.780
 getting ready I 'm not preparing now the main thing 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.840
 write down 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 Again, the main thing is the informational 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.080
 filling so consider her rabbits 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.020
 this format here now will be 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.910
 a lesson about how I will clean my sound 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.550
 about there basically two three filters 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.380
 nothing complicated i mean i think 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.140
 minutes for 2 3 I'll explain it to you 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.810
 again if you will write sound 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.860
 so you know how it is anyway 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.490
 equalize yes to the pitch of your voice 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 normalize if your near level and 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.920
 again remove some noise 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.450
 if you have a sample order here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.880
 now I have some noise 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.880
 small let's be quiet for 2 seconds 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.550
 someone in the hallway he goes there again 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:13.310
 hard to hear again here and here this 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.310
 the noise pattern will be used later as 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.380
 let's say such a drawing pattern is called 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.810
 that is like a pad to make that noise 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.910
 extract from the path where I say that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.250
 There is something like this and in some small 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.130
 frequency band and will just be removed 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.550
 which noisy is important to understand that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.830
 if the noise is so strong thunder whale 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.260
 with this modernity you are also from 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.540
 from out distort the sound if the noise is very 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.890
 strong then and voice being very strong 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.570
 searched distorted and already here it is necessary anyway 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.280
 watch that the noise was some such 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.370
 small 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.780
 Well, in general, as regards all look a lesson 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.530
 I will write now 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.400
 I will correct cranes I will write video about 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.320
 lenses such affairs were all with you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.350
