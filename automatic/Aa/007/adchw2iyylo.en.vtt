to the other side I actually like the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580

down I think it's kind of funky but I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.940 
down I think it's kind of funky but I
took<00:02:40.000> those<00:02:40.420> two<00:02:40.690> two<00:02:41.020> strand<00:02:41.290> twists<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
took those two two strand twists and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
took those two two strand twists and
tied<00:02:42.310> them<00:02:42.520> together<00:02:42.730> with<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.570> black<00:02:43.870> rubber

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
tied them together with a black rubber

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.380 
tied them together with a black rubber
band<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.830> create<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.580> kind<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> bohemian

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
