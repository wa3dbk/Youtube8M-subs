00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:11.170
 [Music] 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 to create our own 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.490
 aprea mix cold 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.940
 let's go into a new project file under the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.890
 list iphone expect system we find 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 application and try a list of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 templates that are pre 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.940
 ie project configurations 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.530
 of the presets that allow us 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.870
 in this case open gl to start 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 to program the game of norton gl in 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.410
 this case instead of bass application 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.739
 make the gem applications 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.490
 basic generic preconfiguration in fact 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:11.410
 we will use this we call the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 our project and we find this 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:21.550
 window this window which is a that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.110
 which describes our project 4 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.450
 we have a list of all feins and 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.479
 selecting the planting of false labor 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.670
 this class group we find the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.710
 content we are also taking 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.220
 this button see the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:42.850
 this is the content of these accounts 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.799
 list of files and groups in an orderly way 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.220
 while here we see the contents of 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.439
 what these of these select 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.250
 directly that actually not only by mere 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.610
 reactors are two more these others 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.850
 The sections we will see later much 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.600
 important are the zip files that is in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.460
 interface been interface builder 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.720
 program that is always part of the kit 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.550
 be the change kondh that allows us to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.210
 configure the interface display 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.520
 graphics before making any kind of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.900
 about names we immediately find to make bill 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.040
 the iPhone will start up 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.390
 simulation and would have an application 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.690
 empty through I consider myself and i 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.760
 certificates made with account from 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.560
 developer for the apple 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.690
 we could also install ours 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.160
 application so we could install it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:03:02.110
 only if we have an account of those a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.540
 payment for developers then 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.930
 Meanwhile, use the iphone simona 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 day we make the stop
