00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.170
 Welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 my name is greta silver and here 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 I'll tell you something about a breakfast 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 I am part of the update program 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.940
 Actually, live a bit after the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.680
 As far as possible no carbohydrates 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.090
 but that does not refer to that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.519
 breakfast because that actually exists 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 only from carbohydrates and that do 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 I kind of like this myself 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.239
 It's about oatmeal and dry 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.649
 I will pack the recipe afterwards 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.840
 down underneath in the infobox and 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.210
 have thus palette throughout this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 taken from the b vitamins and to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.399
 folic acid and vitamin e and k i will 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.289
 that does not make it so detailed 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.960
 I can also have it myself 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 just after beaten what's in there 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 It contains potassium calcium magnesium 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.500
 phosphorus iron and all these things 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.619
 These are incredibly important for the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.930
 body and then I grab it too 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 mantle edged the much earlier even 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.530
 not that is the underground tuber 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.869
 of the mantle of the grass that's what it means 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.909
 is really sweet as almonds I am yes 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 so much for the sweet too 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.670
 have and round that at all possible 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.100
 I corner the sugar goes completely and that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
 that's something else as well 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.310
 is like vitamin e and the free ones 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.870
 radical curbs and is also good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 for the stabilization of blood vessels 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.270
 something and everything can do that too 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.730
 nut allergy because it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.290
 just not from the bus stand but 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.440
 something is completely different and still 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.610
 has this nutty taste and then 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.260
 I pack this amaranth that's called 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.320
 also the power grain 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.450
 that is as small as coming 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.150
 a mustard seed would actually have to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.980
 otherwise be cooked before to good 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.680
 to be digestible and it exists in the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.880
 so called tested version there will be 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.280
 then a little bit bigger like popcorn say 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.910
 I even see it then only much much 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.310
 smaller 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.320
 that's how you have to imagine that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.060
 but no real grain has everything 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.730
 others what up there the oatmeal 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.350
 and heard flakes too but did have 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.600
 significantly less carbohydrates and 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.370
 contains still all is tell 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.930
 amino acids I have to do it once 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.650
 read a bit of my lathi 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 and he mends a lot 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.220
 greater protein content ie protein content 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.400
 who has always been so important to us 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.930
 the omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.320
 The body can not produce itself 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.239
 and have these amino acids here 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.530
 The following are included 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:01.010
 described it sits that or if one 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.870
 the valuable thing you do to the body 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.670
 compares to the alphabet 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.650
 then he would not have to be 200 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.519
 letters 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.650
 but perhaps only ten times that he 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.379
 will not be able to build many words though 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.129
 he has so little available there 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:24.569
 are as building blocks as valuable 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.709
 everyone appreciates these others 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.420
 to be able to process in the body otherwise 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.500
 they just go through and that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.689
 body has none of it 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 So that's also on the edge 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:37.450
 contain and lysine for healthy skin and 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.489
 bone 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 one also writes against cancer 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.599
 I do not know that exactly 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.849
 is certainly healthy food 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.329
 Generally a good factor I know 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.650
 but not at all and how straight 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.930
 already said I always need one 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.900
 little sweet and I sweet with the whole 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.819
 Cash flow has to be 100% 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.120
 percent from this boiler 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.519
 This must and has been manufactured 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.069
 again the vitamin b and d so vitamin 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.299
 b complex or vitamin e and amino acids 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.379
 So it's something else again 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:13.510
 healthy and then pack it together with 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.400
 almonds like me and I want the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.160
 me a little almond milk so 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.709
 both are sweet and abstain 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.740
 in contrast to cow milk no 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.300
 cholesterol that is also for many 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.699
 calcium is an important topic anyway 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.300
 Supplier and because the port will be there 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.970
 also added again in which almost the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.690
 I can buy the whole thing in the shop 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.400
 drugstore purchase up to mantle 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.349
 and cashflows for that I go into 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.750
 reformhaus but otherwise I get 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:52.480
 quite normal 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:55.060
 drogeriemÃ¤rkten here and that would be me 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.340
 Although a bit on but it should 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.610
 really do not cook because then so much 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.470
 valuable lost again but so 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.510
 a very small assumption is already 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.060
 very nice and I leave it that way 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.760
 For a long time I call that the source 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.410
 something that does not have to be that way 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.240
 long until I make an apple small 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.340
 cut into my bowl and 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.450
 then I'll catch that up there and that 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.500
 is my breakfast so quantity 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.050
 now that I think so 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.830
 that does not necessarily have to decrease straight 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.170
 the more we are both about 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.830
 a tablespoon of each of 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.200
 oatmeal autumn curls and amaranth 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.450
 these are these four ingredients and 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.280
 then the sweet with the with the 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.930
 nets pattern it is only then again 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.320
 half a tablespoon I add to it 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.600
 and that tastes incredibly good to me 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.000
 I used to have this whole with g4 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.400
 wanted so cold then from the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.760
 Refrigerator which I like 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.980
 but I like this version 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.290
 now more and that means yes I want 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.060
 like to know what I have to me 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.930
 I suppose that's what I wanted to do here 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.230
 happy times and now a lot of fun 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.230
 there
