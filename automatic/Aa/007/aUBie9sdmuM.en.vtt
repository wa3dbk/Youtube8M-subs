Jordan<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> understand<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.830> worked

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
Jordan now I understand that you worked

Jordan now I understand that you worked
on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.550> infiltrator<00:00:21.210> tech<00:00:21.510> demo<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.109> epic

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
on the infiltrator tech demo that epic

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
on the infiltrator tech demo that epic
released<00:00:22.800> earlier<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.279> year<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.210> talk

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
released earlier this year can you talk

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
released earlier this year can you talk
to<00:00:24.630> us<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.810> little<00:00:24.840> bit<00:00:25.109> about<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> sure

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to us a little bit about that sure

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
to us a little bit about that sure
so<00:00:26.099> infiltrator<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> real-time<00:00:27.449> tech

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
so infiltrator is a real-time tech

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
so infiltrator is a real-time tech
demonstration<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.949> use<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> show<00:00:29.429> off

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
demonstration that we use to show off

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.569 
demonstration that we use to show off
the<00:00:29.910> capabilities<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.990> Unreal<00:00:31.260> Engine<00:00:31.289> 4<00:00:31.579> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the capabilities of Unreal Engine 4 in

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
the capabilities of Unreal Engine 4 in
it<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.090> high<00:00:33.780> dynamic<00:00:34.230> range

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it we have high dynamic range

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.810 
it we have high dynamic range
reflections<00:00:35.329> GPU<00:00:36.329> particles<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:37.079> collision

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
reflections GPU particles with collision

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.069 
reflections GPU particles with collision
material<00:00:38.820> layers<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.390> well<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.750> many<00:00:39.930> more

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
material layers as well as many more

features

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.830 

now<00:00:46.340> if<00:00:46.430> I<00:00:46.520> recall<00:00:46.640> correctly<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.420> use<00:00:47.630> the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
now if I recall correctly you use the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200 
now if I recall correctly you use the
new<00:00:47.960> material<00:00:48.470> system<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:49.190> help<00:00:49.610> define<00:00:50.150> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
new material system to help define the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.240 
new material system to help define the
look<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.170> feel<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.650> characters<00:00:52.100> and

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
look in the feel of the characters and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.770 
look in the feel of the characters and
infiltrator<00:00:52.700> that's<00:00:53.300> correct<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:53.750> a

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
infiltrator that's correct so a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.910 
infiltrator that's correct so a
character<00:00:53.990> artist<00:00:54.380> would<00:00:54.470> hand<00:00:54.740> me<00:00:54.830> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
character artist would hand me a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.560 
character artist would hand me a
character<00:00:55.340> model<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:55.880> I<00:00:56.090> would<00:00:56.270> create

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
character model and I would create

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.200 
character model and I would create
material<00:00:57.020> layers<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.680> textures<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.370> define

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
material layers and textures to define

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.600 
material layers and textures to define
how<00:00:59.600> those<00:00:59.810> surfaces<00:01:00.350> react<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.830> light<00:01:01.010> okay

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
how those surfaces react to light okay

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.800 
how those surfaces react to light okay
and<00:01:01.880> we're<00:01:02.030> gonna<00:01:02.090> be<00:01:02.300> seeing<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.570> little<00:01:02.690> bit

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
and we're gonna be seeing a little bit

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.030 
and we're gonna be seeing a little bit
of<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.080> today<00:01:03.230> that's<00:01:03.710> correct

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
of that today that's correct

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.460 
of that today that's correct
awesome<00:01:04.520> so<00:01:05.150> why<00:01:05.600> don't<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:05.810> start<00:01:06.080> by<00:01:06.230> taking

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
awesome so why don't we start by taking

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.170 
awesome so why don't we start by taking
one<00:01:06.800> of<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.950> characters<00:01:07.400> from<00:01:07.430> infiltrator

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
one of the characters from infiltrator

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 
one of the characters from infiltrator
and<00:01:08.510> kind<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.750> how<00:01:08.960> he<00:01:09.020> looked<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.590> final

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
and kind of how he looked in the final

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.740 
and kind of how he looked in the final
cinematic<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.390> can<00:01:11.540> break<00:01:11.720> down

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
cinematic and then you can break down

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.840 
cinematic and then you can break down
how<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.200> were<00:01:12.410> able<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.680> achieve<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.580> look

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
how you were able to achieve that look

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.830 
how you were able to achieve that look
using<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.540> tools<00:01:14.750> in<00:01:14.870> Unreal<00:01:15.170> Engine<00:01:15.230> 4<00:01:15.440> sure

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
using the tools in Unreal Engine 4 sure

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.690 
using the tools in Unreal Engine 4 sure
so<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.590> character<00:01:18.979> as<00:01:19.220> he<00:01:19.400> appears

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
so this is the character as he appears

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.780 
so this is the character as he appears
in<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.180> demo<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:21.350> can<00:01:21.710> see<00:01:21.979> he<00:01:22.160> has<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.460> couple

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
in the demo you can see he has a couple

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.880 
in the demo you can see he has a couple
different<00:01:23.060> surfaces<00:01:23.510> there's<00:01:23.930> some<00:01:24.590> chrome

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
different surfaces there's some chrome

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.340 
different surfaces there's some chrome
buckle<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.670> there's<00:01:26.150> like<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.960> military

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
buckle here there's like a military

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.050 
buckle here there's like a military
fabric<00:01:28.040> stretched<00:01:28.369> across<00:01:28.520> his<00:01:28.790> chest

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
fabric stretched across his chest

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.540 
fabric stretched across his chest
there's<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.050> padded<00:01:30.500> fabric<00:01:30.920> down<00:01:31.040> below<00:01:31.369> as

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
there's this padded fabric down below as

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.080 
there's this padded fabric down below as
well<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.990> as<00:01:33.229> far<00:01:33.410> as<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.770> workflow<00:01:34.369> goes<00:01:34.610> we

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
well and as far as the workflow goes we

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330 
well and as far as the workflow goes we
would<00:01:35.390> start<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.860> same<00:01:37.009> way<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.160> would

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
would start this the same way we would

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
would start this the same way we would
start<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.640> character<00:01:37.970> before<00:01:38.300> so<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:39.110> character

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
start a character before so a character

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.969 
start a character before so a character
artist<00:01:39.619> would<00:01:39.890> create<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.400> high<00:01:40.580> polygon<00:01:40.970> model

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
artist would create a high polygon model

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.499 
artist would create a high polygon model
they<00:01:42.979> would<00:01:43.220> process<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.759> normal<00:01:44.180> map<00:01:44.300> from

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
they would process a normal map from

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.730 
they would process a normal map from
that<00:01:44.690> model<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.140> hand<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.440> off<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
that model and hand that off to a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.990 
that model and hand that off to a
texture<00:01:46.100> artists

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
texture artists

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.760 
texture artists
what's<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.690> texture<00:01:47.990> artist<00:01:48.080> received<00:01:48.619> that

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
what's the texture artist received that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.550 
what's the texture artist received that
asset<00:01:49.190> they<00:01:49.789> would<00:01:50.000> create<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.810> few<00:01:51.200> different

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
asset they would create a few different

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.609 
asset they would create a few different
textures<00:01:52.330> one<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.450> them<00:01:53.600> being<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:54.229> material

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
textures one of them being a material

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.520 
textures one of them being a material
mask<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.610> kind<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.390> color<00:01:56.660> codes<00:01:56.960> where<00:01:57.259> each

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
mask that kind of color codes where each

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.340 
mask that kind of color codes where each
material<00:01:58.190> goes<00:01:58.399> on<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.000> surface<00:01:59.390> now<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.140> this

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
material goes on the surface now in this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.749 
material goes on the surface now in this
case<00:02:00.560> when<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.770> say<00:02:01.039> where<00:02:01.369> each<00:02:01.520> material

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
case when you say where each material

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.249 
case when you say where each material
goes<00:02:02.210> are<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.390> talking<00:02:02.780> about<00:02:02.899> like<00:02:03.050> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
goes are you talking about like the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.840 
goes are you talking about like the
different<00:02:03.590> types<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.920> surfaces<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:04.460> make<00:02:04.729> up

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
different types of surfaces that make up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.090 
different types of surfaces that make up
the<00:02:04.970> character<00:02:05.330> right<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.110> here<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.649> can<00:02:06.890> see

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
the character right so here you can see

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.480 
the character right so here you can see
they<00:02:07.729> colored<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.780> where<00:02:09.050> metal<00:02:09.710> goes<00:02:10.069> on<00:02:10.310> his

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
they colored in where metal goes on his

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.910 
they colored in where metal goes on his
mask<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.030> then<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:11.960> they've<00:02:12.470> colored

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
mask and then down here they've colored

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.390 
mask and then down here they've colored
where<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.990> fabric<00:02:15.200> padding<00:02:15.770> goes<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
where like the fabric padding goes and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.000 
where like the fabric padding goes and
where<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.610> black<00:02:16.760> plastic<00:02:17.390> goes<00:02:17.540> okay<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.800> it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
where the black plastic goes okay so it

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500 
where the black plastic goes okay so it
literally<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.490> color<00:02:19.730> coding<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.120> different

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
literally is color coding the different

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.880 
literally is color coding the different
types<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.870> surfaces<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.350> make<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.770> out

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
types of surfaces that make them out

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.670 
types of surfaces that make them out
exactly<00:02:22.610> alright<00:02:22.819> cool

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
exactly alright cool

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.930 
exactly alright cool
here<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.770> can<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.190> artist<00:02:25.490> creates<00:02:25.790> an

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
here you can see the artist creates an

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.600 
here you can see the artist creates an
asset<00:02:26.300> that's<00:02:26.770> basically<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.890> texture<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
asset that's basically a texture that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.510 
asset that's basically a texture that
defines<00:02:28.910> where<00:02:29.450> grime<00:02:30.380> resides<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
defines where grime resides on the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.670 
defines where grime resides on the
surface<00:02:31.910> where<00:02:32.180> dirt<00:02:32.480> collects<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.560> see

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
surface where dirt collects you can see

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.100 
surface where dirt collects you can see
in<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> cracks<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.400> things<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.569> texture<00:02:36.050> is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
in the cracks of things this texture is

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.010 
in the cracks of things this texture is
a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:36.380> heavier<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.370> basically<00:02:37.670> saying

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
a lot heavier and it's basically saying

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.470 
a lot heavier and it's basically saying
this<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.230> where<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.560> surface<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.069> dirty

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
this is where the surface is dirty

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.059 
this is where the surface is dirty
this<00:02:41.810> final<00:02:42.140> texture<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.650> an<00:02:42.770> artist

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
this final texture that an artist

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.840 
this final texture that an artist
creates<00:02:43.959> says<00:02:44.959> where<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> scratches<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
creates says where the scratches and the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
creates says where the scratches and the
scuff<00:02:47.090> marks<00:02:47.120> happen<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:49.040> would<00:02:49.190> do

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
scuff marks happen and they would do

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.250 
scuff marks happen and they would do
that<00:02:49.490> on<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> edges<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.209> objects<00:02:50.630> they<00:02:50.930> do<00:02:50.990> it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that on the edges of objects they do it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.500 
that on the edges of objects they do it
where<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.739> surface<00:02:52.280> may<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.730> rubs<00:02:53.090> against

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
where a surface may be like rubs against

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.260 
where a surface may be like rubs against
other<00:02:53.689> thing

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
other thing

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.080 
other thing
so<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.440> an<00:02:55.560> example<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.580> variant<00:02:57.060> that

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
so this is an example of a variant that

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.780 
so this is an example of a variant that
we<00:02:57.300> made<00:02:57.510> where<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.290> took<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.370> one<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
we made where I took just one of the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.910 
we made where I took just one of the
layers<00:03:00.000> which<00:03:00.420> was<00:03:00.630> composite<00:03:01.170> plastic<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
layers which was composite plastic and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.030 
layers which was composite plastic and
said<00:03:02.340> now<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.930> orangie<00:03:04.590> copper

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
said now it's this like orangie copper

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.020 
said now it's this like orangie copper
metal<00:03:05.550> color<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.860> used<00:03:08.580> all<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
metal color and that used all of the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.910 
metal color and that used all of the
same<00:03:09.210> textures<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.960> created<00:03:10.350> before<00:03:10.440> I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
same textures that we created before I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.580 
same textures that we created before I
just<00:03:11.580> swapped<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.330> material<00:03:13.020> layer<00:03:13.170> yeah

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
just swapped out one material layer yeah

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.750 
just swapped out one material layer yeah
and<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.770> touch<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.070> color<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:14.610> looks

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and the touch of color actually looks

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.360 
and the touch of color actually looks
really<00:03:14.820> amazing<00:03:15.180> they're<00:03:15.570> very<00:03:16.200> nice<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:17.070> in

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
really amazing they're very nice now in

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.880 
really amazing they're very nice now in
the<00:03:17.610> infiltrator<00:03:18.210> demo<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.170> actually<00:03:19.590> used<00:03:19.770> a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
the infiltrator demo you actually used a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.010 
the infiltrator demo you actually used a
combination<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.060> traditional<00:03:21.750> approach

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
combination of the traditional approach

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.300 
combination of the traditional approach
along<00:03:22.320> with<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.500> incorporation<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.160> these

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
along with the incorporation of these

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.830 
along with the incorporation of these
layered<00:03:23.550> materials<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.480> talk<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> bit

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
layered materials can you talk a bit

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
layered materials can you talk a bit
about<00:03:24.960> how<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.290> did<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:27.000> used

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
about how you did that right so we used

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.790 
about how you did that right so we used
a<00:03:27.390> traditional<00:03:27.540> approach<00:03:27.960> to<00:03:28.200> create<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
a traditional approach to create the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.350 
a traditional approach to create the
material<00:03:29.160> layers<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.670> an<00:03:29.760> artist<00:03:30.060> will<00:03:30.180> create

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
material layers so an artist will create

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.290 
material layers so an artist will create
a<00:03:30.570> tiling<00:03:30.960> base<00:03:31.380> color<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:32.040> tiling<00:03:32.490> roughness

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
a tiling base color a tiling roughness

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.420 
a tiling base color a tiling roughness
texture<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.230> tiling<00:03:34.590> normal<00:03:34.860> map<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.250> same

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
texture and a tiling normal map the same

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.430 
texture and a tiling normal map the same
way<00:03:35.580> they<00:03:35.730> would<00:03:35.880> before<00:03:36.060> they<00:03:36.900> make<00:03:37.290> that

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
way they would before they make that

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.070 
way they would before they make that
material<00:03:37.860> layer<00:03:38.010> look<00:03:38.550> good<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.810> they

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
material layer look good and then they

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.750 
material layer look good and then they
use<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.500> new<00:03:40.680> techniques<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.370> material

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
use the new techniques of material

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.310 
use the new techniques of material
layers<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.210> combine<00:03:42.510> all<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.870> those<00:03:43.080> together

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
layers to combine all of those together

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.500 
layers to combine all of those together
and<00:03:43.980> they<00:03:44.700> still<00:03:45.000> use<00:03:45.240> traditional

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
and they still use traditional

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.420 
and they still use traditional
techniques<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.470> create<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.890> masks<00:03:47.370> right

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
techniques to create the masks right

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.220 
techniques to create the masks right
like<00:03:47.790> those<00:03:48.000> are<00:03:48.150> created<00:03:48.300> using<00:03:48.600> Photoshop

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
like those are created using Photoshop

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.890 
like those are created using Photoshop
or<00:03:49.500> 3d<00:03:49.800> paint<00:03:50.010> programs<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:51.120> blend<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
or 3d paint programs to blend the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840 
or 3d paint programs to blend the
material<00:03:52.260> layers<00:03:52.410> together<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.490> how<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.700> you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
material layers together so how do you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.970 
material layers together so how do you
benefit<00:03:54.270> from<00:03:54.450> using<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:55.080> hybrid<00:03:55.560> technique

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
benefit from using this hybrid technique

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.890 
benefit from using this hybrid technique
so<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.670> get<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.910> benefits<00:03:57.300> from<00:03:57.420> material

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so you get the benefits from material

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.450 
so you get the benefits from material
layers<00:03:58.080> which<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.740> really<00:03:59.010> high-resolution

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
layers which is a really high-resolution

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.540 
layers which is a really high-resolution
tiling<00:04:00.450> material<00:04:01.250> combined<00:04:02.250> with<00:04:02.460> the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
tiling material combined with the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.430 
tiling material combined with the
benefits<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.120> traditional<00:04:03.330> techniques<00:04:04.080> where

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
benefits of traditional techniques where

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.530 
benefits of traditional techniques where
an<00:04:04.470> artist<00:04:04.740> is<00:04:05.070> saying<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.970> know<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.270> want<00:04:06.300> a

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
an artist is saying you know I want a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.760 
an artist is saying you know I want a
scuff<00:04:06.840> mark<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.320> his<00:04:07.560> shoulder<00:04:07.950> pad<00:04:08.160> or<00:04:08.460> I<00:04:08.520> want

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
scuff mark on his shoulder pad or I want

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.460 
scuff mark on his shoulder pad or I want
copper<00:04:10.770> on<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:11.550> part<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.940> his<00:04:12.060> body<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.690> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
copper on this part of his body and so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.740 
copper on this part of his body and so
you're<00:04:13.950> allowed<00:04:14.190> custom<00:04:15.000> surface

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
you're allowed custom surface

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.780 
you're allowed custom surface
information<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.310> still<00:04:17.489> looks<00:04:17.640> really

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
information but it still looks really

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.930 
information but it still looks really
high-resolution<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:19.310> highly<00:04:20.310> detailed

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.030 

so<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.690> understand<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.350> Unreal<00:04:28.710> Engine<00:04:28.830> 4

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so I understand that Unreal Engine 4

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.400 
so I understand that Unreal Engine 4
uses<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> physically<00:04:30.420> based<00:04:30.570> shading<00:04:31.080> model

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
uses a physically based shading model

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.860 
uses a physically based shading model
why<00:04:32.160> does<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.370> matter<00:04:32.670> here<00:04:33.000> it's<00:04:33.660> nice

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
why does that matter here it's nice

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.660 
why does that matter here it's nice
because<00:04:34.110> when<00:04:34.740> an<00:04:34.860> artist<00:04:35.250> creates<00:04:35.610> a

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
because when an artist creates a

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.550 
because when an artist creates a
material<00:04:36.060> layer<00:04:36.240> they<00:04:36.870> know<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.290> it's<00:04:37.470> going

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
material layer they know that it's going

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
material layer they know that it's going
to<00:04:37.680> react<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.070> light<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.610> consistent<00:04:39.120> manner

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
to react to light in a consistent manner

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.750 
to react to light in a consistent manner
no<00:04:39.990> matter<00:04:40.170> what<00:04:40.830> lighting<00:04:41.250> condition<00:04:41.640> is

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
no matter what lighting condition is

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.180 
no matter what lighting condition is
placed<00:04:42.060> in<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:43.410> keeps<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> artist<00:04:44.070> from

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
placed in this keeps the artist from

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.550 
placed in this keeps the artist from
having<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.670> tweak<00:04:45.060> their<00:04:45.540> surface<00:04:46.080> for

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
having to tweak their surface for

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.370 
having to tweak their surface for
individual<00:04:47.100> lighting<00:04:47.400> conditions<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.870> as<00:04:49.110> an

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
individual lighting conditions so as an

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.800 
individual lighting conditions so as an
artist<00:04:49.590> yourself<00:04:50.250> what<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.420> you<00:04:51.600> want

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
artist yourself what is it that you want

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.320 
artist yourself what is it that you want
other<00:04:52.020> artists<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.740> designers<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.730> take<00:04:54.150> away

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
other artists and designers to take away

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.690 
other artists and designers to take away
from<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.660> one<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.740> really<00:04:56.070> cool<00:04:56.220> aspects

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
from this one of the really cool aspects

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.030 
from this one of the really cool aspects
is<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:57.900> very<00:04:58.020> easy<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.740> make

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
is that it's very easy to make

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.860 
is that it's very easy to make
consistent<00:04:59.490> art<00:04:59.940> across<00:05:00.570> your<00:05:00.780> entire

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
consistent art across your entire

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.590 
consistent art across your entire
project<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.580> make<00:05:02.760> your<00:05:02.880> metals<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.450> make

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
project so you make your metals you make

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.630 
project so you make your metals you make
your<00:05:03.720> cloth<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.800> create<00:05:05.100> your<00:05:05.220> materials

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
your cloth you create your materials

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.890 
your cloth you create your materials
that<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.880> know<00:05:06.000> you're<00:05:06.150> gonna<00:05:06.240> use<00:05:06.660> and

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
that you know you're gonna use and

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.450 
that you know you're gonna use and
wherever<00:05:07.140> they're<00:05:07.380> used<00:05:07.620> in<00:05:07.800> your<00:05:07.950> project

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
wherever they're used in your project

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.010 
wherever they're used in your project
you<00:05:08.640> know<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.180> they're<00:05:09.330> consistent<00:05:09.630> and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
you know that they're consistent and

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.380 
you know that they're consistent and
they're<00:05:10.170> high-quality<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:11.210> it's<00:05:12.210> also

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
they're high-quality and it's also

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.300 
they're high-quality and it's also
useful<00:05:12.720> because<00:05:13.290> you<00:05:13.770> know<00:05:13.860> say<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.130> have

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
useful because you know say you have

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.010 
useful because you know say you have
this<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:14.730> paint<00:05:15.030> that's<00:05:15.270> used<00:05:15.510> in<00:05:15.660> your<00:05:15.780> game

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
this like paint that's used in your game

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540 
this like paint that's used in your game
and<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.590> have<00:05:16.680> an<00:05:16.770> art<00:05:16.890> director<00:05:16.980> who<00:05:17.340> says

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
and you have an art director who says

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.090 
and you have an art director who says
you<00:05:18.090> know<00:05:18.210> could<00:05:18.450> we<00:05:18.480> make<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:19.100> slightly

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
you know could we make that slightly

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.730 
you know could we make that slightly
more<00:05:20.280> blue<00:05:20.570> you<00:05:21.570> cannot<00:05:21.810> update<00:05:22.200> that<00:05:22.560> one

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
more blue you cannot update that one

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.380 
more blue you cannot update that one
asset<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.400> since<00:05:23.670> it's<00:05:23.790> used<00:05:23.970> across<00:05:24.210> your

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
asset and since it's used across your

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.270 
asset and since it's used across your
entire<00:05:24.450> game<00:05:24.990> everything<00:05:25.830> updates

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
entire game everything updates

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.370 
entire game everything updates
automatically<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.750> there's<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:28.020> look<00:05:28.170> at

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
automatically so there's a look at

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.740 
automatically so there's a look at
creating<00:05:28.560> highly<00:05:29.400> detailed<00:05:29.750> character

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
creating highly detailed character

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.840
