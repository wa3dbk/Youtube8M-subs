 of our work never in any 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.820
 moment according to the president mauricio 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.010
 You operate the farm located in the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.050
 canton naranjito was awarded by the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.260
 list to the cooperative at a price of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.660
 570 thousand dollars in April 2009 but 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.310
 only the tenth part was canceled a bit 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.490
 more than $ 57,000 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.650
 taking advantage of the benefit of prompt payment 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 established in the legislative decree 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.369
 263 that was created to facilitate the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 cancellation of the agrarian debt but 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.170
 according to the legal adviser of the cooperative 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.360
 the process was completely legal if not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 we would have applied who comes to whom 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.130
 the tie would have been thrown to make us 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 all of that in fact the structure of this 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.170
 well this is a script of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 Constitution 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.390
 because it 's all the department of 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.240
 associations did not help him elaborate or 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.760
 be we little by little we did it and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.010
 this is the writing the testimony of the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.000
 writing where where he enrolled in the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.650
 cmr and oscar oliver tells me the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.960
 President also said that said 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.399
 cooperative was an association and changed 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.740
 your name in order to access the benefit 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.150
 suddenly payment also considers 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.340
 suspect that the endorsement to do the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.890
 change of legal personality occurred in 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 record time so but first god 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.560
 that the prosecutor orders me to call 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.340
 right now before the elections are 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.440
 because we have everything 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.170
 clear from those moments of 2003 to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.849
 now that the fmln people have always 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.640
 been against us 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.500
 we benefit the humble people the farm 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.420
 is administered by ex-patrollers and their 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.069
 families who consider having everything 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 the right to be benefited 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.519
 we are former patrollers 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.980
 patrollers then and there was a decree 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.910
 that here patrollers could deliver 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.950
 your coffee piece of coffee or earth to 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.590
 that work then we like 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.599
 we were benefited and I the president 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.360
 I will say look with the same stick that 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.590
 is measuring me one day they will measure it 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.540
 the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.799
 and with a fourth of more 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.780
 and he knows he has a glass roof 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.590
 digital is being left for news 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.590
