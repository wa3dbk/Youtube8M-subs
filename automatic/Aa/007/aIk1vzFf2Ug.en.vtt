00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.269
 what are you doing soap no us 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.810
 no butter on your hands with it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.810
 the perfect traction has made her that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 it is not normal that hello 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 that's exactly what I'm mastic 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.029
 Welcome to a new video today 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 there is again a new edition of the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.920
 camps week how are at the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 third video and today there is a dmr 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.070
 as a weapon this is the m3 28 you have her 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 a show with the whole perks 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 put on and other stuff and yes what 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.180
 is a gmr he should be the link 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 between assault rifle and 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 sniper rifle man had in the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 For example, previous cod always share 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.520
 at the snipers the mk always had him 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.309
 has made a lot of small shot 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.230
 or stop at the storm rifles the fvl 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.640
 the halt also semi-automatic were rather 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 a little bit better for the distance 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 true and now they have evolved 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 we put the whole in a class 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 the whole semi-automatic fvl clown 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 and the mkv thomilla semi-automatic 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.439
 snipers part weapons say I am 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 nothing new is nice but me 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
 must say, in part , the weapons 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 just this m3 28 really strong so if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.200
 one has good aiming whereby I note 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.360
 I need a gameplay all the way 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.189
 I did not live well at all 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 really quite often united why so 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.229
 Yes, I'll say that right away 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 important, of course, is still sound 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 but you can really do it pretty well 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.170
 leave with it and we play here 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.579
 just free for everyone on freight shows 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.650
 anyway that's the snow card 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.869
 with the freight trains and if now grad 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
 are at uniting and I think snow 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.430
 snow is rather cold and at the moment 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 honestly it is also cold in Germany 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 So that 's me for the last few 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.170
 days we noticed now 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 Somehow every day now that's how one is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.350
 almost had in the morning and that has me 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.750
 Query a bit if I am 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.119
 for example, to go to school 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.930
 or so and me was already general 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.969
 pretty cold and with me it is so and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.600
 now somehow properly on theme 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.500
 come 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.390
 I also had the gameplay cold 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.040
 the end and now you can follow more often 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.840
 Home the hands are cold I always have to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.310
 the heating on because it is with me 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.920
 it so and I do not know if I am one 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.980
 I am single case but I can somehow 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.110
 only play with warm hands so play 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.030
 when the cell phone really cozy warm 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.060
 i can give you time i can play 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.050
 take money and otherwise developed 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.030
 I do not know how to feel 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.550
 just so plaintiffs what I a bit 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.840
 think stupid and maybe I'm one 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.190
 but I already have some 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.020
 People are asking for opinions 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.880
 really different some people 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.400
 it does not matter to others 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.140
 possibly strive for the same as me 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.510
 that they are always really nice and warm 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.310
 years that sometimes even into the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.340
 swiss pass that, so to speak 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.800
 which has perfect grip on the controller 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 and yes, you can really be smart 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.970
 I would say mine and also 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.230
 generally you do not find that too 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.940
 somehow winter this year pretty much 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.860
 I'll have my last year early 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.930
 we are still a christmas yes me 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.700
 think nice 15 degrees you could 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.350
 so to speak, a short things out 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.670
 go and meanwhile it is already 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.870
 pretty cold who knows 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.620
 maybe the whole thing will change 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.880
 and a thing on the subject short thing I 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.390
 I have one at school the other day 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.080
 seen 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.239
 that's in a short pants and t-shirt 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.610
 gone school I thought so old 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.799
 thick it is not cold because I think 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.330
 it's a bit extreme me 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.730
 I do not know because I had a bet 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.040
 lost or so because I mean in now 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.630
 short things to go to school 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.600
 pretty blatant but maybe he is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.739
 one of you as hard as he does that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.810
 I would of course be interested 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.510
 also the thing here with the hands like 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.000
 She prefers to play here with white 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.340
 shirts warm hands or rather it is 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.380
 okay with cold hands and yes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.060
 otherwise there is not really 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.760
 More so much to say it's a good one 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.709
 Weapon I can keep everyone's heart 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.870
 put in the melee, it is indeed on distance 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.150
 is also pretty nice and easy 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.290
 You have to trigger one quickly 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.420
 needs a real trigger finger 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.720
 I say for the weapon and quite 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.520
 fast typing and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.600
 you could even be a rapid 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.120
 buy fire controller, there are the parts 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.250
 Actually, I do not even know me 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.780
 I 've never seen one before 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.630
 player who has used one 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.110
 but I mean if you practice you can really 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.300
 well with the controller fingers so one 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 just finger the shot very fast 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.200
 Taste and then you really get everyone 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.780
 opponent thumbs because I have a shot 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.490
 long of hatchet 2 stop in the body 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.680
 and then it's already gone and straight 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.330
 because you die too much in glass or something 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.070
 This is not really fast dying 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.140
 problem I say 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.340
 well what the video now I hope 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.840
 of course you liked it now 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.360
 the last episode again 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.920
 linked and he people I hope like 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.650
 said you liked it 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.650
 until next time people and adios
