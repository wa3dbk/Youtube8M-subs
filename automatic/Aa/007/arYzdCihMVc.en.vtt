00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
all right they're just going to make a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.440 
all right they're just going to make a
review<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.669> my<00:00:03.330> car<00:00:03.750> Asia<00:00:04.740> lights<00:00:05.160> for<00:00:05.640> BMW<00:00:06.980> and

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
review of my car Asia lights for BMW and

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.089 
review of my car Asia lights for BMW and
this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:09.690> they<00:00:09.809> look<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:10.110> they're<00:00:10.500> LEDs

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
this is how they look like they're LEDs

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.150 
this is how they look like they're LEDs
and<00:00:12.049> there's<00:00:13.049> supposed<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.559> two<00:00:13.620> brightest

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and there's supposed to be two brightest

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.230 
and there's supposed to be two brightest
one<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.549> market<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.090> going

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
one of the market and we're just going

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
one of the market and we're just going
to<00:00:18.439> put<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.340> we're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
to put them on and then we're going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.679 
to put them on and then we're going to
show<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:20.970> they<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.600> we're

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
show you how they look like and we're

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.080 
show you how they look like and we're
going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> compare<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.590> other<00:00:23.100> LEDs<00:00:23.789> no

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
going to compare it with other LEDs no

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.580 
going to compare it with other LEDs no
other<00:00:24.810> angel<00:00:25.260> lights<00:00:27.260> i'll<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> one

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
other angel lights i'll be the one

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
other angel lights i'll be the one
installing<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.199> putting<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.289> babies

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
installing them and putting these babies

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.729 
installing them and putting these babies
of<00:00:31.710> Tom<00:00:31.920> will<00:00:32.399> compare<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> ccfl<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.899> LEDs

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
of Tom will compare the ccfl to the LEDs

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.700 
of Tom will compare the ccfl to the LEDs
which<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> cci<00:00:35.640> files<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.030> car<00:00:36.710> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
which I have the cci files in my car and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.030 
which I have the cci files in my car and
go<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> tell<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.890> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
go from there and tell you which one is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.209 
go from there and tell you which one is
the<00:00:41.160> best<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.700> purchase<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> price

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the best to purchase and for the price

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
the best to purchase and for the price
how<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.910> looking<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.210> far<00:00:45.390> look<00:00:46.379> good

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
how is it looking so far look good

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.150 
how is it looking so far look good
everything's<00:00:46.980> intact<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
everything's intact and also the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
everything's intact and also the
different<00:00:50.550> thing<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> LEDs<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> if

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
different thing with the LEDs that if

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.790 
different thing with the LEDs that if
they<00:00:52.260> ship<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:53.059> they<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.180> come<00:00:54.480> intact<00:00:54.870> yes

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
they ship them they will come intact yes

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
they ship them they will come intact yes
those<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.280> ones<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:57.149> could<00:00:57.329> come<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
those other ones they could come and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380 
those other ones they could come and
then<00:00:58.070> broken<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.430> had<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> couple<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
then broken I've had a couple like that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.560 
then broken I've had a couple like that
Oh<00:01:00.770> break<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.160> yeah<00:01:03.059> we're<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> try

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
Oh break so yeah we're going to try

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
Oh break so yeah we're going to try
these<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:05.100> like

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
these out and see what they look like

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:20.780 
these out and see what they look like
all<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.820> let's<00:01:06.000> check<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.820 

so<00:01:21.790> there<00:01:22.000> are<00:01:22.119> some<00:01:22.530> initialize<00:01:23.530> from

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
so there are some initialize from

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:35.480 
so there are some initialize from
earlier<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.729> was<00:01:24.880> total<00:01:25.240> crap

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.990 

alright<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:36.610> those<00:01:36.760> LEDs<00:01:37.360> they<00:01:38.050> do<00:01:38.410> not<00:01:38.440> have<00:01:38.590> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
alright so those LEDs they do not have a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.380 
alright so those LEDs they do not have a
ballast<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:46.060> are<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.300> ballast<00:01:46.720> for<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
ballast so these are the ballast for the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:00.109 
ballast so these are the ballast for the
hell<00:01:49.390> puts<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.140> headlights

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.389 

so<00:02:01.119> apparently<00:02:01.600> they<00:02:02.140> didn't<00:02:02.439> click<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:02.979> very

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
so apparently they didn't click on very

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.700 
so apparently they didn't click on very
well<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.360> there<00:02:04.630> was<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.750> bit<00:02:04.929> loosely<00:02:05.259> putting

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
well and there was a bit loosely putting

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:14.520 
well and there was a bit loosely putting
like<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:08.250> double<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:10.860> make<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.920> fit<00:02:12.280> better<00:02:13.530> it's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
like a double to make it fit better it's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.240 
like a double to make it fit better it's
also<00:02:14.709> because<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.360> original<00:02:16.420> OEM

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
also because the way the original OEM

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.280 
also because the way the original OEM
lights<00:02:18.250> will<00:02:18.700> fit<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> will<00:02:19.720> clip<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.110> them

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
lights will fit and will clip on them

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.619 
lights will fit and will clip on them
but<00:02:20.590> since<00:02:20.799> these<00:02:20.920> are<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.190> aftermarket<00:02:21.700> they

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
but since these are the aftermarket they

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.080 
but since these are the aftermarket they
will<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.950> come<00:02:24.160> deal<00:02:25.060> with

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
will not so we have to come deal with

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:37.870 
will not so we have to come deal with
that<00:02:25.450> maker<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:27.209> contraption

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.280 

so<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.030> seen<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.510> some<00:02:39.690> difficulties

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
so it's seen we have some difficulties

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
so it's seen we have some difficulties
here<00:02:41.210> attaching<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.710> one<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.370> had<00:02:44.520> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
here attaching the right one we had to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.110 
here attaching the right one we had to
use<00:02:44.640> tape<00:02:45.120> or<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.570> here<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.760> seems

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
use tape or on here and it just seems

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.430 
use tape or on here and it just seems
like<00:02:48.210> holes<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:48.780> who<00:02:49.020> knows<00:02:49.170> what's<00:02:49.350> gonna

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
like holes but who knows what's gonna

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.810 
like holes but who knows what's gonna
happen<00:02:49.770> if<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.950> heats<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> weather

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
happen if it heats up and the weather

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.670 
happen if it heats up and the weather
changes<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.780> guess<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.080> gotta<00:02:52.230> run<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.560> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
changes but I guess we gotta run with it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.370 
changes but I guess we gotta run with it
because<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> lot<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.550> options<00:02:53.940> right<00:02:54.090> now

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
because have a lot of options right now

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.490 
because have a lot of options right now
so<00:02:55.380> we'll<00:02:55.590> say

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
so we'll say

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.790 
so we'll say
you're<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.250> bit<00:02:58.580> paranoid<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.360> using<00:02:59.660> tape<00:02:59.930> so

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
you're a bit paranoid and using tape so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.200 
you're a bit paranoid and using tape so

take you thought we've got hour and a
half<00:04:13.410> two<00:04:13.650> hours<00:04:13.760> hence<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.900> OEM<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.500> would

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
half two hours hence the OEM it would

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.949 
half two hours hence the OEM it would
have<00:04:16.680> gone<00:04:16.709> faster<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.570> had<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.720> deal<00:04:18.930> with
