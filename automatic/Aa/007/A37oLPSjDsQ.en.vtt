00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.290
 merger of two sports clubs in the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.449
 in the year 2000 the berliner merged 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.910
 dance sports club and the club green gold 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.900
 with the tb was a perfect carrier 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.790
 found a club 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.100
 the history of the origins 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.430
 but goes back to the 60s 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.980
 The dance sports department here at the tb 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.119
 Of course, the turntable in Berlin has 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.229
 to offer a lot and over the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.460
 versatility when we are natural 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.869
 now entertain and for that I have 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.110
 now the woman adam at my side 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.800
 Katharina The question is how versatile 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.680
 is then actually the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.509
 dance sports department at tb crazy 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 versatile it starts that we children 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.700
 I almost want to say at the age of 45 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.680
 years to teach them 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.520
 The first steps in bringing up 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.450
 in the somewhat older age groups 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.700
 I'll say such a very willing 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.960
 60 70 year old is here as well 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.149
 represented in sports 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.820
 So cover this entire bandwidth 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.740
 verb tanzsport is extremely popular with the tbb 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.929
 successfully operated tournament winner 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.789
 national champion all can be found in the club 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.619
 you can train again completely 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.630
 classic especially the files and the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.690
 standard dance we have in all 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.130
 areas of performance sports dance groups we 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.630
 but also have a lot of sports 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.399
 So dance groups do not have to be everything 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.489
 be focused on competitive sports 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.560
 who said for normal training 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.270
 I would like to dance regularly because 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.340
 the fun of dancing is with us 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 just as well canceled tournament dancers 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 Adolescents and athletes all 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.489
 are in the idea and get 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 encouraged to dance classically 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.630
 of course women and men with each other 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.860
 the turntables are also courses 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.580
 for same-sex couples 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 offered 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.080
 just as versatile as the gymnastics community 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.030
 is also the dance sport itself im 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.230
 standard and latin each have five 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.150
 different dances 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 In addition there are many more games 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 Dancers are depending on performance level in 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.930
 different classes divided the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.000
 highest is the s-class dance in it 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.340
 also yvonne and detlef one of the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.650
 most successful couple of tb i have 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 Let me tell you 10 10 dances are there like 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.960
 versatile is the sport in general 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.240
 I would say blame saved 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.390
 actually everything very nice for a 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.190
 the coordination trained 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.020
 yes, think along with the spirit minister 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.490
 calls required at a click measure 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.270
 somehow sort each other 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.620
 he demands and promotes the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.270
 condition which is usually so playful 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.220
 looking simple is in truth one 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.080
 real high performance the body tension 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.150
 uphold and take all steps 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.640
 It takes a lot of effort to coordinate 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.020
 of course, of course, the endurance 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.620
 interaction between the partners 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.030
 vote 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.890
 until you take it to the higher classes 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.610
 creates can therefore take a long time 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.980
 to take 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.990
 transport is not for nothing like a lot 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.690
 intensive sport type of sport 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.660
 It really requires you to do that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.180
 over and over again and again 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.430
 she does the same passages with them 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.740
 someday you get that way too 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.630
 as they should be as they should be 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.310
 okay, then that's the word for me 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.930
 Try now as it should be 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.260
 and puttet try dance now 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.260
 go out 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.120
 I have to honestly say this 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.219
 self-testing, I am delighted 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.139
 especially because from now on the time is in 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.670
 the disco to stand alone at last 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.249
 over I now get even finally 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.200
 my dance instruction and that of the best 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.280
 The place of elenas is one of the 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.690
 most successful dancer and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.949
 trainers yes elena ten dances are there 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.599
 which dance can me as a beginner 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.259
 recommend where I can score points 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.630
 with the ladies 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.389
 So I would say yes we catch now 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.750
 with rumba because reconstruction is easier 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.120
 stunts and the slowest slow dance 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.550
 yes, so I say you took the step 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.970
 is working 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.789
 we step to the side, yes, we 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.120
 make a step forward 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:48.410
 and right back so again 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.570
 steps to the side is forward and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.889
 right behind it 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.690
 important is that you still have your weight 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.960
 bring to friends and then immediately 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.410
 after dinner yes again we make ourselves 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.410
 to be today 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.710
 Coordination was never my big one 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.630
 Strength 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.910
 all the more I come here to mine 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.370
 mind you at the simplest 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.740
 dance form and in a tempo over the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:32.040
 professionals can only laugh but elena 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:34.320
 proves to be a patient teacher then 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.900
 it gets serious for me now it says 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.820
 I dance together as lord but 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.150
 anything but capable of leadership 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.150
 to take over 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.320
 that's not that hard you have 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:03.800
 forget we'll do it again 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.800
 relax you let loose 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.670
 Dance slopes are not his greatest talent 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.710
 a miracle that elena ever with me 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.630
 continue alone as the step sequence 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.230
 it's hard to remember, but how 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.250
 already mentioned 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.250

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.460

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.180
