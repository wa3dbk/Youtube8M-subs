okay<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.069> rotate<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.730> back<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.450> next

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
okay I rotate to the back the next

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.570 
okay I rotate to the back the next
feature<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.049> need<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> create<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.890> little<00:00:08.309> tab

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
feature I need to create is a little tab

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.890 
feature I need to create is a little tab
that<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.880> want<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> drop<00:00:09.269> off<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.660> edge

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that we want to drop off this edge

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.010 
that we want to drop off this edge
that's<00:00:10.139> gonna<00:00:10.290> tuck<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.030> behind<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:13.009> bottom

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
that's gonna tuck in behind this bottom

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.050 
that's gonna tuck in behind this bottom
the<00:00:16.020> bottom<00:00:16.350> part<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.920> also<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:17.940> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the bottom part here I also want this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
the bottom part here I also want this
tab<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.539> goals<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
tab one of my goals is that it that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.689 
tab one of my goals is that it that
would<00:00:19.650> make<00:00:19.680> sure<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.980> pick<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.460> whole

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
would make sure we pick up this whole

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.550 
would make sure we pick up this whole
location<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.930> throw<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> fastener

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
location so we can throw a fastener

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
location so we can throw a fastener
through<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
through there to do this I'm going to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
through there to do this I'm going to
just<00:00:24.720> use<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> edge<00:00:25.350> flange<00:00:25.650> tool<00:00:25.890> again<00:00:26.160> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
just use the edge flange tool again so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580 
just use the edge flange tool again so
grab<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> edge<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.930> bring<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> down<00:00:28.260> some

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
grab the edge just bring it down some

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
grab the edge just bring it down some
distance<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:30.179> doesn't<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
distance it doesn't look much like a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.709 
distance it doesn't look much like a
little<00:00:31.199> tab<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> tuck<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.099> yet<00:00:32.279> does<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
little tab to tuck in there yet does it

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
little tab to tuck in there yet does it
but<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.120> my

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
but what we can do is over here in my

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.569 
but what we can do is over here in my
properties<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.290> there<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:38.129> say<00:00:38.340> let's

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
properties right there I can say let's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
properties right there I can say let's
edit<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> flange<00:00:39.270> profile<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.379> currently

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
edit the flange profile so currently

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
edit the flange profile so currently
it's<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.219> big<00:00:41.370> rectangle<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it's just a big rectangle you can really

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's just a big rectangle you can really
add<00:00:43.379> any<00:00:43.890> shape<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.350> also

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
add any shape you want to this also

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
add any shape you want to this also
notice<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> corner<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.570> constrained

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
notice that the corner is constrained

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.139 
notice that the corner is constrained
right<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.460> check<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
right up here but check this out if I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.729 
right up here but check this out if I
just<00:00:51.329> grab<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> drag<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.649> away

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
just grab that point and drag it away

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.080 
just grab that point and drag it away
from<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> corner<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.520> breaks<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
from the corner it breaks that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.450 
from the corner it breaks that
constraint<00:00:54.780> okay<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> little

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
constraint okay so that's a little

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
constraint okay so that's a little
shortcut<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.539> busting<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> constraint

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
shortcut to just busting that constraint

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
shortcut to just busting that constraint
out<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.539> next<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> want<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:00.960> sure

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
out of there next I want to make sure

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
out of there next I want to make sure
that<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> tab<00:01:02.430> always<00:01:03.239> fits<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> slot

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that this tab always fits in that slot

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.810 
that this tab always fits in that slot
so<00:01:04.379> I'll<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> relationship<00:01:05.670> between

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so I'll just make a relationship between

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.450 
so I'll just make a relationship between
the<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.600> geometry<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> sketch<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the the geometry and the sketch and the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.899 
the the geometry and the sketch and the
slot<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:10.770> course<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.549> thing<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
slot of course do the right thing and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.240 
slot of course do the right thing and
put<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> dimension<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:12.979> not<00:01:13.979> twelve

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
put a dimension in here not twelve

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 
put a dimension in here not twelve
should<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.350> they'll<00:01:16.350> grab<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> edge<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
should do it they'll grab the edge of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
should do it they'll grab the edge of
this<00:01:17.130> hole<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.400> we'll<00:01:17.729> convert<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> that'll

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this hole and we'll convert that that'll

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490 
this hole and we'll convert that that'll
be<00:01:19.320> void<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> material<00:01:20.570> all<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:22.350> go

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
be void of material all right let's go

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
be void of material all right let's go
back<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> look<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> preview<00:01:23.759> some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
back and have a look at the preview some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
back and have a look at the preview some
additional<00:01:24.990> work<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.350> still<00:01:25.590> need<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
additional work I still need to do on

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
additional work I still need to do on
this<00:01:26.340> thing<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.210> doesn't<00:01:27.509> sit<00:01:27.720> behind<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
this thing it doesn't sit behind the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
this thing it doesn't sit behind the
wall<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.880> bottom<00:01:30.150> part<00:01:30.329> yet<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.650> gonna

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
wall of the bottom part yet so I'm gonna

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.920 
wall of the bottom part yet so I'm gonna
come<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.119> use<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
come in here and I'm gonna use the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.020 
come in here and I'm gonna use the
offset<00:01:34.110> function<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.189> give<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.610> offset

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
offset function to give it some offset

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
offset function to give it some offset
it's<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> nice<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.840> tool<00:01:37.229> you'll<00:01:37.409> notice

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it's a nice little tool you'll notice

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039 
it's a nice little tool you'll notice
that<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.610> offsetting<00:01:39.150> from<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> edge<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that now it's offsetting from the edge I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.889 
that now it's offsetting from the edge I
want<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> make<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.799> offset<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.430> millimeter

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
want to make up offset one millimeter

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
want to make up offset one millimeter
toward<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> inside<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.880> then<00:01:44.880> make<00:01:45.030> sure

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
toward the inside and then make sure

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
toward the inside and then make sure
that<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.360> Bend<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> totally<00:01:46.140> inside<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that that Bend is totally inside the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
that that Bend is totally inside the
edge<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:48.689> should<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.970> okay

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
edge that should do it okay

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
edge that should do it okay
you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> automatically<00:01:53.189> builds

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you can see that it automatically builds

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.090 
you can see that it automatically builds
relief<00:01:53.880> when<00:01:54.299> needed<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.829> void

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
relief when needed and here is that void

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.700 
relief when needed and here is that void

know pick up this hole and and throw

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
know pick up this hole and and throw
something<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> fasten<00:02:01.619> these<00:02:01.710> parts

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
something in there to fasten these parts

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.090 
something in there to fasten these parts
together<00:02:03.439> all<00:02:04.439> right<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> key

features<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.299> doing<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.750> top-down<00:02:07.170> design

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
features of doing this top-down design

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
features of doing this top-down design
is<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:08.069> modification

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
is when we make modification

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.730 
is when we make modification
for<00:02:09.540> example<00:02:09.870> if<00:02:09.930> I<00:02:09.990> change<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> box

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
for example if I change the box

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.890 
for example if I change the box
dimensions<00:02:11.340> let's<00:02:11.520> say<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.880> know<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.720> make

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
dimensions let's say we know we we make

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.210 
dimensions let's say we know we we make
this<00:02:13.080> something<00:02:13.440> else<00:02:13.560> make<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> little<00:02:14.070> bit

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
this something else make it a little bit

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.390 
this something else make it a little bit
longer<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.820> higher<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
longer or higher or you know in this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490 
longer or higher or you know in this
case<00:02:17.610> changing<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> height<00:02:18.390> width<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:19.020> depth

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
case changing the height width or depth

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
case changing the height width or depth
it<00:02:19.710> doesn't<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.040> matter<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.940> top<00:02:21.300> cover<00:02:21.600> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it doesn't really matter my top cover is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440 
it doesn't really matter my top cover is
always<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.560> adjust<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.240> what<00:02:24.360> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
always going to adjust to it so what it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.730 
always going to adjust to it so what it
does<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> goes<00:02:25.020> through<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
does is it goes through and it's you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.050 
does is it goes through and it's you
know<00:02:25.770> looking<00:02:26.220> at<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.670> things<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:26.970> it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
know looking at all the things that it

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.720 
know looking at all the things that it
needs<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.450> build<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:28.890> builds<00:02:29.550> them

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
needs to build and it just builds them

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.730 
needs to build and it just builds them
for<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.240> all<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.750> flanges<00:02:31.170> are<00:02:31.350> still

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
for me so all the flanges are still

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.370 
for me so all the flanges are still
correct<00:02:32.160> size<00:02:32.460> we<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.000> anything

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
correct size we don't have anything

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
correct size we don't have anything
interfering<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:35.160> that's<00:02:35.940> why<00:02:36.210> we<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.540> top

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
interfering so that's why we do top

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720 
interfering so that's why we do top
level<00:02:37.140> design<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.800> make<00:02:37.950> changes<00:02:38.490> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
level design so we can make changes to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
level design so we can make changes to
even<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> single<00:02:39.570> part<00:02:39.750> very<00:02:39.930> quickly<00:02:40.170> but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
even the single part very quickly but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.190 
even the single part very quickly but
all<00:02:40.710> other<00:02:41.040> parts<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.490> need<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> move<00:02:42.200> make

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
all other parts that need to move make

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.650 
all other parts that need to move make
their<00:02:43.350> adjustments<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:43.950> well<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.510> other

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
their adjustments as well the other

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.100 
their adjustments as well the other
thing<00:02:46.310> we<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.820> built<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:48.870> these

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
thing we can do we built all these

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.930 
thing we can do we built all these
features<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.740> context<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.460> assembly

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
features in the context of the assembly

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.970 
features in the context of the assembly
but<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.750> always<00:02:52.020> open<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.470> up<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.710> its<00:02:52.800> own

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
but I can always open it up in its own

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
but I can always open it up in its own
window<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.640> work<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.480> doesn't

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
window and work on it here doesn't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.420 
window and work on it here doesn't
really<00:02:54.900> make<00:02:55.170> any<00:02:55.320> difference<00:02:55.680> where<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.130> my

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
really make any difference where I do my

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
really make any difference where I do my
work
