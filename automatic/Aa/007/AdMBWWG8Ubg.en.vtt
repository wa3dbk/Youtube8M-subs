00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.349
 a country nimoy commemorates star trek the 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.230
 special in flight because we mourn 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.640
 namely make communicator earrings and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 then we sting in the fast scooter 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 we need a lot for that today 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 kram stupid sign paper leather 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 or artificial leather for the vegan gold and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 Silver color hanger pliers and one 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.160
 everything seemed to become moment 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.300
 have the on the enterprise with kirk 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.450
 and spock the part actually used 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 i had the logo somewhere 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 do not even take it anymore 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 why there were so many here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 on the uniform but you had them 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 but they did not have it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 used so it was not usable you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:00.629
 only the ones had to open the level 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:01.980
 to you so you end up a lot locked up 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.660
 and always this noise was recorded 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 Why would you finally have the right one ? 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.119
 noise on the foliage would rise all the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.909
 So the thing also writes by phone 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.140
 they cut that too because now 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.140
 my mother is also the giant treki 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.490
 and I grew up with the track 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.509
 because they are not what others are 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.659

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.679

 concert for two and create two 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.680
 Renting a servo is always going to be that 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.630
 bÃ¤ndchen 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.550
 I now have these golden tiles 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.440
 painted with the gold color and the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.879
 dry now for a moment 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.319
 then we simply turn the silver bow 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.460
 christmas market the gravel on the want 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.740
 the stick but dry properly 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.740
 leave because otherwise it makes courage and it releases 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.819
 everything from the star trek up or down 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.530
 even eat 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.050

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.900
 get to know and how we manage 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.889
 I do not think we'll experience that anymore 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 always need it 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.479
 to make transparent piles 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.919
 just because we put that on 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.710
 shipment on my head I want 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.870
 someday a best-of-people 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.659
 crisis in the circle kleve Ticino 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.919
 if possible do not burn me a million 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.919
 it does not matter 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.599

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.990

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.300
 very close 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.580
 the male variant would be now 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.180
 then glue a brooch on the back 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:54.060
 You could actually design that 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:58.099
 good piece of basin and of course better 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.330
 if they build on it and do so 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.400
 if that's all dry now and 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.430
 finished glued and then we sting 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.539
 with a thick hole up here 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.139
 christmas tree ornaments lynn at the end can 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.030
 everything is always more research 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:14.289

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.860
 Mexicans are always driving by then 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.740
 All the clothes would be off the body 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:29.189
 do not beat and then be wild 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.189
 drive power play to find 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.749

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:49.910
 sport with, we can indeed another 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.140
