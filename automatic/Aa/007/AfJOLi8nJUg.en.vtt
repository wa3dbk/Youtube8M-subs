scientist and I'm working on a mission

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.630 
scientist and I'm working on a mission
studying<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.740> Sun<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.220> I've<00:00:05.339> been<00:00:05.430> asked<00:00:05.580> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
studying the Sun so I've been asked to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.830 
studying the Sun so I've been asked to
show<00:00:05.850> you<00:00:05.910> my<00:00:06.120> top<00:00:06.180> 10<00:00:06.600> images<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.560> Sun

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
show you my top 10 images of the Sun

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.799 
show you my top 10 images of the Sun
this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.410> movie<00:00:10.950> taken<00:00:11.429> by<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.300> Soho

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
this is a movie taken by the Soho

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.709 
this is a movie taken by the Soho
spacecraft<00:00:12.870> there<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.799> an<00:00:14.429> eruption<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
spacecraft there was an eruption on the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.779 
spacecraft there was an eruption on the
surface<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> Sun<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
surface of the Sun and you can see this

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.029 
surface of the Sun and you can see this
is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> solar<00:00:18.270> surface<00:00:18.480> zoomed<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.500> but

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
is the solar surface zoomed right in but

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
is the solar surface zoomed right in but
it's<00:00:20.160> been<00:00:20.400> observed<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:21.119> extreme

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it's been observed in extreme

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's been observed in extreme
ultraviolet<00:00:22.289> light<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> very<00:00:23.250> very

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
ultraviolet light so this is very very

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910 
ultraviolet light so this is very very
hot<00:00:23.699> gases<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> sun's<00:00:24.630> atmosphere<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hot gases in the sun's atmosphere and as

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.099 
hot gases in the sun's atmosphere and as
the<00:00:26.099> Sun<00:00:26.310> rotates<00:00:26.519> round<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.390> complex

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the Sun rotates round this complex

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
the Sun rotates round this complex
region<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> magnetic<00:00:28.890> fields<00:00:29.340> here<00:00:29.689> spits<00:00:30.689> out

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
region of magnetic fields here spits out

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
region of magnetic fields here spits out
a<00:00:31.019> violent<00:00:31.560> cloud<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> particles<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a violent cloud of particles which you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
a violent cloud of particles which you
can<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.090> zapping<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> detector<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
can see zapping the detector of the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
can see zapping the detector of the
cameras<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:36.149> rotates<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.780> bit

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
cameras and it rotates a little bit

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.100 
cameras and it rotates a little bit
further<00:00:37.110> again<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.160> another<00:00:38.219> great<00:00:38.879> big

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
further again there's another great big

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
further again there's another great big
spout<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.320> particles<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.070> eruption

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
spout of particles this eruption

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
spout of particles this eruption
actually<00:00:42.270> went<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.020> cause<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
actually went on to cause a and a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.850 
actually went on to cause a and a
spectacular<00:00:44.879> auroral<00:00:45.660> display<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.320> Earth<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
spectacular auroral display at Earth and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
spectacular auroral display at Earth and
caused<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.460> kinds<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.770> interactions<00:00:49.770> with

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
caused all kinds of interactions with

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
caused all kinds of interactions with
the<00:00:50.190> atmosphere<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.820> spacecraft<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.660> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the atmosphere and spacecraft and it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
the atmosphere and spacecraft and it's
considered<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> definitive

considered to be one of the definitive

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
considered to be one of the definitive
events<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.750> studying<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> Sun<00:00:55.800> can

affect the earth this is the first image

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
affect the earth this is the first image
that<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> saw<00:01:00.449> from<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> stereo<00:01:01.800> mission<00:01:02.129> where

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that I saw from the stereo mission where

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.600 
that I saw from the stereo mission where
they<00:01:02.460> had<00:01:02.640> combined<00:01:04.189> views<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.400> both

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
they had combined views from both

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
they had combined views from both
spacecraft<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.479> create<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> three-dimensional

time in 2004 we actually witnessed a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.999 
time in 2004 we actually witnessed a
transit<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> Venus<00:01:43.049> across<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> Sun<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.950> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
transit of Venus across the Sun this is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.550 
transit of Venus across the Sun this is
where<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.850> planet<00:01:45.180> Venus<00:01:45.540> moves<00:01:45.930> between<00:01:46.409> us

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
where the planet Venus moves between us

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
where the planet Venus moves between us
and<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> Sun<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.159> appears<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> tiny

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
star and this doesn't happen very often
the<00:01:53.399> alignment<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.850> planets<00:01:54.240> has<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> such

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the alignment the planets has to be such

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.819 
the alignment the planets has to be such
that<00:01:55.280> they<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.460> crosses<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> disk<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
that they actually crosses the disk and

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.600 
that they actually crosses the disk and

that's the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.719> an<00:02:00.840> event<00:02:01.290> where<00:02:01.469> we

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
Laboratory here we had an event where we

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
Laboratory here we had an event where we
set<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.060> telescope<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:04.079> had<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
set up a telescope we had in the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
set up a telescope we had in the
classroom<00:02:05.280> behind<00:02:05.759> us<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> lecture

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
classroom behind us I think the lecture

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.670 
classroom behind us I think the lecture
theater<00:02:06.689> behind<00:02:06.810> us<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.170> had<00:02:07.290> something<00:02:07.560> like

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
theater behind us we had something like

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
theater behind us we had something like
a<00:02:07.710> hundred<00:02:07.979> children<00:02:08.550> who<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.789> sat<00:02:09.000> watching

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a hundred children who are sat watching

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
a hundred children who are sat watching
this<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:09.720> sat<00:02:10.050> transfixed<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.920> silence

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
this and they sat transfixed in silence

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.550 
this and they sat transfixed in silence
as<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.540> dot

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
as this little dot

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
as this little dot
across<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> surface<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> Sun<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
across the surface of the Sun and as it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.960 
across the surface of the Sun and as it
left<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> other<00:02:16.080> side<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.560> applauded

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
left the other side they all applauded

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.150 
left the other side they all applauded
it<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.330> sweet<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> really

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it was really sweet so that was a really

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.220 
it was really sweet so that was a really
interesting<00:02:20.510> event<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.690> us<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.959> actually<00:02:22.050> see

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
interesting event for us to actually see

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.839 
interesting event for us to actually see
another<00:02:22.560> planet<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.190> makes<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.489> realise

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
another planet and it makes you realise

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.370 
another planet and it makes you realise
the<00:02:24.120> relative<00:02:24.480> sizes<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.900> these<00:02:25.080> things

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the relative sizes of these things

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.100 
the relative sizes of these things
though<00:02:25.650> venus<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> planet<00:02:26.930> not<00:02:27.930> much

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
though venus is a planet not much

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.540 
though venus is a planet not much
smaller<00:02:28.440> than<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> earth<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.340> was

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
smaller than the earth and it just was

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.710 
smaller than the earth and it just was
dwarfed<00:02:30.090> by<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.110> Sun<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> background

solar<00:02:40.440> wind<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.430> was<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.819> first

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
solar wind and this was the first

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.050 
solar wind and this was the first
unequivocal<00:02:43.590> solar<00:02:44.160> storm<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.880> saw

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
unequivocal solar storm that we saw

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460 
unequivocal solar storm that we saw
launched<00:02:45.360> from<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> Sun<00:02:45.810> heading<00:02:46.110> towards

launched from the Sun heading towards
the<00:02:46.590> earth<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.549> right<00:02:48.000> hand<00:02:48.239> side<00:02:48.480> here

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the earth so on the right hand side here

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.259 
the earth so on the right hand side here
you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:48.989> see<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.440> storm<00:02:49.980> being<00:02:50.549> launched<00:02:51.090> and

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
you can see a storm being launched and

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.850 
you can see a storm being launched and
it<00:02:51.569> crosses<00:02:51.930> from<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.140> inner<00:02:52.290> camera<00:02:52.680> through

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
it crosses from the inner camera through

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.370 
it crosses from the inner camera through
to<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> outer<00:02:53.250> camera<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:54.269> washes<00:02:54.720> past<00:02:54.989> Venus

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
to the outer camera it washes past Venus

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.020 
to the outer camera it washes past Venus
and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:55.980> our<00:02:56.130> planet<00:02:56.489> here<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
and then this is our planet here and the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.130 
and then this is our planet here and the
reason<00:02:57.239> we<00:02:57.299> want<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.630> about<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.989> is

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
reason we want to know about this is

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.330 
reason we want to know about this is
that<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> protect<00:02:58.860> our<00:02:59.069> ever

we'd ever reached at that point and just

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.410 
we'd ever reached at that point and just
contemplate<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.160> everything<00:03:44.819> we<00:03:44.940> ever<00:03:45.090> knew

was in that tiny little blue pixel this
is<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> picture<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.910> took<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.750> was<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> an

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
is a picture that I took it was a an

is a picture that I took it was a an
annular<00:03:53.280> solar<00:03:53.670> eclipse<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.569> took

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
annular solar eclipse and it took

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
occurred over southern Spain in 2005 I

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.759 
occurred over southern Spain in 2005 I
think<00:03:59.600> an<00:04:00.600> annular<00:04:01.049> eclipse<00:04:01.079> is<00:04:01.470> where<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
to be able to see this but even so

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.810 
to be able to see this but even so
there's<00:04:22.560> all<00:04:22.620> these<00:04:22.710> wonderful<00:04:23.190> rings<00:04:23.580> of

be<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.380> great<00:04:28.680> scientific<00:04:29.190> image<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.640> think<00:04:29.790> it's

be a great scientific image I think it's

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.750 
be a great scientific image I think it's
really<00:04:30.210> pretty

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
really pretty

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.490 
really pretty

but during the annular eclipse that I

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.070 
but during the annular eclipse that I
went<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:34.980> see<00:04:35.130> in<00:04:35.280> Spain<00:04:35.670> we<00:04:36.480> witnessed<00:04:36.930> some

went to see in Spain we witnessed some

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.140 
went to see in Spain we witnessed some
of<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.320> peculiar<00:04:38.070> phenomena<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.060> you

fantastic<00:05:25.230> scale<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:25.860> these<00:05:26.010> storms<00:05:27.000> this<00:05:27.120> is

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
fantastic scale of these storms this is

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.000 
fantastic scale of these storms this is
the<00:05:27.450> planet<00:05:27.780> Mercury<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:28.919> the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
to be set on Mercury at the best of

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.330 
to be set on Mercury at the best of
times<00:05:33.270> but<00:05:33.780> when<00:05:34.260> you've<00:05:34.410> got<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.770> storm<00:05:35.130> that's

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
times but when you've got a storm that's

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.390 
times but when you've got a storm that's
a<00:05:35.660> billion<00:05:36.660> tons<00:05:36.900> of<00:05:37.080> material<00:05:37.590> whizzing<00:05:38.220> past

you at a million miles an hour

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.380 
you at a million miles an hour
really<00:05:40.620> must<00:05:40.800> be<00:05:40.860> quite<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.430> daunting<00:05:42.270> prospect

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
really must be quite a daunting prospect

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.390 
really must be quite a daunting prospect
this<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.660> an<00:05:45.900> image<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.620> sunspot<00:05:47.040> that<00:05:47.340> I

this is an image of a sunspot that I

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.860 
this is an image of a sunspot that I
took<00:05:47.460> with<00:05:47.850> my<00:05:47.970> little<00:05:48.120> telescope<00:05:48.479> in<00:05:48.780> the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
took with my little telescope in the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.960 
took with my little telescope in the
back<00:05:49.020> garden<00:05:49.229> I've<00:05:49.710> got<00:05:49.890> a<00:05:49.919> filter<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.610> can<00:05:50.820> put

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
back garden I've got a filter I can put

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.909 
back garden I've got a filter I can put
on<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.150> end<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.300> my<00:05:51.390> telescope<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:52.050> enable<00:05:52.830> me

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
on the end of my telescope to enable me

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.830 
on the end of my telescope to enable me
to<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.340> view<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.640> Sun<00:05:53.850> with<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.570> sun's

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
to to view the Sun with it the sun's

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.440 
to to view the Sun with it the sun's
been<00:05:55.050> really<00:05:55.740> quiet<00:05:56.040> really<00:05:56.669> really<00:05:56.940> inactive

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
been really quiet really really inactive

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.969 
been really quiet really really inactive
and<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.660> can<00:05:57.780> see<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.169> it's<00:05:58.320> almost

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
and you can see that it's almost

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.880 
and you can see that it's almost
completely<00:05:59.400> blank<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.150> disk<00:06:00.390> but<00:06:00.690> just<00:06:01.530> down

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
completely blank the disk but just down

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.510 
completely blank the disk but just down
on<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:02.900> bottom<00:06:03.900> left-hand<00:06:04.800> corner<00:06:05.370> there's

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
on this bottom left-hand corner there's

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.090 
on this bottom left-hand corner there's
a<00:06:05.640> couple<00:06:05.910> of<00:06:06.120> dots<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.540> these<00:06:06.720> sunspots<00:06:07.169> are

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
a couple of dots and these sunspots are

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.550 
a couple of dots and these sunspots are
an<00:06:08.370> indication<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.870> sun's<00:06:10.350> magnetic

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
an indication that the sun's magnetic

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.650 
an indication that the sun's magnetic
field<00:06:11.040> has<00:06:11.220> time<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.580> wind<00:06:11.850> up<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:12.240> get<00:06:12.360> active

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
field has time to wind up and get active

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.450 
field has time to wind up and get active
again<00:06:12.750> so<00:06:13.050> this<00:06:13.200> was<00:06:13.350> one<00:06:14.040> of<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.220> first

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
again so this was one of the first

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.600 
again so this was one of the first
indications<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.540> the<00:06:16.169> Sun<00:06:16.410> was<00:06:16.770> finishing

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
indications that the Sun was finishing

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.690 
indications that the Sun was finishing
this<00:06:18.470> long<00:06:19.470> sleep<00:06:19.860> at<00:06:20.040> it<00:06:20.160> had<00:06:20.310> him<00:06:20.430> as<00:06:20.610> he

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
this long sleep at it had him as he

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.890 
this long sleep at it had him as he
started<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.060> wake<00:06:21.210> up<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.510> do<00:06:21.600> something

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
started to wake up and do something

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.350 
started to wake up and do something
interesting<00:06:22.020> again<00:06:22.610> each<00:06:23.610> sunspots<00:06:24.150> about

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
interesting again each sunspots about

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.909 
interesting again each sunspots about
the<00:06:24.510> size<00:06:24.720> of<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:24.960> earth<00:06:24.990> so<00:06:25.650> they're<00:06:25.830> not

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
the size of the earth so they're not

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.060 
the size of the earth so they're not
actually<00:06:26.160> very<00:06:26.580> small<00:06:26.880> but<00:06:27.680> comparison<00:06:28.680> with

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
actually very small but comparison with

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.460 
actually very small but comparison with
the<00:06:29.250> vast<00:06:30.000> disk<00:06:30.450> of<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.660> Sun<00:06:30.750> they<00:06:31.050> do<00:06:31.110> appear

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
the vast disk of the Sun they do appear

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.050 
the vast disk of the Sun they do appear
to<00:06:31.560> be<00:06:31.680> tiny<00:06:32.460> little<00:06:32.729> regions<00:06:34.400> so<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.729> the

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
to be tiny little regions so that the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.760 
to be tiny little regions so that the
tenth<00:06:36.570> image<00:06:36.870> is<00:06:37.020> something<00:06:37.140> that<00:06:37.530> a

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
tenth image is something that a

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.890 
tenth image is something that a
colleague<00:06:38.070> of<00:06:38.130> mine<00:06:38.190> published

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
colleague of mine published

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.140 
colleague of mine published
and<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.710> think<00:06:39.889> it's<00:06:40.009> an<00:06:40.130> amazing<00:06:40.430> image<00:06:40.850> is<00:06:41.030> the

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
and I think it's an amazing image is the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.450 
and I think it's an amazing image is the
first<00:06:41.449> image<00:06:41.990> ever<00:06:42.229> recorded<00:06:42.919> of<00:06:43.040> a<00:06:43.130> sunspot

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
first image ever recorded of a sunspot

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.999 
first image ever recorded of a sunspot
in<00:06:43.759> the<00:06:43.970> literature<00:06:44.360> so<00:06:44.690> that's<00:06:45.560> a<00:06:45.650> follow<00:06:45.830> me

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
in the literature so that's a follow me

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.860 
in the literature so that's a follow me
we'll<00:06:46.220> head<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.120> library<00:06:47.479> and<00:06:47.570> digging

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
we'll head to the library and digging

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:58.029 
we'll head to the library and digging
out<00:06:47.960> the<00:06:48.110> shelves<00:06:53.590> so<00:06:54.590> in<00:06:55.070> here<00:06:55.780> is<00:06:56.780> this<00:06:57.320> this

this is his drawing of the sunspot and

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.070 
this is his drawing of the sunspot and
he<00:07:14.000> said<00:07:14.270> he<00:07:14.449> saw<00:07:14.720> a<00:07:15.530> large<00:07:16.100> spot<00:07:17.090> to<00:07:17.720> the<00:07:17.840> top

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
he said he saw a large spot to the top

and a small spot underneath and he tried

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.529 
and a small spot underneath and he tried
to<00:07:20.810> draw<00:07:21.050> what<00:07:21.830> he<00:07:21.979> saw<00:07:22.300> so<00:07:23.300> he's<00:07:23.389> the<00:07:23.510> first

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.539 
to draw what he saw so he's the first
