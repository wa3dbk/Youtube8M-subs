00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it so that it is indistinguishable the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.820

writing<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.910> drawing<00:00:18.350> so<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.560> it's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

almost in my mind I have to make it so
so<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> almost<00:00:23.279> don't<00:00:23.609> draw<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> sting<00:00:24.269> shion's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
so I almost don't draw the sting shion's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750

transparency<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.470> sort<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> collage

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
transparency and I can sort of collage

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.640 
transparency and I can sort of collage
it<00:01:32.220> together<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:32.880> other<00:01:33.000> things<00:01:33.650> try

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it together with some other things try

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.749 
it together with some other things try
to<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> nice<00:01:35.310> contrast<00:01:36.030> between<00:01:37.490> how<00:01:38.490> much

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to make a nice contrast between how much

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149 
to make a nice contrast between how much
is<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.540> specifically<00:01:40.259> rendered<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> what's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
is very specifically rendered and what's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.120 
is very specifically rendered and what's
realistic<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> contrast<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.040> know

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
realistic with the contrast of you know

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
realistic with the contrast of you know
what's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.579> bit<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.939> ambiguous<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
what's a little bit more ambiguous and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
what's a little bit more ambiguous and
abstract<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.220> there's<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:48.299> you're

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
abstract because there's when you're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.030 
abstract because there's when you're
working<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.869> after<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> while<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.860> sort

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
working on this after a while you sort

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
working on this after a while you sort
of<00:01:50.159> realize<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.119> make<00:01:51.329> everything<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
of realize if you make everything if you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.340 
of realize if you make everything if you
give<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> audience<00:01:52.829> 100%<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.729> everything

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
give the audience 100% of everything

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
give the audience 100% of everything
there's<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> certain<00:01:55.829> point<00:01:55.979> where<00:01:56.299> they<00:01:57.299> don't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
there's a certain point where they don't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270 
there's a certain point where they don't
have<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:57.840> about<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> anymore<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
have to think about it anymore so what I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.179 
have to think about it anymore so what I
try<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.360> try<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.659> give<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.189> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
try to do is I try to give them just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.749

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
enough where they finish the idea in

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
enough where they finish the idea in
their<00:02:05.850> mind<00:02:05.909> writing<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.259> drawing<00:02:07.710> and
