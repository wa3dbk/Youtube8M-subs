00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
side and fits the hand really really

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210

nice<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> grips<00:01:21.810> into<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> hand<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
nice and it grips into the hand there it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
nice and it grips into the hand there it
also<00:01:23.400> has<00:01:23.700> these<00:01:24.180> cutouts<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.439> the

also has these cutouts on the on the
handle<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.520> assuming<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.090> helps<00:01:27.810> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
handle which I'm assuming it helps with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.600 
handle which I'm assuming it helps with
the<00:01:27.930> weight<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.250> got<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> pretty

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the weight and it's got a pretty

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.749 
the weight and it's got a pretty
generous<00:01:30.000> lanyard<00:01:30.810> hole<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.409> there

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
generous lanyard hole in the back there

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
generous lanyard hole in the back there
it<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> pivot<00:01:33.600> screw<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it does have the pivot screw so you can

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
it does have the pivot screw so you can
adjust<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> particular<00:01:36.329> knife

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
adjust it and with this particular knife

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
adjust it and with this particular knife
it<00:01:37.079> came<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:38.280> tight<00:01:38.579> from<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> factory

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it came very very tight from the factory

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
it came very very tight from the factory
almost<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> point<00:01:40.560> where<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.369> thumb

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
almost to the point where on the thumb

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.749 
almost to the point where on the thumb
stud<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.030> which<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> used<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> deploy<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
stud here which is used to deploy it

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
stud here which is used to deploy it
because<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.299> shallow<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.380> cut<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
because of how shallow the cut in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
because of how shallow the cut in the
handle<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.210> made<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.229> very

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
handle is right here made it very very

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
handle is right here made it very very
difficult<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.159> deploy<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.299> mean<00:01:51.689> sometimes

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
difficult to deploy and I mean sometimes

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.100 
difficult to deploy and I mean sometimes
kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> practice<00:01:53.310> real<00:01:54.060> hard<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
kind of practice real hard to do it and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.499 
kind of practice real hard to do it and
as<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
as you can see you know if you want to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.030 
as you can see you know if you want to
flick<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> definitely<00:01:58.799> takes<00:01:58.950> some

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
flick it out it definitely takes some

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.190 
flick it out it definitely takes some
practice<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.850> very<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.479> difficult<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
practice it's very very difficult and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.050 
practice it's very very difficult and
that<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that would be one of the one of the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.280 
that would be one of the one of the
Knicks<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.630> give<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> actual

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
Knicks that I would give to the actual

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.280 
Knicks that I would give to the actual
knife<00:02:04.560> um<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> best

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
knife um it's it's not the best

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.040 
knife um it's it's not the best
centering<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> blade<00:02:08.629> but<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
centering on the blade but you know that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
centering on the blade but you know that
that<00:02:10.319> has<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.580> me<00:02:11.730> having<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that has to do with with me having to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.729 
that has to do with with me having to
loosen<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.810> little<00:02:13.050> bit<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.379> be<00:02:13.500> able<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
loosen this a little bit to be able to

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.910 
loosen this a little bit to be able to
make

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
make

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.309 
make
a lot<00:02:14.190> easier<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> open<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.420> figured

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
a lot easier to open so I figured

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.900 
a lot easier to open so I figured
playing<00:02:16.620> around<00:02:16.830> where<00:02:17.069> they<00:02:17.160> may<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.400> putting

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
playing around where they may be putting

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.339 
playing around where they may be putting
some<00:02:18.030> Loctite<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.569> something<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.170> there

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
some Loctite or something that in there

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.350 
some Loctite or something that in there
will<00:02:19.709> definitely<00:02:20.099> help<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.760> does<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.150> some

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
will definitely help it does have some

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880 
will definitely help it does have some
of<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> brass<00:02:21.750> rings<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
of the brass rings in there and that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
of the brass rings in there and that
does<00:02:23.069> help<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.730> smoothness<00:02:24.480> once<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
does help with the smoothness once you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.670 
does help with the smoothness once you
get<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> open<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.840> has<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
get it open so you know so that has to a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220 
get it open so you know so that has to a
lot<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.010> play<00:02:29.160> into<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.459> um<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.510> other<00:02:30.540> lock<00:02:31.050> up

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230

to be able to open it so you know what

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.569 
to be able to open it so you know what
I've<00:03:28.200> noticed<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:29.250> will<00:03:29.400> probably

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
I've noticed is that this will probably

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.580 
I've noticed is that this will probably
be<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.820> lot<00:03:30.090> easier<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.480> try<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.170> open<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.440> with

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
be a lot easier to try and open it with

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.949 
be a lot easier to try and open it with
two<00:03:31.739> hands<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:33.180> almost<00:03:33.359> like<00:03:33.630> you

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
two hands you know so almost like you

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.780 
two hands you know so almost like you
know<00:03:34.079> almost<00:03:34.380> consider<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.950> maybe<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:35.730> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
know almost consider this maybe like a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.729 
know almost consider this maybe like a
gentleman's<00:03:36.209> folder<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:37.170> take<00:03:37.410> off<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
gentleman's folder maybe take off the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.800 
gentleman's folder maybe take off the
pocket<00:03:38.070> clip<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.549> slip<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.390> into<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.600> pocket

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pocket clip and slip it into a pocket

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.740 
pocket clip and slip it into a pocket
because<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.410> very<00:03:40.500> very<00:03:40.799> thin<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:42.359> you<00:03:42.420> you

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
because it is very very thin so you you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.240 
because it is very very thin so you you
know<00:03:42.840> you'd<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.140> able<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.410> do<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.010> would

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
know you'd be able to do that it would

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.650 
know you'd be able to do that it would
probably<00:03:44.519> disappear<00:03:45.120> into<00:03:45.239> maybe<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
probably disappear into maybe like a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.440 
probably disappear into maybe like a
back<00:03:45.900> pocket<00:03:46.140> or<00:03:46.410> something<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.799> um

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
back pocket or something like that um

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
back pocket or something like that um
just<00:03:48.450> because<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.010> thickness<00:03:50.400> of

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
just because of the of the thickness of

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.860 
just because of the of the thickness of
the<00:03:50.609> blade<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the blade and just you know the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.620 
the blade and just you know the
construction<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.980> would<00:03:53.489> ply<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.510> know

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
construction I I would ply not you know

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.650 
construction I I would ply not you know
uses<00:03:55.079> as<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> primary<00:03:55.560> EDC<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.430> would<00:03:57.299> use<00:03:57.450> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
uses as a primary EDC I would use it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.750 
uses as a primary EDC I would use it
maybe<00:03:57.930> as<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.140> secondary<00:03:58.680> knife<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.430> an<00:03:59.519> EDC

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
maybe as a secondary knife to an EDC

self-defense knife I mean this the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
thickness of the blade makes it really

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.490 
thickness of the blade makes it really
really<00:04:08.579> easy<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:09.959> for<00:04:10.200> opening

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
really easy you know for opening

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.140 
really easy you know for opening
envelope<00:04:10.680> sand<00:04:11.310> boxes<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:11.850> things<00:04:11.880> like<00:04:12.090> that

envelope sand boxes and things like that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.520 
envelope sand boxes and things like that
you<00:04:12.299> know<00:04:12.510> because<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.959> slide<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.410> there

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
you know because it can slide in there

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.770 
you know because it can slide in there
real<00:04:13.769> real<00:04:14.130> nicely<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.389> know<00:04:15.480> if<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:15.660> had

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
real real nicely but you know if you had

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.569 
real real nicely but you know if you had
to<00:04:15.900> do<00:04:16.019> some<00:04:16.229> heavy<00:04:16.410> maybe<00:04:16.739> cardboard<00:04:17.280> cutting

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
to do some heavy maybe cardboard cutting

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.800 
to do some heavy maybe cardboard cutting
or<00:04:17.729> something<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.510> don't<00:04:18.750> think

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
or something like that I don't think

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.449 
or something like that I don't think
this<00:04:19.049> would<00:04:19.229> this<00:04:19.709> would<00:04:19.919> stand<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.430> that

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
this would this would stand up to that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.149 
this would this would stand up to that
now<00:04:21.239> by<00:04:21.510> by<00:04:22.049> way<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.260> comparison<00:04:22.500> I've<00:04:23.010> got

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
now by by way of comparison I've got

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.180 
now by by way of comparison I've got
another<00:04:23.370> crash<00:04:23.669> ah<00:04:23.789> here<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.570> OD<00:04:25.200> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
another crash ah here this is the OD to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.060 
another crash ah here this is the OD to
you<00:04:26.820> know<00:04:26.940> which<00:04:27.210> which<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.750> can<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.230> know<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
you know which which I can you know the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.360 
you know which which I can you know the
blade<00:04:29.370> with<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.870> way<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.560> very<00:04:31.710> similar<00:04:32.070> on

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
blade with this way it's very similar on

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.000 
blade with this way it's very similar on
both<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.910> these<00:04:33.530> same<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> blade

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
both of these same as the blade

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.850 
both of these same as the blade
thickness<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.580> both<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.150> them<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.860> then

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
thickness on both of them and then

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.490 
thickness on both of them and then
they're<00:04:38.520> both<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.940> tr13<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.810> movie<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.470> then

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
they're both a tr13 a movie and then

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.070 
they're both a tr13 a movie and then
also<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.910> know<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.180> go<00:04:42.660> with<00:04:42.780> something<00:04:42.930> a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
also you know to go with something a

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.540 
also you know to go with something a
little<00:04:43.200> bigger<00:04:43.410> here's<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.950> spyderco

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
little bigger here's the spyderco

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.970 
little bigger here's the spyderco
tenacious<00:04:45.200> just<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.350> can<00:04:46.470> see<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.800> size

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
tenacious just so you can see the size

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.590 
tenacious just so you can see the size
difference<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.610> know<00:04:47.640> spyderco<00:04:48.570> tenacious

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
difference you know spyderco tenacious

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.170 
difference you know spyderco tenacious
is<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.590> part<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.190> lot<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.430> people's<00:04:50.700> edcs

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
is a part of a lot of people's edcs

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.050 
is a part of a lot of people's edcs
and/or<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.110> lot<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.440> people<00:04:52.560> know<00:04:52.680> exactly<00:04:53.060> what

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
and/or a lot of people know exactly what

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.940 
and/or a lot of people know exactly what
this<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.690> size<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.080> this<00:04:55.200> is<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.620> now<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.830> can

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
this the size of this is so now you can

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.670 
this the size of this is so now you can
see<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.100> size<00:04:56.340> comparison<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:58.050> know<00:04:58.170> obviously

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
see a size comparison you know obviously

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.630 
see a size comparison you know obviously
half<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.550> size<00:04:59.760> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.360> handle<00:05:00.780> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.640> blade

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
half the size of the handle on the blade

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.000 
half the size of the handle on the blade
is<00:05:02.790> also<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.150> lot<00:05:03.960> thinner<00:05:04.260> than<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
is also a lot thinner than the the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.260 
is also a lot thinner than the the
tenacious<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:06.750> know<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.260> tenacious<00:05:07.770> being

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270
