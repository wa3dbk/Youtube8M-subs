00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 I'm going to show you a challenge today. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.970
 very cool, I get coins is a challenge 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
 difficulty to talk about what a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 revelation because I can not do it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 challenge to the next challenge is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 you will give the person ten coins in the hand 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 It does not have to be the same currency, but if it is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.039
 in several currencies it is better I have here 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 ten coins of 25 cents 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 Are you going to talk to the person next? 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.960
 You have to get these coins from a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.840
 way you can create five 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.180
 rows five rows with four coins 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.899
 in every language we have ten 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 coins 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 you will create five lines with four 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 coins every fifth line a drawing 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.670
 where it is possible to do that, let's go 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.030
 see if the guys can do it around 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 without forming four five rows with 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:02.250
 four coins each one five lines 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:10.770
 straight with four dollar coins not liking 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:13.640
 it is necessary to touch dots type 915 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.049
 straight lines of four years each 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.909
 using only those same ones 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.130
 You can shake the coins the way you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.189
 You want when you want but at the end 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 35 lines with four years 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.250
 the only restriction that can not be 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.250
 whole life trying to do business 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:46.200
 even if you 're out there cracking your head 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 imagine that it is impossible 4 and 5 da vinci 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 we only have ten coins 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 I'll leave the revelation down here. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 I suggest you try before but like me 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.799
 I already said that I myself was able to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 I know you're going to skip this part. 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.910
 want to see direct regulation 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.640
 okay 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:09.020
 but there are medium or difficult wires like this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.500
 Here you will find in the manual in the world 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.500
 site 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.500
 If you 're there killing yourself to try 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.230
 understand how to arrange these coins 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.180
 Sometimes a young man was down there. 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.380
 video that I 'll leave as a suggestion to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.130
 always has a hint here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.530
 suggestions 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.890
 Good on this side, I'm leaving the bridge here. 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.780
 of coins is a very crazy architecture 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.870
 made of coins you can do 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.220
 at home a very nice experience and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.560
 on the other side I'll leave a video about 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.810
 surface tension has how many drops 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.400
 of water fits a coin, I'm sure 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.400
 You will be surprised by this video.
