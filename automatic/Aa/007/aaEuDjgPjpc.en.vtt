00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.590
 hi everyone his little mysteries 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.030
 I love when fifty years - that's great 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.470
 mario day find themselves for a 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.510
 David's new life on call of duty 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.850
 kid on the map may day 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.470
 so this leeds video is going to be such 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 qingli effort that we will be teleported 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.670
 in the room where you seem to need 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.559
 to open the door 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.660
 so you have to make this book yourself 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.120
 give it thoroughly not to have destroyed that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 nest and you will have to place yourself in this 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.790
 corner would then have sprinted against the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.879
 nest and you have to jump to the moment where 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.850
 you will have between the two both yes 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.330
 we can say it was going and neil and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.650
 two ways to look for it so it's this 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.900
 bug is an advantage is that the allies 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.070
 do not come or there may be 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.060
 but very little it was said g steel 2 or 3 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 and for example if you want to do yourself 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 the homemade bomb or sticky rocket 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.229
 and well you can take your boots 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 so here you go see that I do it 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.030
 I'm going to make my homemade bomb the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.570
 not believe but I just do not want to take 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.120
 one piece so I'm going to you 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.050
 show that this glitch can be realized 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.630
 with the drill so you'll see that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.610
 you can take the driller years to 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.170
 look it's the same thing you spend 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.940
 in the sprint corner is desired between 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.890
 the halves so a weigh you happen to you 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.290
 that you are teleporting more ahead 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.210
 linux comes in from time to time so there 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.450
 sent flighty forest and you go 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.260
 to be able to see that I can pose is 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.300
 so it's pretty funny 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.590
 and while the nest is in the process of 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.680
 do I feel very nurtured this video 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.840

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.240

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.580
 one of my videos and a greenhouse kroemer 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.090
 and here are the friends it's already the end of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.159
