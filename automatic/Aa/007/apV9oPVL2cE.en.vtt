00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.099
 no 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.949
 the purpose of this training is to give them tools a help 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.159
 to class work 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.479
 on the one hand as to the weekly petition response and then 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.700
 also percent 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.540
 at the rally of choirs 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.879
 please 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.660
 things to know about tools 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.780
 to implement when faced with an extremely large group 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.470
 this is a little bit through the internships we pushed and on different 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.620
 different children 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.210
 but first of all safe work 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.390
 how to make work summer teenagers 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 percent at the vocal level to the question 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.940
 but what do you need to know what is more to be 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 eventually 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.120
 risky to dangerous for those three 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 it's how to write it's a lot so a little bit 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 eight tickets but at the same time extremely educational 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.260
 and then% work time on the gesture because it has a high demand at 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.040
 level of logistics and the precision of the gestures so how do I 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.270
 can transmit music with my gesture because we are still that 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.880
 to make music so for these essays for me what is caught is taken 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.290
 the criteria 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.090
 so now 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.440
 to be in love 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.670
 meters in front of the group and then we tried 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 the power seems to want to come out at the sound 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 with for me 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 really laurent 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 eric woerth 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.649
 he te 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 he was and still is tempting 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.929
 fact 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.929
 or heard notice noticed 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.879
 the health contract of the singer plus the right 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.039
 bhl 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.999
 and rather something incredible 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.299
 what happened in the second version 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.169
 blanchard 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.329
 things are getting hot 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.969
 5 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 at arras landed at more than 900 tons of fodder 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.289
 but how can I change 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 and the interpretation 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.099
 contraception 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.469
 this afternoon 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.399
 this year 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.310
 that is to say more 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.429
 the gessian 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.579
 its account 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.389
 it's a bit 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
 why this person inland 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.429
 the impression of having more information 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:06.919
 at the last moment 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.039
 and that's something that is fundamental 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.979
 in the opposite direction any anticipation in the gers what makes 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.749
 than before 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.789
 of champÃ©ry - argentaria already knows how he does not have the pressure the purpose of 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.509
 this internship was therefore the choir direction 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.529
 also learn the implementation of children's voices so the gestures of the 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:30.149
 direction of class because each of us was trained and and more 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.659
 or less in his studies 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.730
 but it's still like we're called not only led in the 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.499
 ranking even happier at the festival contract with wells to 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.589
 to take with someone who has done his job is still 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:47.479
 an enrichment for us decide it all year the last part it's 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.909
 a time of work with a choir 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.699
 you put your art into practice and the days before during the% 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.529
 try to doubt what impact duchess says that on 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:01.489
 children 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.559
 deadline passage on the earth we came for what to do business ranked 5 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.579
 the justice region to cross France 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.200
 to breathe of course 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.629
 you have to design it so it's all the time 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.669
 according to this the questioning 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.719
 tsrsport ch you have spent 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.719
 scor is canceled what is it 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.469
