really<00:00:00.659> Brian<00:00:01.020> thank<00:00:01.260> you<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.709> know<00:00:02.040> how<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.340> yeah

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
really Brian thank you I know how I yeah

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.990 
really Brian thank you I know how I yeah
all<00:00:02.909> right<00:00:03.090> so<00:00:03.360> on<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.929> bak<00:00:04.170> still<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.529> lab

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
all right so on you bak still a lab

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.220 
all right so on you bak still a lab
alright<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.120> basically<00:00:06.540> we've<00:00:06.690> done<00:00:06.870> here<00:00:09.230> ten

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
alright so basically we've done here ten

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.490 
alright so basically we've done here ten
different<00:00:10.440> banks<00:00:11.450> each<00:00:12.450> bag<00:00:12.750> has<00:00:13.049> three

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
different banks each bag has three

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.939 
different banks each bag has three
different<00:00:13.679> settings<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.340> choose<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.820> so

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
different settings to choose from so

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.980 
different settings to choose from so
basically<00:00:16.949> 30<00:00:17.220> presets<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.690> disposal

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
basically 30 presets at your disposal

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.849 
basically 30 presets at your disposal
that<00:00:19.890> are<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.160> adjustable<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.880> within<00:00:23.880> each

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
that are all adjustable and within each

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.900 
that are all adjustable and within each
setting<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> also<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.369> three<00:00:26.699> different

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
setting you also have three different

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.550 
setting you also have three different
categories<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.050> change<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
categories so you can change the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
categories so you can change the
parameter<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.099> how<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.599> delays

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
parameter of how your how your delays

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.990 
parameter of how your how your delays
behaving<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.740> vacuum<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.790> two

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
behaving in vacuum so I have two

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
behaving in vacuum so I have two
amplifiers<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.110> pan<00:00:34.290> things<00:00:34.559> left

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
amplifiers so I can pan things left

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.479 
amplifiers so I can pan things left
right<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> center<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> crossfade

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
right and center I can do a crossfade

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.500 
right and center I can do a crossfade
pitch<00:00:38.489> shifting<00:00:40.489> not<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.700> every

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
pitch shifting not only that every

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.979 
pitch shifting not only that every
parameter<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.670> assignable<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.870> an

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
parameter on here is a assignable to an

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.189 
parameter on here is a assignable to an
expression<00:00:46.530> pedal<00:00:49.820> whereas<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.210> could<00:00:52.050> just

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
expression pedal whereas I could just

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.040 
expression pedal whereas I could just
hit<00:00:52.320> pedal<00:00:52.820> make<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:54.030> adjustment<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.809> heel

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
hit pedal make my adjustment for heel

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.840 
hit pedal make my adjustment for heel
down<00:00:56.149> assign<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.250> heal<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
down assign it and then do heal up and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
down assign it and then do heal up and
have<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.390> different<00:01:00.570> types<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> different

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
have all different types of different

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
have all different types of different
adjustments<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.730> disposal<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
adjustments and your disposal so you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.430 
adjustments and your disposal so you
have

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
have

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.820 
have
a<00:01:04.500> range<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.340> different<00:01:05.610> feedback<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.830> tone

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a range of different feedback or tone

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
a range of different feedback or tone
speed<00:01:08.190> intensity<00:01:08.820> mix<00:01:09.330> time<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:10.440> in<00:01:10.770> one

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
speed intensity mix time all in one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
speed intensity mix time all in one
expression<00:01:11.220> pedal<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.090> with

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
expression pedal and you can do it with

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.070 
expression pedal and you can do it with
every<00:01:12.630> every<00:01:13.170> bank<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:16.280> 28<00:01:17.280> 28<00:01:17.880> second<00:01:18.510> looper

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
every every bank a 28 28 second looper

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.530 
every every bank a 28 28 second looper
and<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.760> stack<00:01:21.000> multiple<00:01:21.210> tracks<00:01:21.660> on<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
and you can stack multiple tracks on and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.260 
and you can stack multiple tracks on and
the<00:01:24.540> looper<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.410> also<00:01:25.620> has<00:01:26.270> three

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the looper actually also has three

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.820 
the looper actually also has three
different<00:01:27.420> categories<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.590> all

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
different categories that are all

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.710 
different categories that are all
expression<00:01:29.460> pedal<00:01:29.820> assignable<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
expression pedal assignable so I have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:56.249 
expression pedal assignable so I have
three<00:01:30.900> different<00:01:31.080> sounds

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.609 

mostly<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.350> could<00:01:57.470> tackle<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.439> also

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
mostly you could tackle a and this also

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.950 
mostly you could tackle a and this also
serves<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.280> record<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.119> play<00:02:02.390> overdub

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
serves as the record and play overdub

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.719 
serves as the record and play overdub
for<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.259> loopers<00:02:03.590> well<00:02:05.860> that's<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.009> delay<00:02:07.520> lab

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
for the loopers well that's a delay lab

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.399 
for the loopers well that's a delay lab
my<00:02:07.880> box<00:02:08.770> any<00:02:09.770> questions<00:02:10.160> are
