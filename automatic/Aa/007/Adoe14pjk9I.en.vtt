00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.339
 good afternoon new video by you again 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.660
 Nikolay 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:15.630
 us honda cr-v 24 goes on this row 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 cars we did with this engine 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 I â€™ll tell you a long time ago 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.869
 in this car is the engine of the 24th century 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 will say need to be installed here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.780
 oiler 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.780
 here it stands here 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.350
 that is, I will tell you in practice 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.380
 in principle, money can be set 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.080
 the name of the publisher without greasers was pro 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.300
 normal driving dynamics with expiration 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:58.239
 fuel at 4,400 rpm 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.880
 ran through 200 to 30 thousand well here 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:06.220
 Master Barin Shave can be set 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.660
 we have here and the system is and yes there 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.660
 still engaged in them and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.480
 nozzles for night 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.550
 Hannah then they were a little better 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.740
 qualities to tell the way 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.020
 cars again on the variator variator 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.690
 advancing low revving car 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 helps a lot on this car up 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:37.890
 liters we can throw out 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.450
 that is, roughly speaking oiler rests 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.720
 valve load remove burning 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.540
 remove the commune clear on the variator read 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 Watch my videos and videos about the variator 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.700
 read and understand what variators are 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.880
 they say that bad 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.130
 some people just don't understand 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.020
 engineering sense 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 this thing is a principle like a pro link 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.039
 the control unit here in this 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.179
 we are flashing 200,250 dollars 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.170
 control unit 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.760
 and in fact the variator for 1200 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.530
 hryvnia may be 1300 hryvnia 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.530
 depending on the type of calender 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.769
 that is, I basically wanted to explain to you 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 probably, therefore, a scenic stop 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.090
 who can be interested in anyone 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.840
 set us off the car or 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.739
 host 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.930
 to conveniently he watch you gear in 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.319
 this copper 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.370
 e-mail nozzles on 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.850
 security 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 by the way in this nozzle filtering here 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.980
 This does not fit immediately explain and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.420
 gearbox mvl he is there in this place 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.760
 there is a filter inside it 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.860
 but not this, and so understood experimental 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.550
 there was a gorilla pastry need additions 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.550
 equipment 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.849
 but all system software 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.190
 fears so clear there now show by 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.580
 cylinders are also engaged in refueling 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.950
 car air conditioning then cars 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.799
 fully electric equipment 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:27.650
 equipment sensors there everything related 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.989
 with car electronics and onboard 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.890
 computer this car catalysts 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.129
 lambda probes 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.870
 we arrange smith we can check 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.810
 catalysts can see the range 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.480
 working zanda can check workers 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.930
 umbrella or non-working what works we 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.849
 do the control buttons button 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:04:00.709
 control we have here in this 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:05.269
 place near the helm and spam is full of himself 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.470
 here we go under daddy refueling 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.470
 in this world 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.860
 so cars too little video 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.959
 little information so call 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.199
 ask the phones for us to sleep and 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.300
 sleep with us 3w you pump with her 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:29.889
 or Kiev direct telephone number 3 600 443 he 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.430
 it happens that we are collecting mobile 097 mode 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:39.320
 364 1117 Nikolai was with you again 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.620
 and our program of all the best to the new 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.620
 meeting
