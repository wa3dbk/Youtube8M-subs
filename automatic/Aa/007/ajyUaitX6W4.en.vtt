00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.169
 hello you insist young lawyer and at 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 jargon come together for a new 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.239
 video so in this video I'm going to you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 present a glitch minecraft 1.6.2 4 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.689
 which will allow to change the color 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.399
 of your simple because for those who do not 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 not know since the new version 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.710
 unthinkable points 2 and he enjoyed a block 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.510
 which is the orange vine and it's thanks to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 this new block what for having created a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.470
 glyph where the goal will be to change the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.269
 color of your simple then this is to 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.430
 say for example if you have sand 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.329
 yellow and you want to change it 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.219
 orange set 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 you will create these small machines 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.580
 which is very simple to build I will 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.080
 you show it right after and who will 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.670
 allow to change the color of your 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.830
 simple that is, if I put 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.479
 sands game it will turn into a room 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.070
 orange and if I put orange sand 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.619
 level turn into yellow sand 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.590
 so for that it's very simple here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.409
 I have a sand stack of yellow sand 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.570
 good I put myself in game mode a lap in 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 the machine is configured so that the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.470
 young sand turn into sand 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.049
 orange and if I simply pour myself 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 instead here four blocks of sand 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.580
 orange I put four blocks of sand 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 yellow so once did not do this 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.270
 machine that I showed you after you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
 you simply make it here to put 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.790
 your sand stack the color could 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.260
 choose and the chosen museum configuration 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.760
 you stay right click on block b 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.400
 for you and it's just going 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.229
 change the color of your simple without 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 him of dive carles waved this foot a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.310
 yellow sand stack to turn into 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.920
 an orange sand stack and I got 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 re 15.5 in the end and no more and no less 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.770
 so really to a rich duplicator 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.049
 careless to change a color so 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.610
 from time to time you get two 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.869
 blocks it's just the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 color change of that you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.250
 recover otherwise the rest arrives in the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.930
 trunk here and naive I'm going to get 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.580
 an orange sand stain 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.680
 so here and now to do the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.049
 reverse is very simple you go 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.560
 change here the four blocks of sand 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.849
 orange in four blocks of sand I 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 pouffe and a place of simple 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.629
 marry gaulle your orangeville blocks 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 you'll see that this is going to do 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.459
 and then it's born like that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.110
 that to do the reverse that is to say that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.840
 the red sand blocks are going to get 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.549
 turn into a block of yellow sand so 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 really to glitch that can be very 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.409
 useful 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.849
 we will end style you after I 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.620
 explain how to build them and 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.579
 how does it work you will see it's 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 ultra simple 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.250
 So here we have a lot more but 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.340
 when seeing them blay us our stack 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.560
 of yellow sand that is coming so that's it 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.269
 so for the realization it's very 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.209
 we are going to win a 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.430
 you will need to achieve this 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.200
 Machine I will vote the more it 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.450
 present like this I did a little 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.739
 decoration to hide but after the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.510
 decoration you do as you want 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.750
 so to realize it we would need 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 of reston redstone torch of a scream 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.450
 peter of a comparator of two planes of the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.139
 ch'ti pistons on the one hand yesterday of guinea pigs 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.819
 stage 2 stone from his injury him that 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.230
 you want and this tome bricks 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.359
 to make the machine simply or 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 hidden so that's gone you'll see 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.560
 it's very very nice to build so 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.690
 first of all you have to put 4 2 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.150
 billion on the ground for when the symptom 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.769
 merkel for those who do not know a 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.510
 gravity block that falls on the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.609
 demining is broken so it's thanks to that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.220
 I will not change the color of your 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.379
 simple which you put a hole with 4.2 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.199
 me tall in next to these half da 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.000
 had asked us the simple chooses so 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.739
 either their anchovies the yellow is at 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.690
 above this simple two blocks of 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.530
 height ie like this you 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.949
 go ask you re your tracks have like 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.780
 so this is so once you ask 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.269
 pistons like these oriented towards the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.030
 down to the orange sand blocks at 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.639
 on these tracks filed 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.549
 midem names that are glued to the pistons 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.709
 but which are above the piston so 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.030
 this is once done with one of 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.859
 nidal he passed by 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.629
 you do the same thing below where 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.810
 you put a half ton to the 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.820
 piston height that is to say just in 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.159
 below like that you can ask your 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.080
 restaurant right above so a cold 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.330
 do that you fill your middle 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.220
 of the network is next to the half of agde 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.500
 underneath you posed had a little 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.030
 block staircase you have chosen 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.460
 to simply raise the red zone 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.470
 so once done that and from 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.659
 this last block which is put to you here 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.190
 you will put a red stone torch 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.420
 and from this blog you have created a 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.920
 myth and that's it 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.020
 tips that you'll close again from 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.120
 the other side by breaking well the block that 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.770
 turns here so once done this 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.190
 on the block sit at him from the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.930
 resonance and put a repeater in 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.720
 changing by the little con we're going 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.840
 to put back the days this is about the taste of 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.760
 tea here is laid a comparator and 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.750
 you have completed the tea with their 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.730
 studies simply 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.590
 so once done that you did 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.990
 half of the system almost 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.440
 after just simply do 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.210
 your little base to push the blocks 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.480
 so that for break and push more 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.970
 simple and next to that but next to 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.600
 these little passes deposit again 4 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.270
 pistons oriented towards the simple orange 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.950
 body when you put your blog in 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.020
 undermines to change the color the 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.150
 pistons you send it here that go re 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.340
 I'm talking about creating a glitch that will change 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.470
 the sand of colors so once done 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.270
 this on the first 3 pistons you have 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.370
 posed three whites shot with thomas 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.010
 sprinkle water on the fourth 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.670
 is posited a half talent that is no 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.050
 asked while I do not know how 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.450
 say there that is simply asked to 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.850
 the second half including six at this dinner 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.250
 this is brief so once done this is 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.900
 very simple so then here you go 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.850
 put a piston with a block at the end 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.950
 will allow feeding when he goes 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.140
 see the teller the piston to itself 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.750
 retract and the current will pass what 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.340
 will activate these tracks so we have it here 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.830
 is the last thing to do that he is 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.690
 very healthy is that on this first two 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.630
 pistons that you ask yourself on track have 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.370
 facing you with a block at the end 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.100
 and there you just have to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.040
 break the first block of your base or 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.110
 underneath you put your share 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.480
 yesterday from colson with a torch over 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.420
 and one side of this piston that have oriented 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.720
 towards the sand or lay a torch of 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.090
 reston and the gaude system is realized 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.710
 so after a month of course the system 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.180
 wrote hopper below the dunes nidal 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.980
 you do what you want but lost 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.050
 is easier to pick up so 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.740
 then just to put them 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.930
 in inverted commas 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.569
 and we will discuss this simply 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.970
 so picked up the sand that lie 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.370
 here so the orange living room 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.750
 so here we are going to put it in the 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.150
 machine and you'll see know the 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.520
 change color we can wallace a 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.729
 simply created from the change of 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.800
 color so we'll put everything a pop up 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:10.289
 it goes very very long time over that's 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.509
 which is the system well so that's it 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:13.050
 here you recover all our salt blocks 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.599
 orange 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.160
 so here's this glitch it's not about me 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.650
 that he gave in to youtube hour 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.210
 English believes so there will be the link of 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.979
 his string in the description that makes 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.750
 full of clichés but I did not 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.889
 not found in France and therefore in the 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.870
 decided to present it 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.819
 especially when he does it is he 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.710
 does not have the oral is just 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.990
 So here the image that can 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.389
 try to loana glitch hack and do it in 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.069
 hoping they will accept me and feel free to 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.289
 not to leave a boyfriend for this 

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:43.849
 glyph for this bleach change of 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:43.849
 dirty colors was going to go wrong
