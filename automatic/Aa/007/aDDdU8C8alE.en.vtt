00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.260
 Welcome to the preview of Summoner's Rift. You must have heard a lot about updates 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.700
 at Summoner's Rift, so we will share information with you about what we do. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.210
 Let's start from Information Clarity. 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 For us, this is about how to make information in the game easier to digest. One of the ways 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 what we are trying to do is change the coloring, saturation, and level of detail of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.420
 the environment is there, so you can see clearly when Lissandra's claws are behind you. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.110
 In the general situation, the most important thing you need to pay attention to is UI, followed by visual effects 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.650
 like Ability Champion and Summoner Spell. Then champions, minions, monsters, and 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.180
 lastly the battle environment itself. So basically we want you to focus on fighting 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.409
 your opponents, not the game itself. 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.769
 See a comparison between the current Rift and the latest Rift. Mesh navigation 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.298
 which determines which location you can pass, partly covered by the battle environment 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:07.880
 in the current map. 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.130
 Because now the map environment has been improved, you can more easily see passable paths, walls to skip, 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.770
 and the location to install a ward. 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 Another way we do to improve information clarity is by making it easier for players 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.020
 to find out where they are. Every location in the forest has a different theme, so your location can now be 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 seen easily. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.499
 The Baron became the cornerstone of the direction orientation, with the destruction spreading from its nest. 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:42.089
 When approaching the nest, you can see the area getting more damaged. 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.609
 For example, in the western forest, the trees here look full of energy and rock formations 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.030
 looks divided because of the existence of the Baron. 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.729
 In the eastern forest, the natural beauty of the forest is safe from its existence. 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.409
 Even though both of them are nests of blue buffs, they have a different look so you can immediately 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.630
 realize where you are. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.639
 We want Summoner's Rift to be a fun place to play together in the years to come. 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.250
 In this update, we chose a hand drawing art theme that we think will continue to evolve and evolve, 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.310
 like this game itself. 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 In terms of themes, current forest monsters are more in line with the theme in the Rift and show the level of strength 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 they are better. The Red Buff, or now called Brambleback, roared to commemorate anyone who approached 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.030
 and get ready to issue a massive attack. 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.110
 Compare it with Krugs, Monsters that look always survive and show ability 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.060
 they are in fending off attacks. 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.600
 Each forest camp also shows their personality. The Wolves Merc out of 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 nest and get ready to hunt, and Grump shows himself as a heavyweight monster. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.850
 The two team headquarters also have differences. The architecture of both is similar, but the inspiration for difference between the two 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.760
 is from animals. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.280
 The red team headquarters has an owl motif and a circle shape. 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.400
 While the blue team headquarters was inspired by a male deer in the shape of a box. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.800
 In the middle of the map, the two shapes meet and you can see the difference between the two. 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 The Red Minion carries an ax and has a curved shape, while the Blue Minion 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.660
 carry a war hammer in a checkered shape. Both these weapons and armor 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.630
 coupled with striking color differences will make them clearly distinguishable. 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.790
 For Dragon and Baron, we add magnificent elements and make their impression 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.350
 more than just an ordinary jungle monster. Look at Dragon, threatening and dangerous, he is very 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.510
 guard the area. In battle, the Dragon has finally used his Ability Points and 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.720
 his new attack shows how much power he has. 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.270
 The new Baron's appearance is the result of a combination of all his abilities and shows his prestige as a Boss 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.710
 the strongest in the Rift and show off how much damage can be caused from the attack. His moves and attack patterns 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.710
 no longer feels random and this will help both teams decide when to fight this important objective. 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.389
 Please note that this change is not perfect and we will still work on this map for a few more months. 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.620
 On PBE, we will always listen to your input while we make adjustments, clean bugs and improve 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.840
 performance. When this folder is ready to launch, you won't feel much difference in performance 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.068
 on your computer. Meanwhile, please visit the Summoner's Rift Hub where you can see 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.219
 evolution of this map. There is available Dev Blog, Frequently Asked Questions, and Patch Notes 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.960
 which will explain the latest updates. Thank you for watching this video.
