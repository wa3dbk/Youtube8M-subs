the bulb into the entire sphere and this
is<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.579> integrated<00:00:48.390> basically

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
is going to then be integrated basically

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.149 
is going to then be integrated basically
all<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> light<00:00:49.379> beams<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> be

integrated into one point in the back

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709 
integrated into one point in the back
which<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.069> measure<00:00:53.609> with<00:00:54.359> a<00:00:54.389> device

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
which we then measure with a device

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.379 
which we then measure with a device
called<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.050> spectroradiometer<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:57.210> going

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:57.389 
called a spectroradiometer that's going

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.419 
called a spectroradiometer that's going
to<00:00:57.449> measure<00:00:57.659> effectively<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> total<00:00:58.920> energy

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
to measure effectively the total energy

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.939 
to measure effectively the total energy
of<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.329> light<00:01:00.569> waves<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.199> give<00:01:01.409> us<00:01:01.499> a<00:01:01.649> total

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
of the light waves and give us a total

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.360 
of the light waves and give us a total
flux<00:01:02.850> number<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.710> measured<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
flux number which is then measured in

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.940 
flux number which is then measured in
lumens<00:01:05.780> that's<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
lumens that's how we actually get the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.970 
lumens that's how we actually get the
lumen<00:01:08.310> output<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.970> our<00:01:09.120> bulbs<00:01:09.650> most<00:01:10.650> sellers

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
lumen output of our bulbs most sellers

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.370 
lumen output of our bulbs most sellers
simply<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.640> calculated<00:01:12.330> lumen<00:01:12.660> numbers<00:01:12.960> by

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
simply use calculated lumen numbers by

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.100 
simply use calculated lumen numbers by
taking<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> lumen<00:01:14.580> figures<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.690> actual

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
taking the lumen figures of the actual

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
taking the lumen figures of the actual
individual<00:01:16.620> LEDs<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.160> manufacturer

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
individual LEDs from the manufacturer

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
individual LEDs from the manufacturer
but<00:01:18.510> this<00:01:18.630> isn't<00:01:18.840> accurate<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.250> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
but this isn't accurate because you can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
but this isn't accurate because you can
never<00:01:20.640> run<00:01:20.910> those<00:01:21.090> LEDs<00:01:21.510> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> full<00:01:22.260> amount

decrease<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.380> brightness<00:01:55.790> at<00:01:56.790> diode<00:01:57.150> dynamics

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
decrease in brightness at diode dynamics

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.030 
decrease in brightness at diode dynamics
we<00:01:57.600> always<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.110> sure<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> bulbs<00:01:58.680> are<00:01:58.740> fully

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
we always make sure the bulbs are fully

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520 
we always make sure the bulbs are fully
warm<00:01:59.370> before<00:01:59.760> testing<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.330> in<00:02:00.810> order<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.230> get

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
warm before testing them in order to get

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.890 
warm before testing them in order to get
good<00:02:01.800> results<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> bloomin<00:02:03.450> figures<00:02:03.750> from

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
good results so the bloomin figures from

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.149 
good results so the bloomin figures from
us<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.500> after<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.550> bulb<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.000> fully<00:02:06.390> heated<00:02:06.690> up

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
us are after the bulb is fully heated up

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.440 
us are after the bulb is fully heated up
now<00:02:08.159> that<00:02:08.310> we've<00:02:08.399> positioned<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.910> properly<00:02:09.330> we

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
now that we've positioned it properly we

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.580 
now that we've positioned it properly we
can<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> closed<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.350> start<00:02:10.590> measuring

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
can get it closed and start measuring

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.230 
can get it closed and start measuring
now<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> power<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> bulb<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> sphere<00:02:15.060> we

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
now to power the bulb in the sphere we

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.510 
now to power the bulb in the sphere we
have<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.840> general<00:02:15.870> DC<00:02:16.560> power<00:02:16.830> supply<00:02:17.220> here

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
have just a general DC power supply here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.120 
have just a general DC power supply here
that<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.300> set<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> constant<00:02:19.320> voltage<00:02:19.500> we

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that we can set to a constant voltage we

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000 
that we can set to a constant voltage we
have<00:02:20.330> 13.3<00:02:21.330> diode<00:02:22.140> dynamics<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.620> measure<00:02:22.800> bolt

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
have 13.3 diode dynamics we measure bolt

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.560 
have 13.3 diode dynamics we measure bolt
at<00:02:23.130> thirteen<00:02:23.490> point<00:02:23.730> two<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.270> that's<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
at thirteen point two because that's the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.050 
at thirteen point two because that's the
most<00:02:24.720> realistic<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.320> most<00:02:25.470> batteries<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.790> we

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
most realistic for most batteries but we

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
most realistic for most batteries but we
do<00:02:27.210> lose<00:02:27.390> point<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.900> volt<00:02:28.260> even<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.830> these

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
do lose point one volt even with these

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.370 
do lose point one volt even with these
heavy<00:02:29.190> gauge<00:02:29.430> wire<00:02:29.460> as<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.630> travel<00:02:31.050> into<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
heavy gauge wire as we travel into the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230 
heavy gauge wire as we travel into the
sphere<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.310> we've<00:02:32.430> got<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.670> at<00:02:32.880> thirteen

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
sphere so we've got this at thirteen

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
sphere so we've got this at thirteen
point<00:02:33.480> three<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
point three we then have it going to a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.830 
point three we then have it going to a
digital<00:02:35.340> power<00:02:35.580> meter<00:02:35.820> which<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.600> very

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
digital power meter which is very

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.820 
digital power meter which is very
precise<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:39.260> exact<00:02:40.260> current

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
precise you can see a very exact current

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.920 
precise you can see a very exact current
readout<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:42.690> we're<00:02:42.810> going

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
readout here and that's what we're going

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.290 
readout here and that's what we're going
to<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.290> feeding<00:02:43.560> into<00:02:44.070> our<00:02:44.190> software<00:02:44.790> to

determine exactly how many watts of
power<00:02:47.580> were<00:02:47.820> using<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.330> then<00:02:48.690> how<00:02:49.470> much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
power were using and then how much

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.710 
power were using and then how much
brightness<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:50.700> every<00:02:51.120> watt<00:02:51.690> of

that's running into power the bulb at

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.220 
that's running into power the bulb at
our<00:02:59.190> preset<00:02:59.610> levels<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.080> our

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
our preset levels then we have our

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
our preset levels then we have our
reference<00:03:01.500> sensor<00:03:02.220> which<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> sense

spectral radiometer properly to actually

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.890 
spectral radiometer properly to actually
get<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> light<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.060> measure<00:03:09.510> we<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
get the light to measure we have a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.020 
get the light to measure we have a
fiber-optic<00:03:10.320> cable<00:03:11.040> which<00:03:11.280> runs<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
fiber-optic cable which runs into the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.090 
fiber-optic cable which runs into the
spread<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.480> radiometer<00:03:13.110> now<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.920> this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
spread to radiometer now the way this

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
spread to radiometer now the way this
works<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.060> we're<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.360> actually

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
works is that we're going to actually

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.810 
works is that we're going to actually
measure<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.680> light<00:03:16.920> that's<00:03:17.070> coming<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.610> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
measure the light that's coming in and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.030 
measure the light that's coming in and
measure<00:03:18.330> each<00:03:18.570> individual<00:03:19.140> wavelength<00:03:19.739> or

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
measure each individual wavelength or

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.190 
measure each individual wavelength or
energy<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.940> those<00:03:21.450> photons<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.290> light<00:03:22.850> those

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
energy of those photons of light those

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.479 
energy of those photons of light those
wavelengths<00:03:25.200> dictate<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.799> color<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
wavelengths dictate the color of the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.820 
wavelengths dictate the color of the
light<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.110> integrate<00:03:28.410> each

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
light and so we can integrate each

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.240 
light and so we can integrate each
individual<00:03:30.080> photon<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.440> measure<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.130> and

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
individual photon and measure it and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490 
individual photon and measure it and
then<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> correlated<00:03:33.720> color<00:03:33.750> temperature

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
then get a correlated color temperature

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.050 
then get a correlated color temperature
which<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.739> going<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> tell<00:03:35.100> us<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.489> exact

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
which is going to tell us the exact

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.630 
which is going to tell us the exact
color<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.560> bulb<00:03:37.769> whether<00:03:38.040> that's<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> cool

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
color of the bulb whether that's a cool

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.330 
color of the bulb whether that's a cool
white<00:03:38.910> warm<00:03:39.540> white<00:03:39.780> or<00:03:39.989> just<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.530> red<00:03:40.739> or<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> blue

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
white warm white or just a red or a blue

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.940 
white warm white or just a red or a blue
it'll<00:03:42.299> tell<00:03:42.510> us<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.900> along<00:03:43.380> with<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.739> total

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
it'll tell us that along with the total

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.729 
it'll tell us that along with the total
energy<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:45.120> total<00:03:45.299> brightness<00:03:45.630> measured<00:03:46.620> in

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
energy the total brightness measured in

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.560 
energy the total brightness measured in
lumens<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.459> let's<00:03:48.030> take<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> look<00:03:48.450> at<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
lumens so let's take a look at the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.410 
lumens so let's take a look at the
software<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:49.880> oK<00:03:50.880> we've<00:03:51.030> taken<00:03:51.269> a

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
software now oK we've taken a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.120 
software now oK we've taken a
measurement<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.959> bulb<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.650> first<00:03:52.920> big

thing<00:03:53.310> you'll<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.060> our<00:03:54.150> spectrum

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
thing you'll see here is our spectrum

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.660 
thing you'll see here is our spectrum
distribution<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:55.980> actually<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:56.519> the

are actually blue with a layer to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.220 
are actually blue with a layer to
convert<00:04:05.910> some<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.420> light<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.570> yellow<00:04:07.049> you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
convert some of the light to yellow you

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.990 
convert some of the light to yellow you
combine<00:04:07.799> blue<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.250> yellow<00:04:08.340> together<00:04:08.730> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
combine blue and yellow together and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880 
combine blue and yellow together and
ends<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.570> looking<00:04:09.660> white<00:04:10.049> that's<00:04:10.470> why<00:04:10.620> we<00:04:10.739> have

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
ends up looking white that's why we have

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.130 
ends up looking white that's why we have
a<00:04:10.920> big<00:04:11.190> blue<00:04:11.549> peak<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> bunch<00:04:12.989> of

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
a big blue peak and then a bunch of

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.229 
a big blue peak and then a bunch of
yellow<00:04:13.320> light<00:04:13.590> as<00:04:13.709> well<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.880> our<00:04:14.970> total

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
yellow light as well this is our total

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.690 
yellow light as well this is our total
distribution<00:04:15.989> now<00:04:16.500> combining<00:04:17.280> all<00:04:17.519> this

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
distribution now combining all this

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.240 
distribution now combining all this
together<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.720> plotting<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.799> we<00:04:19.919> can<00:04:20.039> get<00:04:20.160> our

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
case 58 92 K exactly so about

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.790 
case 58 92 K exactly so about
900k<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.870> that's<00:04:28.080> how<00:04:28.229> we<00:04:28.289> want<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.650> make<00:04:28.770> sure

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
900k so that's how we want to make sure

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.770 
900k so that's how we want to make sure
that<00:04:29.250> all<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.759> bulbs<00:04:30.030> from<00:04:30.150> dive<00:04:30.330> dynamics

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
that all of the bulbs from dive dynamics

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.540

are<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> same<00:04:31.169> color<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.949> is<00:04:32.130> actually<00:04:32.430> one

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
are the same color this is actually one

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.969 
are the same color this is actually one
of<00:04:32.580> our<00:04:32.729> competitors<00:04:33.240> bulbs<00:04:33.690> an<00:04:33.810> H<00:04:34.050> 11<00:04:34.530> 80<00:04:34.740> watt

style bulb which you might have seen in
a<00:04:36.539> previous<00:04:36.900> video<00:04:37.139> we're<00:04:38.130> just<00:04:38.160> using<00:04:38.400> an

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
a previous video we're just using an

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.629 
a previous video we're just using an
example<00:04:39.060> here<00:04:39.289> by<00:04:40.289> getting<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> total<00:04:41.160> energy

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
example here by getting the total energy

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.180 
example here by getting the total energy
of<00:04:41.750> all<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.780> these<00:04:43.110> different<00:04:43.169> colors<00:04:43.710> and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
of all of these different colors and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.640 
of all of these different colors and
combining<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> we<00:04:45.360> can<00:04:45.479> get<00:04:45.599> our<00:04:45.720> total<00:04:46.139> flux

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
combining it we can get our total flux

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.650 
combining it we can get our total flux
number<00:04:47.130> which<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.669> measured<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.060> lumens<00:04:48.240> in

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
number which is measured in lumens in

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.950 
number which is measured in lumens in
this<00:04:49.110> case<00:04:49.349> we<00:04:49.560> have<00:04:49.849> 163<00:04:50.849> lumens<00:04:51.569> for<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
this case we have 163 lumens for this

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.939 
this case we have 163 lumens for this
bulb<00:04:52.819> now<00:04:54.169> final<00:04:55.169> thing<00:04:55.319> we<00:04:55.410> look<00:04:55.560> at<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
bulb now final thing we look at is the

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.279 
bulb now final thing we look at is the
electric<00:04:56.370> parameters<00:04:56.849> we<00:04:57.300> input<00:04:57.720> our<00:04:57.750> current

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
electric parameters we input our current

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.700 
electric parameters we input our current
and<00:04:58.610> wattage<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.909> then<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:00.960> take<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.500> total

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
and wattage and then we take the total

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.559 
and wattage and then we take the total
flux<00:05:02.099> divided<00:05:02.880> by<00:05:03.060> watts

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
flux divided by watts

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.809 
flux divided by watts
to<00:05:03.750> get<00:05:03.900> our<00:05:03.990> efficacy<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.190> this<00:05:05.340> bulb<00:05:05.610> is

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
to get our efficacy so this bulb is

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.480 
to get our efficacy so this bulb is
making<00:05:06.180> 66<00:05:06.900> lumens<00:05:07.349> for<00:05:07.770> every<00:05:08.039> watt<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.340> power
