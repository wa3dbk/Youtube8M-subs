00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.740
 Cooking is because you are in the overview 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.550
 chocolate that's the chocolate couple 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.860
 Let's go with the only cups 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 carbohydrates that we always eat like this 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.559
 potatoes in oatmeal these are two 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 different pack because that once here 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 out in the net and dream 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 Wedel is and rice and stuff like dogs 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 So no longer really not 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.560
 actually technically vegetables have at 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.370
 one here so a broccoli in 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.530
 fresh and frozen kaiserwiese have there 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:14.550
 we become masters or nature broccoli 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:17.920
 Deep fell quite massive form in the week 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.610
 straight paprika i like the red one 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 little and two europas with it 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.300
 we have some for the potatoes and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.770
 then we have quite a lot 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.500
 brought milk products once and indeed 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 asked a lot of ma because we are the same 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 once use as a tip with 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.360
 chive perpetrators are me but synonymous 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.070
 Because every morning I have my friend 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.300
 is always here this kalinka you go 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.369
 so close to plain kefir cream cheese 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 that sometimes happens in the evening in sauces 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:12.370
 So in our music almost fresh ps 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.190
 I almost over 1 every day 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 that's why it's pretty much and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.210
 pancakes and so I also often with 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 grained cream cheese and then botch 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.260
 It's pretty fast 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 Little stuff here and we do not buy 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.710
 actually no longer so wants 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.960
 just do not use milk anymore 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.910
 We'll use water and water 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.330
 Coffee I drink meanwhile, too 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.830
 that's why they 're black 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.740
 our milk products we always 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.260
 then we get here once 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.510
 Help chicken even more 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.190
 that's aldi lidl on the outside and why net 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.110
 that's actually called aldi 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:11.360
 bones totally alike takes salmon ham 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:16.890
 all 4 1 is the Polak from the from 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.830
 veedel so yes that's the 1 80 percent 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.300
 have chocolate from the net already here 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.060
 maybe from time to time I mentioned that 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.290
 that very much and like to eat and yes 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.570
 Meanwhile, I think so again 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.820
 Yummy I think I should change 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:39.290
 on one million percent chocolate 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.590
 then at the fruit front who here no 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.050
 give 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.810
 in his bile big pack could 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.380
 I really want 10 of why 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.380
 we have no goals 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:05.269
 half time and not 30 vdc 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.269
 we have them too 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.460
 otherwise we use that too much 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.940
 in the evening to make such as 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.979
 example very very good times 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.370
 clean and then we have, of course 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:44.160
 even better, everything can be left natural 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:50.630
 and not something salt and whatever else one 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.630
 Munch almonds in groove and walk 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.980
 O 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.300
 so for the first view I take 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:52.330
 just a bit of cream cheese is league 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.330
 and mr parsley chives 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.919
 just do the whole pack now 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:19.720
 purely because it tastes so delicious 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:23.069
 now even so now there is only 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.669
 So locally or places just 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.669
 Apocalypse actually works
