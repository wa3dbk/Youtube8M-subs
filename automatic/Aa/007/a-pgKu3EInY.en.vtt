00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
than most boosts and it didn't really

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.759 
than most boosts and it didn't really
bother<00:04:01.760> me<00:04:01.969> totally<00:04:02.629> even<00:04:02.989> with<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.260> gain<00:04:03.469> I

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
bother me totally even with the gain I

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.410 
bother me totally even with the gain I
never<00:04:04.280> even<00:04:04.430> did<00:04:04.640> push<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.030> all<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.209> way<00:04:05.329> up

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
never even did push it all the way up

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.059 
never even did push it all the way up
because<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:06.109> didn't<00:04:06.409> have<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:06.980> was

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
because I just didn't have to it was

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.789 
because I just didn't have to it was
loud<00:04:07.340> enough<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.640> way<00:04:07.879> it<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.470> EQ<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.530> could

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
loud enough the way it was EQ I could

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.979 
loud enough the way it was EQ I could
take<00:04:10.010> it<00:04:10.159> or<00:04:10.280> leave<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.489> seemed<00:04:11.299> kind<00:04:11.689> of<00:04:11.810> neat

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
take it or leave it seemed kind of neat

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.710 
take it or leave it seemed kind of neat
for<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.470> clean<00:04:12.769> type<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.730> signal<00:04:14.120> with<00:04:14.329> a<00:04:14.390> little

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
for a clean type of signal with a little

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.900 
for a clean type of signal with a little
bit<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.870> dirt<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.439> course<00:04:15.769> but<00:04:16.579> with<00:04:16.789> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
bit of dirt of course but with the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.330 
bit of dirt of course but with the
Luther<00:04:17.239> Drive<00:04:17.509> the<00:04:17.900> EQ<00:04:18.560> didn't<00:04:19.039> really

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
Luther Drive the EQ didn't really

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.670 
Luther Drive the EQ didn't really
enhance<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.239> Luther<00:04:20.720> at<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.470> boost

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
enhance the Luther at all but the boost

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.430 
enhance the Luther at all but the boost
sure<00:04:22.070> did<00:04:22.340> very<00:04:23.210> cool<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.960> spent<00:04:24.289> some

sure did very cool and it spent some

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.129
