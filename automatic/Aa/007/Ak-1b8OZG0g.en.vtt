by 5 by 5 by 5 tutorial they're all

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.700 
by 5 by 5 by 5 tutorial they're all
they're<00:00:37.999> all<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.239> things<00:00:38.510> I've<00:00:38.780> already<00:00:39.469> done

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
they're all the things I've already done

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.430 
they're all the things I've already done
but<00:00:40.280> um<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:41.089> isn't<00:00:41.539> necessarily<00:00:41.989> Rubik's

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
but um this isn't necessarily Rubik's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.489 
but um this isn't necessarily Rubik's
Cube<00:00:42.679> but<00:00:43.039> it's<00:00:43.249> a<00:00:43.339> human<00:00:43.670> can<00:00:43.819> do<00:00:43.999> so<00:00:44.839> I'm

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
Cube but it's a human can do so I'm

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.979 
Cube but it's a human can do so I'm
going<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.800> teach<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.339> today<00:00:46.780> there's<00:00:47.780> no

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
going to teach you that today there's no

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.239 
going to teach you that today there's no
move<00:00:48.350> notation<00:00:49.129> on<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:49.460> either<00:00:51.069> this<00:00:52.069> is

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
move notation on this either this is

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.430 
move notation on this either this is
really<00:00:52.550> easy<00:00:52.609> I'm<00:00:53.089> little<00:00:53.449> I'm<00:00:53.899> teaching<00:00:54.319> you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
really easy I'm little I'm teaching you

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.869 
really easy I'm little I'm teaching you
this<00:00:54.649> in<00:00:54.859> one<00:00:55.069> take<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:55.609> is<00:00:55.760> one<00:00:55.969> video<00:00:56.210> so

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
this in one take this is one video so

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.110 
this in one take this is one video so
let's<00:00:58.879> get<00:00:59.059> started<00:00:59.659> so<00:01:00.489> if<00:01:01.489> your<00:01:01.670> cube<00:01:01.969> is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
let's get started so if your cube is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.660 
let's get started so if your cube is
like<00:01:02.329> this<00:01:02.659> you<00:01:03.469> notice<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:04.040> there's<00:01:04.309> black

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
like this you notice that there's black

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.900 
like this you notice that there's black
and<00:01:04.879> white<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:06.170> as<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:07.400> see<00:01:07.550> might<00:01:07.760> have

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
and white so as you see might have

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.910 
and white so as you see might have
instead<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.540> black<00:01:08.780> green<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.590> doesn't

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
instead of black green that doesn't

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.630 
instead of black green that doesn't
matter<00:01:10.100> at<00:01:10.730> all<00:01:11.170> when<00:01:12.170> you're<00:01:12.410> you<00:01:13.280> have<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.550> be

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
matter at all when you're you have to be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760 
matter at all when you're you have to be
very<00:01:13.850> careful<00:01:14.480> when<00:01:14.660> you're<00:01:14.870> dissembling

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
very careful when you're dissembling

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.150 
very careful when you're dissembling
this<00:01:16.510> you<00:01:17.510> sort<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.810> do<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.170> lightweight<00:01:18.470> and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
this you sort of do it lightweight and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.700 
this you sort of do it lightweight and
what<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.430> need<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.670> do<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.150> get<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.990> random<00:01:21.290> end

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
what you need to do is get a random end

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.820 
what you need to do is get a random end
just<00:01:22.370> any<00:01:22.790> end<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.540> then<00:01:23.810> do<00:01:24.080> an<00:01:24.230> up<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.680> down

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
just any end and then do an up and down

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.580 
just any end and then do an up and down
motion<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.970> going<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.240> be<00:01:26.330> up<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:27.470> this

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
motion so this is going to be up so this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.960 
motion so this is going to be up so this
is<00:01:27.650> gonna<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.830> down<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:29.630> down<00:01:30.610> need<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.730> keep

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
is gonna be down up down need to keep

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.290 
is gonna be down up down need to keep
doing<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.040> let's<00:01:34.040> start<00:01:34.160> so<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:36.940> is<00:01:37.940> what

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
doing this let's start so that is what

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.850 
doing this let's start so that is what
you<00:01:38.450> should<00:01:38.480> have<00:01:39.460> now<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:42.380> need<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.650> look

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
you should have now so you need to look

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.530 
you should have now so you need to look
for<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.220> end<00:01:43.840> which<00:01:44.840> has<00:01:45.160> three<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:46.610> then<00:01:46.940> one

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
for the end which has three and then one

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.860 
for the end which has three and then one
so<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:49.340> here<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.630> we<00:01:50.780> can

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
so this is this one here so that we can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.750 
so this is this one here so that we can
see<00:01:51.080> there's<00:01:51.410> three<00:01:51.620> one<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.640> end

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
see there's three one so this is the end

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.140 
see there's three one so this is the end
we're<00:01:52.880> going<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.090> start<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.760> just<00:01:56.030> need

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
we're going to start on so you just need

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.140 
we're going to start on so you just need
to<00:01:56.300> remember<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.900> sort<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.710> little<00:01:58.160> pattern

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
to remember this sort of little pattern

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.780 
to remember this sort of little pattern
thing<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.840> need<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.159> what<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.550> need<00:02:01.640> to

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
thing so you need to so what you need to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.750 
thing so you need to so what you need to
do<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.570> need<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> line<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.650> up<00:02:03.920> there<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.490> it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
do is you need to line it up there so it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.120 
do is you need to line it up there so it
turns<00:02:05.000> around<00:02:05.120> there<00:02:05.480> then<00:02:06.020> make<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.500> center

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
turns around there then make the center

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.280 
turns around there then make the center
layer<00:02:07.370> like<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:10.190> move<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.909> down

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
layer like this and then move it down

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.149 
layer like this and then move it down
like<00:02:12.680> here<00:02:13.569> then<00:02:14.569> remove<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.900> round<00:02:15.379> just<00:02:15.980> like

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
like here then remove it round just like

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:22.330 
like here then remove it round just like
this<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.920> remove<00:02:19.159> it<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.760> we're<00:02:20.689> doing<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
this then remove it so we're doing that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.890 
this then remove it so we're doing that
outside<00:02:22.610> layer<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.569> need<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.250> then

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
outside layer so we need to do that then

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.190 
outside layer so we need to do that then
round<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:29.060> need<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.560> make<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:31.629> 4x4<00:02:32.629> 2<00:02:32.989> by<00:02:33.140> 2

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
round here we need to make a 4x4 2 by 2

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.550 
round here we need to make a 4x4 2 by 2
block<00:02:33.620> there<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.310> then<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:36.200> should<00:02:36.379> be<00:02:36.409> one

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
block there and then there should be one

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.210 
block there and then there should be one
sticking<00:02:37.069> out<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:37.579> put<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.109> 3<00:02:39.859> up

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
sticking out there put that as a 3 up

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.349 
sticking out there put that as a 3 up
and<00:02:43.239> then<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:45.440> round<00:02:45.709> there<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.909> that<00:02:47.090> there

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
and then that round there put that there

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.140 
and then that round there put that there
and<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.349> put<00:02:48.829> in<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> cube

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and you have put in a cube

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.479 
and you have put in a cube
you<00:02:50.810> should<00:02:51.019> think<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.500> are<00:02:51.769> once<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.340> have

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
you should think you are once you have

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.300 
you should think you are once you have
done<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:52.970> should<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.629> getting<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.310> once

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
done this you should be getting it once

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.619 
done this you should be getting it once
you're<00:02:55.519> up<00:02:55.639> to<00:02:55.790> speed<00:02:55.879> you<00:02:56.150> need<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.420> keep

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
you're up to speed you need to keep

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.099 
you're up to speed you need to keep
doing<00:02:57.109> this<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:59.299> need<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.599> keep<00:02:59.720> doing<00:03:00.019> this

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
doing this you need to keep doing this

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.539 
doing this you need to keep doing this
over<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.560> over<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.889> over<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.220> over<00:03:01.310> again

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
over and over and over and over again

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.509 
over and over and over and over again
until<00:03:01.819> you're<00:03:02.720> very<00:03:03.349> confident<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.370> and

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
until you're very confident with it and

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.979 
until you're very confident with it and
then<00:03:04.639> you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.879> do<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.239> your<00:03:05.329> own<00:03:05.389> you<00:03:05.810> just

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
then you can do it on your own you just

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.720 
then you can do it on your own you just
need<00:03:06.139> to<00:03:06.230> remember<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.709> pattern<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.579> should

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
need to remember this pattern you should

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.410 
need to remember this pattern you should
get<00:03:07.879> it<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.060> probably<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.450> day<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:10.389> you<00:03:11.389> should

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
get it in probably a day and you should

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.849 
get it in probably a day and you should
probably<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:13.340> able<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.849> solve<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.930> between<00:03:15.379> 5

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
probably be able to solve it between 5

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.129 
probably be able to solve it between 5
and<00:03:16.129> 10<00:03:16.340> seconds<00:03:16.879> once<00:03:17.150> you're<00:03:17.299> up<00:03:17.419> to<00:03:17.449> speed

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
and 10 seconds once you're up to speed

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.990 
and 10 seconds once you're up to speed

cube<00:03:26.750> stop-motion<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.739> at<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.220> end<00:03:28.310> of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
cube stop-motion I do at the end of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.920 
cube stop-motion I do at the end of
every<00:03:28.849> video<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.449> I<00:03:29.690> makes<00:03:30.109> every<00:03:30.590> tutorial

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
every video that I makes every tutorial

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770 
every video that I makes every tutorial
so<00:03:32.930> at<00:03:33.199> the<00:03:33.440> start<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.889> said<00:03:34.129> you<00:03:34.459> can<00:03:34.780> check
