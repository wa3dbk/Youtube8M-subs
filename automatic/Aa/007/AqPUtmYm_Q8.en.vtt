 wifi oil 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.360
 god and opening matchday not in't 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.620
 win wifi on look their 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 no test was successful yet 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 no I had a fan here at school 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.750
 thought of the game but oh, me 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.710
 then we might not think so 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 best and the inside was that he 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 maybe afges get better though 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.869
 think we are killing after being good at it 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.420
 competition are also artie de 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 competition and also delicious to be very stubborn 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 as an alien and also has a lot 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.430
 trust and the sangha can game it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.250
 walk white ring 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.420
 I assume that the way it is 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 we won now loved a girlfriend 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 are very content find that much 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 stood there has been noted with me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.780
 because we are having a hard time this week 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.079
 weeks have to go to cousin and we have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 then there will be Sunday next week 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 do not run the risk through equity 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.059
 have two walk in the Netherlands because then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.410
 you are a little less belly of the van 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 the ranking 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.949
 model today the first edition of one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.329
 lure a little fall but then we have 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.670
 I think well restored the score one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.989
 second quarter strong toes of third 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 quartile we just had to reverse a bit 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 for the rest 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 but we we open it must score against 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.460
 a guess that we were very real then yes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 good time the had him but that we 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 actually played football and that we are deep 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.040
 We depend on that we created opportunities we created 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.659
 come on a 4 and yes then it is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 actually you have conquered complete 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 control over the much team is going well 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 and you as a player then pass that red card 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.880
 from then you are one in the me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.619
 looking again for your organization 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 because I needed while players to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.530
 to win here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 indeed already playful what you need to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.040
 could win and made of it 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.579
 sammy bullshit that leads back one anyway 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.869
 glossy role for yo from and the try 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 every one of mine was my best too 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.729
 do and give my hands percent 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.079
 and at the moments to see it as one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 mine killed him 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.439
 and today it is difficult though 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 I also have a photo and warmer than that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.220
 I have it on good reacts 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 cups were not just where the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.290
 value back up and because we go through 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.450
 it then earns your thumb or make the 313 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.829
 do so here I have experienced machines 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.910
 so the observed meskes had none 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.540

 at the top of the me in the ranking 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.520
 play a very how football we already have 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.950
 I think we had four penalties 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.250
 We already have why I am harder 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.050

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.660
 almost the shadow side that we are anyway 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.430
 some salt 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.940
 experience about the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.880
 Russia is until a separate country will be there 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.920
 You also become someone like us again 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.090

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.230
 nice experience but we call it 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.520
 there may also be something too secretly 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.350
 pick up I know the rat has such a ship 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.480
 would be hard toes against very good ones 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.130
 team where you ok maybe maybe one 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.170
 underestimation starts but we see that 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.640
 still there are a lot of drive and 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.110
 the team why why 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.550
 yes not only to confirm but also 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.650
 have a lot of fun in it 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.260
 irradiating footballs I do that from we 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.060
 we we go wherever we go play 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.440

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.550
 big compliment to the team that 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.930
 reasonable 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.150
 yes, that finally radiates to us 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.950
 I do n't think I can really figure that out in much 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.910
 blasting that was on henk and yes then 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.910
