00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello welcome to the weekend 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 weather with the views on youtube 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.630
 size each other youtube greet god 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.190
 weather it is not continuous throughout 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.690
 gray, however, is already 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.240
 the basic topic is the next days 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.470
 probably until about 23 october about 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 after rees is then open 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 many clouds little sun and always 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.170
 again also rain from the partie 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.060
 there are always in between 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 a few days a day 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 are for example in the friendlier 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.599
 southern bavaria sunday now then 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 So tomorrow or today after you have them 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 probably watch some more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.520
 as an eight-hour sun direction 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 alps rand 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 However, these are always the exception 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.809
 vienna eastern austria also general 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 always a bit friendlier 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 the temperatures are also tending 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 he was already in the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 last days always the northern one 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 German moment now double digits 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 Temperatures in the south even the colder 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.230
 air there that will become generally like that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 a call up to the highest 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 temperature range mostly between 10 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.030
 and 15 degrees 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.040
 31 have on the gray and big ones 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.540
 areas much less now ship without 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.000
 between breaks 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.820
 However, the winter in the mountains 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 must now again as you try the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 rest has 1500 meters is the whole because 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.530
 relatively quickly back away as it is now 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.259
 but typically warmer become active 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.270
 the question is how long this now 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 actually this heat stays warm 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 I also want to warmth in between 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.200
 again i want to say that again 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 take what the media-theme 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.650
 winter and so on and so forth 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.570
 it is normal for it to be in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.280
 garmisch-partenkirchen in october 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 snowing it is normal it is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.540
 average ok I leave it already 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 again something is important 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.549
 will be back from the 23 october are again 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.290
 at least a few signals because that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.780
 winter could come again 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.189
 that would be normal then normal 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 then at the end of October 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.689
 and whatever I wanted to say to him 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 There is a great reportage about it 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.619
 the sad death of three storm chasers 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.780
 at the tornado tornado tornado by rhino 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 on 31 march 2013 many have 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.920
 asked 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.600
 how can that happen that three? 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.360
 experienced storm chasers are dead 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.590
 and really have it all in one 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.950
 I almost have to climb an unprecedented mountain 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.630
 say science journalism 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.950
 reporter the denver post now 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.840
 wrote 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.209
 it is worth reading this i have the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.550
 link to it is on facebook 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.830
 Tachelmann weather or yorker you need 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.050
 watch it yourself or twitter j 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.330
 Kachelmann really underlined 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.060
 great science journalism pity 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.680
 that it's in German-speaking countries 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.480
 hardly until not so much is here 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.920
 one prepares everybody presumably 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.150
 again on the next flash ice 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.269
 Slip in winter snow chaos 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 Reportings 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.290
 it's a shame because we have one 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 also many exciting things about the man 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.209
 could and should report in the art 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.910
 as the denver post has done to them 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.420
 a nice weekend for god and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.420
 refute meter long
