00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.970
 &gt;&gt; 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.600
 Uyghur: Anna. Kasparian &gt;&gt;: Yes? 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.130
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: What is the latest on Lino vs. Conan? 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.070
 ANA &gt;&gt;: Well. First of all they are both going on their own TV programs which you are 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.940
 Every little bit to take stabs each other, right? Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes. 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.289
 Casparian &gt;&gt;: Lino stabs are weak sauce, funny and lame, right? But Conan stabs 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.230
 A little funny. Uygur &gt;&gt;: I want to do both. I want to let 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.199
 The public decides. Kasparian &gt;&gt; Well. 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.929
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Well. First up, he is gay. Kasparian &gt;&gt;: Ha, ha, ha. 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.279
 Uygur &gt;&gt;: It's terrible. Everyone does gay tone. Everyone can do one, it seems 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.180
 except me. All right, so you Lino chase another little man. Let's watch. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.080
 Leno &gt;&gt;: Critics of the war have stopped referring to it as another Vietnam, they do not call 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.480
 No more. The bad news, they are now calling NBC another, this is recorded. welcome to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.390
 NBC, the American family TV most dysfunctional, huh? Thank you so much. Well, no one knows 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.600
 what happens. If Conan O'Brien understands, he will be very upset. He had a day statement 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.540
 Yesterday said paper and Conan "NBC has given him only seven months to make his work show." 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.119
 When I heard that, seven months, how does this agreement get? We got only four. Dave, who is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.119
 His agent? This guy gets me. I'll have the seven. Well, all the late night hosts I encountered 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 Great fun with this disaster. Last night Jamie Kimmel did not show, as some wore clothes for me. 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 Turned out that clip, here is the dress like me. Kimmel &gt;&gt; My name is Jay Leno, let it 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.790
 By this I know that I was showing more in all late at night. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.740
 Well &gt;&gt;. Lino &gt;&gt; Let's see what we have on the exit 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.540
 Local News is late. Rick, Tonya. Tonya &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Jay. After checkout 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.909
 Exhibition of Jay Leno. The NFL player suffers his 17th concussion and is forced to become 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 NBC Executive. We have all the details. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes. I mean, I got to be honest 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.510
 Based on the second watch I swear I want [unclear]. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.420
 &gt;&gt; And, right from the beginning. Everything is there, you know, to describe it as another 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 Vietnam they call it another NBC. But that did not make any sense. It's like ... 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.190
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes, I saw that joke coming from almost a mile and he wanted to stop 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.579
 It like no, no, no, no no, do not say NBC, ah, I told him. 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.680
 Funny &gt;&gt; Her, you know, here is the title about they're taking shots on each other 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.320
 The one joke they use in it is the reference which, you know, they - how they got 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560
 Which deal with seven months, got only four. Uygur &gt;&gt;: Hey. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.569
 This is not &gt;&gt; really a fire on Conan. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: I agree. I agree. 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.040
 In fact &gt;&gt;, this is not a bullet at all, this is actually a line I kind of like. I 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.890
 This thought, this is at least a joke. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes. It's a little unfair to say 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.170
 Lino to happen after Conan. But Conan is waiting for anything to go after 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.569
 Lino Lino because what lies about her - he's making jokes and NBC does not mind Lino, 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.950
 is not it? It's just - he's getting a big deal here. Well, he'd rather get canceled 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 'Gettin walked out the door, he get a show tonight again - he always wanted to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.660
 View the night again. So he pretends to be aggrieved when he is not at all hurt. 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.150
 &gt;&gt; No, he's not hurt at all. What is incredibly false and incredible about Jay Leno, was not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.030
 When false-got-a-look, we're not - and that's not - we're not - these are not six years old 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.890
 Everyone gets an equal amount of ice cream and the person who does not get equal 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.160
 The amount gets to cry about it. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: True. 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 &gt;&gt; This means, these are adults and not one as Conan said in his wonderful statement, 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.709
 You know, do not shed tears for me, to cry out loud. 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.980
 Uighur &gt;&gt;: Right, right. "But this year I have been embarrassed 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 Status. So I have to reply. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: True. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.110
 So no one &gt;&gt; needs to hold anyone's hand. But what can not do Lino, what is deceptive 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.010
 Which I think seems to me is deceitful and unauthentic and I think its a hit, 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.379
 To a great extent universally everyone who cares about this, is when it comes out 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.319
 There after all this happens and say, you know, I mean - you know, they're screwing 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.160
 To me, they're screwing Conan, Conan means poor - like Jay did not sit there and this did not happen 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.140
 For Jay. He said this happened. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes. 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.690
 Work took &gt;&gt; and Konan. Conan got the job, promised it, did it for seven months in 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.020
 Ratings went down partly due to Jay's offer. 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.640
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes. And then &gt;&gt;, now, is not bound to Jay 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.800
 Let Conan keep this work, by no means. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Right 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.260
 &gt;&gt; What I need to say is, yes, it looks like this did not work for me and these guys care about me 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.040
 Like this work again, it does not do it well, I hate to drive out a guy like Conan. he did not do 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.620
 You even need to say that much. He just needs to say Hey, we're all adults, it's really 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.360
 My ratings were competitive and better I want this post again and I can not wait to start 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.760
 Broadcast at 11:30 am to America and guess what? Conan will be fine. But acting like 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.650
 You care about Conan, acting like Dave cares about 1993 that was what - you 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.760
 You know, when you read the shift late, Jay is a schever, he's a conspirator and then, he's like 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.670
 "Oh, no, I'm every man, I'm George Bush, everyone loves me, and have Odules; I'm great!" 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.840
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes, that's what everyone's nerves get. 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.990
 Yes &gt;&gt;. Yeah. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: So now let's go to Conan, go 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.750
 After Jay Leno a little and he did not go after him a bit here. So let's watch. 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.350
 &gt;&gt; O'Brien: You know, I'm trying very hard to stay here positive. I want to say 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.510
 You something. This is sincere. Hosting the night show was a fulfillment of a long life 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.540
 A dream for me. I just want to tell the kids there watching, you can do anything 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.400
 You want to live - yes, unless Jay Leno wants to do it too. You're still using it? Because 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.930
 I can now look at [unclear]. GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: You are having a good time sticking 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.139
 For NBC is not you? &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Oh, no, no, I just stay here 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:07.570
 Have a good time. This is all I. .. GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: they did - they did. They deserve it 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.820
 that. But I say this. &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Yes. 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: I think I must plug all my stuff right now if you just take you out of the air 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.420
 Such as Mike Davis. &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Done. 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.630
 GERVAIS &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? &gt;&gt; O'Brien: You'll find something to do. I 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.310
 Certainly. GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: Oh, really? 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.199
 &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Yes. GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: Well. 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.740
 &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Yes. GERVAIS &gt;&gt; You know I'm really worried about 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.220
 So, because I saw that the effort was great. &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Yes. 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.870
 GERVAIS &gt;&gt; I feel for you. I'm just thinking ... &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Yeah. 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.360
 GERVAIS &gt;&gt;: ... you know, I've been dealing with you badly, but what I did - you got any noticeable, 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.400
 I'm not being funny this is - this is ... &gt;&gt; O'Brien: Sure, of course, yes, yes. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.050
 GERVAIS &gt;&gt; You've got any noticeable skill. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Ricky Gervais is very funny. 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.979
 On the night &gt;&gt; Letterman, Ricky Gervais said it - said our dear friend Ricky Gervais 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.970
 Golden Globe will be hosted by Le Jai lets him. 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.919
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: This is what Letterman said. This is Lehrman &gt;&gt; Tonight. 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.020
 Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Well, that's cool. Now, by the way, why did the numbers go to Conan because 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.330
 Of Lino is what Ben said, because the number of Lino was so bad that news programs 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.120
 Then he also had bad ratings resulting in poor ratings for Conan because 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.169
 All that threads down in the way that TV. Conan That ... 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.660
 Now &gt;&gt;, it came, I mean I suspected some par game. At this point, Lino will do better 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.610
 From Conan. I mean this is simple. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: Yes, because it happens to get us 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.660
 Every public return, people use it and so on. 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.009
 Yes &gt;&gt;. Uyghur &gt;&gt;: So I get a NBCs decision on it - at 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:21.479
 This expression.
