00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.220
 we 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 Moth 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.539
 Established in 2001 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.499
 All the directors who surround us progress at valuable speed 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.509
 doing 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.840
 The big problem about the speedup even in the railway 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.370
 It has been taken as 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.250
 By the appearance of this word does not start 560 between Tokyo and Osaka 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 What can be done is a great progress for long-term railways 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.220
 Let's talk 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.510
 Morning The first step of going up and down leaving Tokyo and Osaka 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.989
 Each after lunch 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.070
 I will arrive at the terminal station 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.110
 And I will leave again in the evening and return on that day 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 So far, 4 companies could only run one way a day 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.360
 You can make it bigger as it is, so there are 2 trains 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 It became usable for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340
 In this way the railway gives speeding up 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.210
 I made an effort but I said faster and safer 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 Let's do the term by continuing the book forever 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.220
 So how can you speed up 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 Is not it 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 So the first problem is to gradually increase the speed of the train 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.220
 Power of work 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 In other words, build acceleration performance 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.159
 As you see in the electric locomotive, you bring the country's motta and the author 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.540
 I'm pulling 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.229
 In Kodama there are also 16 mochi songs 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.779
 Sobe world is also made light, so the power to accelerate is also stronger 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 You can also do xp 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.569
 The second problem is that even if the speed gets higher 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.659
 It is necessary that the wheels run stably 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.359
 When the U.S. military operation wheels run, they run swaying left and right 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.269
 Live if you are released to one side in a curve 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.529
 Power to use often 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.059
 In other words, we will do our best 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.259
 This buildup has grown to some extent or more 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.619
 There is a risk of defeating the worries of the first game 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.459
 In order to eliminate such anxiety, vehicle structure koots 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.670
 You must devise to reduce the structure of send 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 Need to be durable 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.599
 There was a turbulent up coming February in several countries 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.620
 Two types of three 67 mm 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.700
 We made various efforts to improve the judgment 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.099
 Even if 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.169
 After all it becomes a key of foreign countries, one thousand four hundred thirty-five millimeters 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.039
 Meters too 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.199
 As you can see in the mobile broadcast, the stability is absolutely 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.629
 It gets worse 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.970
 Also, because the distance between the wheels is narrow 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 To build a powerful farmhouse compared to a plane 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.699
 Can not 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
 It is difficult to get high speed 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.839
 The third thing to think about 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.139
 Especially in the case of trains etc. 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.209
 Prices soar when it comes to doing something else 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.680
 By the way, it is a problem whether you will not leave the former managing director 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.709
 The fourth problem is that there are many cards in the current three 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 Poor outlook 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:21.539
 There are also many level crossings and I run at high speed in the association 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.550
 If you apply the brakes, stop as soon as possible. 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.550
 Must be 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.179
 That requires especially good braking performance 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.139
 No matter how fast you can run at the end 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.330
 It's your comfort when you rattle and make a light sound 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.050
 I can not travel, which means the ride is an issue 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.240
 Country-by-country research on such various issues 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.059
 I made a whole Kodama doing 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:04.379
 Various vehicle performance recovers 160 kilometers apart 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.569
 It is done like
