00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.179
 if you can't do this or like this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.340
 you probably come across every day 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.859
 parking problem in his yard and on 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.920
 city ​​roads parking violation 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.619
 and is fraught with consequences to help and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.619
 motorists created parktronics 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:39.870
 for the conditions of the conditions big cow us 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.140
 territory of residence and work and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.629
 feelings says car installation 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.649
 unless of course there is a desire whole and not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.300
 saw burgo and car doors 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 The principle of operation of the equipment is based on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.800
 using ultrasound 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.899
 simple and reliable and parktronic takes into account 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 airborne sound velocity 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.430
 and measures the time between radiation 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.380
 sound pulses in a given 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 direction and signal reception 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 if the parcel meets on its way 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.439
 any object 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 then it is reflected from him in this way 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.430
 and formed the idea of ​​having 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.409
 or no obstacles during 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.409
 car parking 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.439
 Parktronics differ in quantity 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.109
 468 sensors and a type of informing a 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.909
 distance to obstacle indicator in 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.250
 model dependencies primary 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.259
 device warns when 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.929
 approaching an obstacle per meter 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.819
 one and a half meters with further approximation 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.640
 to obstruct the purity of the signals 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.740
 getting higher also the device output 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.950
 on a special display information about 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.950
 distance to the obstacle and its 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 location 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.570
 besides reversing for 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.940
 some poisoners exist 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.350
 tion with the need for bassists 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.850
 buying while moving it forward 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 relevant in the case of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.290
 obstructed and and parts 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.240
 the car 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.950
 for example in the case of high and long 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.470
 k-pop in this case need to know the points 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.160
 thieves front bumper of course 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.430
 parking sensors will not help in this case 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.860
 this and this in all the rest he 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.170
 will be a reliable assistant when parking 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.940
 take care of bumper install 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.940
 parking sensors in of the studio
