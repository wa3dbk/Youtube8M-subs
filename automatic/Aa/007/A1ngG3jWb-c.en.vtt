the hazard perception test is designed

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.330 
the hazard perception test is designed
to<00:00:07.180> test<00:00:07.419> your<00:00:07.600> response<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.740> developing

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
to test your response to developing

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.280 
to test your response to developing
hazards<00:00:09.820> that<00:00:10.240> you<00:00:10.360> may<00:00:10.540> encounter<00:00:10.720> while

when you feel you are encountering a
developing<00:00:33.100> hazard<00:00:33.520> this<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.510> something<00:00:34.930> that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
developing hazard this is something that

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.229 
developing hazard this is something that
would<00:00:35.199> cause<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.739> as<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.280> driver<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:37.059> take

for<00:00:57.760> responding<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.480> other<00:00:58.660> things<00:00:59.019> even

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
for responding to other things even

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.049 
for responding to other things even
though<00:00:59.829> they<00:00:59.980> may<00:01:00.160> not<00:01:00.370> develop<00:01:00.519> into<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
though they may not develop into a

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.079 
though they may not develop into a
hazard<00:01:01.649> however<00:01:02.649> don't<00:01:03.339> just<00:01:03.670> click<00:01:03.879> on

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
hazard however don't just click on

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.999 
hazard however don't just click on
everything<00:01:04.629> in<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.780> clip<00:01:05.080> or<00:01:05.470> click<00:01:05.799> in<00:01:05.950> a

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.280 
everything in the clip or click in a
pattern<00:01:06.250> because<00:01:07.000> if<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.329> do<00:01:07.570> you'll<00:01:08.049> see<00:01:08.140> a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
pattern because if you do you'll see a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.109 
pattern because if you do you'll see a
warning<00:01:08.590> message<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.460> won't<00:01:09.640> score<00:01:09.880> any

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
warning message and you won't score any

warning message and you won't score any
points<00:01:10.299> for<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.869> clip<00:01:11.759> let's<00:01:12.759> look<00:01:12.939> at<00:01:13.030> the

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
points for that clip let's look at the

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.330 
points for that clip let's look at the
clip<00:01:13.299> again<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.470> time<00:01:14.740> we<00:01:14.950> will<00:01:15.100> highlight

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
clip again this time we will highlight

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.039 
clip again this time we will highlight
the<00:01:15.670> things<00:01:15.939> you<00:01:16.240> should<00:01:16.509> have<00:01:16.630> been<00:01:16.750> aware<00:01:16.990> of

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
the things you should have been aware of

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.190 
the things you should have been aware of
whilst<00:01:17.560> watching<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.420> yellow<00:01:19.930> circle

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
whilst watching this yellow circle

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.160 
whilst watching this yellow circle
represents<00:01:21.100> potential<00:01:21.729> hazard<00:01:22.149> as<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.990> can

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
represents potential hazard as you can

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.319 
represents potential hazard as you can
see<00:01:23.439> this<00:01:23.920> does<00:01:24.130> not<00:01:24.340> cause<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.939> take<00:01:25.090> any

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
see this does not cause you to take any

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.990 
see this does not cause you to take any
form<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.869> action<00:01:26.320> therefore<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.700> not<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
form of action therefore it is not a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.240 
form of action therefore it is not a
developing<00:01:28.720> hazard<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:29.409> would<00:01:29.619> not<00:01:29.890> be

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
developing hazard and you would not be

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.590 
developing hazard and you would not be
scored<00:01:30.520> on<00:01:30.790> it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600

this red circle represents a developing
hazard<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:39.470> see<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.040> would<00:01:40.310> need

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
hazard you can see that you would need

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.820 
hazard you can see that you would need
to<00:01:40.790> take<00:01:40.939> action<00:01:41.450> here<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.440> would<00:01:42.650> be

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
to take action here and you would be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.719 
to take action here and you would be
scored<00:01:43.190> from<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:43.759> point<00:01:45.250> through<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.549> this
