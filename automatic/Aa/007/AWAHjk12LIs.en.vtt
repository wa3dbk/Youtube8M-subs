00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
can help people be more expressive and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.290 
can help people be more expressive and

this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.450> brand-new<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.140> us<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.730> see

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this is brand-new for us as you can see

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.750 
this is brand-new for us as you can see
the<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.750> dancer<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.620> move<00:02:25.830> quite<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> lot<00:02:26.400> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the the dancer they move quite a lot and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.120 
the the dancer they move quite a lot and
there<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.090> many<00:02:27.270> artifacts<00:02:27.990> from<00:02:28.650> muscle

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
there are many artifacts from muscle

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.820 
there are many artifacts from muscle
activity<00:02:29.430> from<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.210> believe<00:02:30.470> emotional<00:02:31.470> behave

then<00:02:32.070> we'll<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.400> all<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.880> data

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
then we'll just get all of this data

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
then we'll just get all of this data
huge<00:02:33.630> amount<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.260> data<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.710> then<00:02:35.130> we're<00:02:35.220> gonna

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
huge amount of data and then we're gonna

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.220 
huge amount of data and then we're gonna
look<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> data<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.330> we're<00:02:36.600> gonna<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:37.020> if

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
look at that data and we're gonna see if

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.760 
look at that data and we're gonna see if
we<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.560> pattern<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.090> see<00:02:39.240> pattern

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
we see pattern and if we see pattern

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.590 
we see pattern and if we see pattern
