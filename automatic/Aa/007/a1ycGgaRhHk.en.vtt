00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.900
 so first legend it's about 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.750
 roberto carlos brought him several 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.160
 once a lot of times entwined good you 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.340
 know it's the left-back 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.480
 brazilian today the 41 years old who is 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.020
 passed by the real 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.160
 good mainly he made 5 127 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.350
 matches to real so we know him 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 especially for that and also for his big 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.309
 strike from the left that's what 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.259
 characterizes 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.290
 roberto carlos it's a career 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.420
 professional from 1989 to 2012 so he 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.970
 has been restated for two years the terminal 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.470
 angie makhachkala before they pass 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.450
 also by the fenerbahce corinthians 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.280
 but that's his big part of his career 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.280
 he did at real madrid where he did 5 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.350
 127 games for 73 goals so his 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.909
 pro career it makes him a total of 770 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 match percent goals for back 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.360
 left we did not hurt in the know 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.060
 you there for his free kicks dexter of 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.210
 foot it's his big threat 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.360
 Brazilian international brief of course 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.020
 world champion and 125 selections for 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.510
 11 goals 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 So here is one of the left die 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.340
 football features it's a 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.600
 football legend and his big shot 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.720
 its top speed 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.040
 that's why we recognize and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.950
 we know roberto carlos 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.930
 so here is in any case sure 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.640
 15 he will have a beautiful card a beautiful card 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 I had seen him groan anyway 1 84th 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.759
 1.94 to 84 draws a very large card 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.049
 is now speeds worth maybe 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.220
 more generous but hey it's not too much 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.570
 the stages that interests us because 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.869
 I do not know more than that 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.599
 it's just that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.980
 So here the chance for first player 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.019
 the second player is a Portuguese 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.819
 it is organic and daring and we therefore 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.750
 who died this year he died 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.790
 the 5th of January 2014 he was 71 years old 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.780
 he is a player older than me 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.030
 not known or approached in 90 denies him 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 that sense he's he played from 57 to 78 we 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.260
 here is a mythical attacker 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.849
 benfica he made 440 match for the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.099
 benfica and scored four hundred and sixty 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.129
 thirteen goals 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.790
 so here he is nicknamed the panther 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.269
 black 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.940
 we know it and serve the greatest 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.980
 players take am gay and saw that he is 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.440
 death that's it we talked a lot 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.010
 of him so maybe who will be in the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.750
 legends from 6 to 15 his brushed course 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.629
 567 match for 591 goals and selection 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.709
 Portuguese 64 64 caps for 41 goals 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.090
 which you and bio is a lure 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.250
 monstrous here I think there is little he can 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.410
 to be on fifa 15 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.280
 as usual the stats a good ccq of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.790
 approximation 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.470
 so here is roberto carlos eusebio and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.940
 to finish maradona maradona bath 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.230
 mythical toy meetic is the legend 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.090
 Argentine the greatest player of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.230
 the history of argentina is long 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.370
 but who will not go back but if 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.420
 maradona but I think it takes 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.270
 respect elders still 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.470
 maradona this was number one but 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.410
 if it was the successor of maradona 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 but it's true that it's a legend 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.510
 sene people so his career is 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.060
 2.76 to 97 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.270
 he played napoli mainly 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.790
 barcelona seville he made 589 matches 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.030
 for 3,139 goals from the anthology goals 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.250
 need to present them we have separated from 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.660
 maradona you know very well in 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.690
 argentine team wallace was the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.720
 leader 1 91 caps 34 goals in the corner 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.000
 attacking midway anyway where he is 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.740
 known for his hand of god 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.330
 short here is maradona sign legend in 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.230
 Argentina 's abundant if it's one of 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.820
 greatest players in the history of 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.140
 football so and chances that they 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.850
 be sure that everyone, if not 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.419
 copyright or other bullshit I 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.960
 I'm not aware but here is maradona 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.640
 here are some of the greatest players 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.090
 So the story a big big map 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.080
 cards 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.090
 this 14th technique so I think that the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.500
 very beautiful card 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.210
 so here are three legends for this 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.380
 episode 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.419
 roberto carlos and you and bio and 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.430
 maradona so there under agreement with me 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 what to tell me about a comment no 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.180

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.050

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.610
 by clicking on I like 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.010
 up kicks and ended it takes two 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.390
 seconds and we go that's it 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.550
 we are going to stop on speaking French 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.690

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.690
