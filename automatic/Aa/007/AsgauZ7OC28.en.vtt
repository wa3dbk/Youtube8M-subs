00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 I hope you like it and let's start the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 what we will use is a balloon 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.340
 paper squares 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.750
 they have to be many paper squares 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.750
 the plastic cups 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.800
 a coal 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.800
 of white and black pear 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:09.980
 big brush 15 small 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.790
 and finally a pencil now yes we start 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.230
 in a small glass with water 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.230
 we will put the mattress 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.710
 and we revolve it well well fine now 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.710
 we inflate the globe 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.640
 of the size that is a little bit more 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.640
 big that we head 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.329
 we proceed to the paper and we will join it with 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.329
 our previous mix 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 we will fill half of the globe only the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.350
 half 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.680
 we will need for this four 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.600
 layers of paper 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.600
 so that it is very hard and resistant 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.700
 in this way 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.680
 now here I went ahead a little here 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:44.080
 I already have it done and the only thing we have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 what to do are the retouching 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.689
 what are the eyes in the end 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.480
 in a recipient glass the black teapot and 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.450
 the white tempera more white than black 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 we mix it well and we have this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.810
 way 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.390
 i 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.780
 finishing this tutorial I'm going to 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.280
 show how it was beautiful the most 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.970
 face 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.239
 they like to give you some tweaks that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.310
 are the marks and eyes good in the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.280
 part of the eyes I did not want to do the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.919
 hollow because he was not lost 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.070
 like magic the mask if they want 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.930
 make gas holes in them and 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.120
 I recommend that in the back 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.700
 put a black mesh for you 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.980
 can see and on the outside they look black and 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.470
