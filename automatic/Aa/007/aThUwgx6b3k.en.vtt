00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.169
 I do not believe that Seville is very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.790
 superior or in the cordoba I have a lot 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.020
 what to improve 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.110
 we have done a style of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.400
 party and they have done another and we have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.400
 won and that's it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.830
 good 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.480
 It is clear that it is a team that if you 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.970
 puts ahead of the marker 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.030
 It is very difficult because he defends very well 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.590
 they get in with the four-handed line 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.140
 two midfielders are a very team 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.720
 physical leaves in very few spaces good 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.300
 we have done what we wanted 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 do we played pretty well 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.030
 football we see that now we have not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.270
 entered pretty well by bands 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.830
 good first division the little ones 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 mistakes are paid very expensive 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 and nothing else if that's what you have to learn 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.680
 you have to keep looking looking towards 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.540
 up as I have always done continue 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 working on the same line and there's 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.660
 plus 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.840
 although he makes more mistakes normally 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.240
 loses but I think we have done 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.409
 many good things and I believe that the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.609
 team is very good line then 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.280
 it is also true that we have played this 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.679
 start of season with teams with 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 teams that are going to be up and I think 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.470
 that we have faced in all 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.670
 matches each one may have won 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.620
 yes it is true that today it has been played 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.019
 well I think that also 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.379
 but good is the mistake of the first goal 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.930
 then on the second goal player enter 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.800
 just for good is what there is a theme 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 of time to learn in this period 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.380
 and keep improving and go getting 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.120
 three points with winning some game already 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.880
 from then on to keep growing this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.990
 is very long just started by both 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 I do not think anyone has to 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.300
 discourage me I think you could be 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 angry if the team had given very 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.480
 bad image I think for nothing 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.030
 image I believe on the contrary that they give us 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.140
 good image and to continue because this 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.740
 it is very long the objective will be achieved 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.740
 safe 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 I do not know and of course no no no no 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.260
 worried about anything talk 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.360
 I'm not interested either, my players are 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.060
 the best for me I do not care what gives me 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.310
 same each one is different the each 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 party gives everything he has 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.310
 I think it's too early to start 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.660
 whistle the players I think we already had 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.780
 the experience last year did not work 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.780
 nothing
