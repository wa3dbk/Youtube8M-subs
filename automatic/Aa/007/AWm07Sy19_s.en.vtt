00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.640
 in general, the day passed 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:04.449
 the ground lay still will forget 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:08.640

 2 we wagon means putty 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.000
 fiberglass she is tougher with her 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.580
 roughly speaking the form is set but there is 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 Of course there is putty criterion there 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.850
 should be thicker there is a certain 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.800
 The moment we have through and zdarova boys 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.130
 so we have shorter cases 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.430
 the first layer put putty from 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 fiberglass 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.070
 with fiberglass and protect us here 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.770
 need to be done today ideally 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 at least in two hours 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.020

 pour it is called forget the ground chipped 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.080
 drop shopton shorter for we lima 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.970
 surface respectively for Moto Valim 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 now wait to dry and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.540
 low fat 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.890
 here then we will gloss over 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:32.850
 putty oh well hardener 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.850

00:02:46.370 --> 00:03:00.200
 prevents you from expelling air 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.200
 assembly itself then enter 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.650
 that this is the first layer in my life therefore 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.200
 secondly, this is the first layer that we 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.780
 scored 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.879
 with the main protruding moments seams and so 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:29.409

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:57.230
 lacquer well, it is clear who will be crooked it 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.220
 us first layer here is a transition plan 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.510
 relatively smoothly that's all taken 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.510
 universal putty and 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:12.420
 how so that's why we continue tomorrow 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 surely yesterday we finished on this 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.120
 left it accordingly for the night yet 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.440

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.600
 It will fit to test us so far 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.600
 let's prepare the car for further work 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:08.610
 in short this is the first layer 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.770
 universal putty impose 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.090
 specifically on problem areas that have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:19.379
 we have emerged after we cleaned 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:24.210
 surface up to here and made a shape 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:26.639
 Wing more or less, respectively 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.479
 wait until dry and succeed 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.830
 today that 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.750
 shook today and probably hardly already 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.740
 The third layer will turn out to make but at least 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.470

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:51.840
 responsible before ass back -ass 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.800
 overnight will dry start tomorrow and this 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.800
 will be the third day 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.660
