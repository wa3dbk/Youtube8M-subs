in<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.760> battle<00:00:54.140> anyway<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> egos<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in this battle anyway I egos to the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
in this battle anyway I egos to the
focus<00:00:56.340> blast<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> full

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
focus blast when I can take that full

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.319 
focus blast when I can take that full
like<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> boss<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> set<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> spikes<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like a boss I go to set up the spikes I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.369 
like a boss I go to set up the spikes I
have<00:01:00.510> seen<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> Venus<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.530> his<00:01:01.649> team<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.239> I

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
have seen the Venus or on his team and I

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.050 
have seen the Venus or on his team and I
think<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.710> switch<00:01:05.460> him<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> can

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
think that could switch him in so I can

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520 
think that could switch him in so I can
get<00:01:06.210> rid<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.080> walks

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
get rid of that thing because it walks

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.590 
get rid of that thing because it walks
crafty<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:09.060> well<00:01:09.530> anyway<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.680> switch<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.820> my

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
crafty very well anyway I switch into my

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
crafty very well anyway I switch into my
shams<00:01:13.020> low<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.979> predict<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> focus

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
shams low here to predict the focus

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.249 
shams low here to predict the focus
blast<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.210> try<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.689> energy<00:01:15.780> ball<00:01:16.080> off

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
blast and try and get an energy ball off

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.640 
blast and try and get an energy ball off
to<00:01:16.290> Kip<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.509> doesn't<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.659> too<00:01:18.720> well<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> predict

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
to Kip it doesn't go too well I predict

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.140 
to Kip it doesn't go too well I predict
the<00:01:19.770> focus<00:01:20.100> blast<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.700> goes<00:01:20.820> straight<00:01:20.970> through

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the focus blast it goes straight through

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.710 
the focus blast it goes straight through
but<00:01:22.020> energy<00:01:22.350> ball<00:01:22.500> doesn't<00:01:23.220> quite<00:01:24.119> kill<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but energy ball doesn't quite kill it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.050 
but energy ball doesn't quite kill it
just<00:01:24.990> take<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.619> read<00:01:25.830> healthier<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
just take the down to read healthier and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.289 
just take the down to read healthier and
then<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.950> Blastoise<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> big<00:01:29.729> cheese<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
then a Blastoise or the big cheese is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.560 
then a Blastoise or the big cheese is
ready<00:01:31.020> too<00:01:31.350> high<00:01:31.439> drop<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.369> oblivion

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
ready too high drop on me into oblivion

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.640 
ready too high drop on me into oblivion
so<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.290> Yankee<00:01:34.770> animal<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:36.650> do

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
so there are Yankee animal is down do

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
so there are Yankee animal is down do
believe<00:01:37.920> i<00:01:38.130> switch<00:01:38.400> into<00:01:38.759> mice<00:01:38.970> crafty<00:01:39.750> now

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
believe i switch into mice crafty now

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
believe i switch into mice crafty now
just<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.280> Moxie<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:41.790> he

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just to see if i get the Moxie but he

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990 
just to see if i get the Moxie but he
then<00:01:42.659> switches<00:01:43.110> into<00:01:43.350> his<00:01:43.590> Venus<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.640> 40

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
then switches into his Venus or as I 40

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
then switches into his Venus or as I 40
would

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
would

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.860 
would
I<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:47.250> give<00:01:47.430> her<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.550> drain<00:01:47.940> punch<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.570> as

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
I did give her the drain punch but as

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.500 
I did give her the drain punch but as
you<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> Venus<00:01:50.190> or<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.550> does<00:01:51.050> overall

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
you can see the Venus or it does overall

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.090 
you can see the Venus or it does overall
so<00:01:54.510> despite<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> spikes<00:01:55.410> got<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so despite the spikes got now it's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.780 
so despite the spikes got now it's
really<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.910> wanted<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.300> well<00:01:58.610> yeah<00:01:59.610> he's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
definitely geval mega Venus was also my

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.800 
definitely geval mega Venus was also my
thick<00:02:03.030> fat<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:04.110> predict<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.300> grass<00:02:06.300> move<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
he's got a sash it's got three much just

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.280 
he's got a sash it's got three much just
going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> keep<00:03:35.580> reusing<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:36.269> sash<00:03:36.510> so

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
going to keep reusing that sash so

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.500 
going to keep reusing that sash so
during<00:03:37.530> punch<00:03:37.739> does<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> decent<00:03:38.730> amount<00:03:39.150> I

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
during punch does a decent amount I

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.110 
during punch does a decent amount I
guess<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:40.650> go<00:03:40.830> for<00:03:40.950> another<00:03:41.040> one<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.610> turns

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
guess do go for another one but turns

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.900 
guess do go for another one but turns
out<00:03:42.269> add<00:03:42.540> synthesis<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.040> I'm<00:03:44.160> guessing<00:03:44.370> that's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
out add synthesis so I'm guessing that's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.640 
out add synthesis so I'm guessing that's
why<00:03:45.209> don't<00:03:45.420> boys<00:03:45.750> movies

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
why don't boys movies

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.729
