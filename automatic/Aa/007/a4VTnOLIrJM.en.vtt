than in my day and I think that that's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
than in my day and I think that that's
where<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.740> having<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.099> hard<00:01:23.250> time<00:01:23.310> as

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
where we're having a hard time as

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.570 
where we're having a hard time as
parents<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.330> relate<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.399> these

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
parents to relate they have all these

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
parents to relate they have all these
technologies<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.869> didn't<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.170> right

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
technologies that we didn't have right

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
technologies that we didn't have right

be at school the kid would come home and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and I think that's where the difference

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.820 
and I think that's where the difference
lies<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.360> every<00:01:57.810> week<00:01:58.470> there's<00:01:58.739> a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
lies and there's every week there's a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.040 
lies and there's every week there's a
new<00:01:58.950> program<00:01:59.550> out<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.479> even<00:02:00.720> know

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
new program out that I don't even know

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.260 
new program out that I don't even know
I'm<00:02:01.319> trying<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> keep<00:02:02.069> up<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.239> know

mentioned siblings who are bullying each
other<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.300> myself<00:02:09.360> well<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
other and I think to myself well is that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.680 
other and I think to myself well is that
just<00:02:10.679> siblings<00:02:11.099> being<00:02:11.310> siblings<00:02:11.879> or<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just siblings being siblings or how as a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.760 
just siblings being siblings or how as a
parent<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.290> know<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.620> they've

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
parent would you know that they've

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
parent would you know that they've
crossed<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.190> line<00:02:14.370> into<00:02:14.580> bullying<00:02:15.030> well<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
crossed the line into bullying well I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
crossed the line into bullying well I
think<00:02:15.600> first<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> think<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.650> parent

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
think first of all I think a parent

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.200 
think first of all I think a parent
knows<00:02:17.130> their<00:02:17.370> child

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
knows their child

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.950 
knows their child
and<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.320> see<00:02:19.710> everything<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.940> feel<00:02:21.390> with

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
and so you see everything I feel with

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.340 
and so you see everything I feel with
the<00:02:22.080> body<00:02:22.230> language<00:02:22.470> whether<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.460> just<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the body language whether it's just a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.170 
the body language whether it's just a
person<00:02:25.350> at<00:02:25.470> school<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.130> own<00:02:26.250> child<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
person at school or your own child so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.940 
person at school or your own child so
one<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.600> things<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.990> advise<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.680> for

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
one of the things that I advise is for

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
one of the things that I advise is for
parents<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.640> actually<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.630> one-on-one<00:02:31.110> time

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
parents to actually have one-on-one time

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
parents to actually have one-on-one time
with<00:02:31.410> their<00:02:31.770> children<00:02:31.800> especially<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.820> ones

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
with their children especially the ones

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330 
with their children especially the ones
that<00:02:33.390> are<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.960> situation<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:35.190> when

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that are in that situation because when

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860 
that are in that situation because when
your<00:02:35.490> one-on-one<00:02:35.760> they<00:02:36.210> will<00:02:36.360> talk<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> little

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
your one-on-one they will talk a little

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.680 
your one-on-one they will talk a little
bit<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:39.150> talk

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
bit more with you and to actually talk

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.360 
bit more with you and to actually talk
with<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> other<00:02:40.170> sibling<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:40.950> saying<00:02:41.220> listen

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
with the other sibling and saying listen

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.910 
with the other sibling and saying listen
this<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.090> teasing<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.350> teasing

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
this is teasing and this is not teasing

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.380 
this is teasing and this is not teasing
right<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.490> think<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.880> make<00:02:45.060> big

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
right and I think we make big

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.330 
right and I think we make big
distinction<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.010> you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
distinction with that because if you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.880 
distinction with that because if you
tease<00:02:47.580> too<00:02:47.880> often<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.960> sibling<00:02:49.350> actually<00:02:49.740> my

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
tease too often your sibling actually my

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
tease too often your sibling actually my
belief<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.030> yet<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.540> want

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
belief it right and yet you don't want

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
belief it right and yet you don't want
you've<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> graphic<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.310> an<00:02:53.550> open

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
sibling was doing it because I always

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.290 
sibling was doing it because I always
feel<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.200> when<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> sibling<00:03:07.920> does<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.370> he<00:03:09.090> or

feel that when a sibling does it he or

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.870 
feel that when a sibling does it he or
she<00:03:09.510> also<00:03:09.840> has<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> reason<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.730> is
