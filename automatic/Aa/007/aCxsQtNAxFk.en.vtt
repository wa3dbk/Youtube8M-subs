00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
process where the beef is stir-fried

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.699 
process where the beef is stir-fried
first<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:29.330> taken<00:02:29.690> out<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.019> then<00:02:30.290> the

other ingredients of spices are added to
the<00:02:33.530> wok<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.069> I'm<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> begin<00:02:35.600> first<00:02:36.110> by

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the wok and I'm going to begin first by

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.979

heating up the wok before adding the oil

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.380 
heating up the wok before adding the oil
so<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.950> oil<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.430> coat<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.849> surface<00:02:41.030> of
