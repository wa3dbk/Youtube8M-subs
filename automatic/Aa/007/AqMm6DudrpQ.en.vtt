00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:21.820
 take positive but there were some 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:32.259
 very nice about it and looking forward 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:33.670
 but I was modest once 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.020
 I have seen and still afterwards 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.340
 There he was informed is formally can 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 was so little offside and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.740
 of course, his artificially put on 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.020
 but maybe next time 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.160
 There is a bit more but me 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.620
 I was not sure about the Crimea 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:05.220
 is and then rehearsing the heart 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 the putschists assigned effortless so 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.120
 I want to be yes 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.360
 Satisfied for me and with it you too 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 today satisfied with the disgust tactics 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.880
 and then you have an explanation for it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.610
 that the form was not there is now 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.500
 So how much can now nobody thought there 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.860
 there are such phases but so he then 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.160
 exactly the case was and then over 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:02:04.030
 not for a long time and he will be back 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:02:09.530
 uphill and you give everything and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.630
 special and the pays lies where you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.450
 I know if I can improve that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.299
 better again but my best too 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.360
 give and hop klop that is better 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:27.310
 is in causes I can all a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.250
 headache that someone disagree when 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.769
 It is said that it is in the head again and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.330
 is the football but that many 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:42.830
 comfort goes off and much is decided 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:47.140
 but do you have some players 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.420
 supported and sometimes asked how 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.970
 they supported her but she is one 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.890
 another conversation led 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.209
 especially the older ones and yes had 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.080
 has given support and trust 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.900
 that helped to speak like that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.100
 Gaped when you realize that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.090
 Teammates stand behind you and 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.860
 support 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.840
 then that is very helpful 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.350
 with a person horst heldt on saturday 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.579
 The people also forget that it is 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.120
 still a young player is the 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.460
 makes mistakes 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.300
 Do you see that too is surprised 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.950
 that you have some more than 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.180
 This will be considered as the player arrives 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 no longer tell you this one word 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.590
 I already have a few games but 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.209
 with the age now so makes mistakes 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 but I think everyone older people 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.050
 glass should be less and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.630
 should be more consistent in a game 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.060
 but try to improve it 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.140
 to maintain or win the constancy 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.580
 and expect that mistakes everyone makes and 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.959
 if I am one or the other piece is 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.959
 that does not mean that bad 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.390
 we wanted 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.330
 keep it together only together 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.350
 so it did not go on and then 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.000
 in the end also need a bit of luck 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.660
 the water on and success experiences 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.300
 because that would be at the end yet to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.490
 get back to a sensible one 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:17.220
 can give everything but at least it does 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:19.350
 the ribbon-luck missing or 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
 His dedication to trust and success 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 if we play the game then again 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.760
 Bit together and everything too 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.980
 give 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.940
 we hope that it continues, but we 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.630
 working so that it continues 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.270
 you can never be there but of course 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.150
 Now everything is a bit more positive 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.320
 We want that and we want that mood 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.790
 then go to the next games 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.240
 and then there confidently and also 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 occur better 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.040
 we try to hold you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.710
 yes my primary task and one demands 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.950
 can be ordered in another the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.950
 very beautiful 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.810
 do you want to take son son 13 0 and 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:07.389
 say okay then if that's true 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.650
 its gonna take it but i play 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.870
 also like against galatasaray 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:18.099
 and want at your home in the square 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.300
 but if it works differently then it is 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:24.960
 Also important there was no problem 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.960
 is an issue in the cabin 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.729
 now first on saturday in the 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.599
 bundesliga and the other will be up 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.599
 pushed into the background
