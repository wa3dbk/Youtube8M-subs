studs you want to make sure that you

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.169 
studs you want to make sure that you
drill<00:00:10.410> your<00:00:10.440> rail<00:00:10.710> into<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> studs<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.730> order

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
drill your rail into the studs in order

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
drill your rail into the studs in order
to<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.510> maximum<00:00:12.960> weight<00:00:13.170> capacity<00:00:13.340> which

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
to get the maximum weight capacity which

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.339 
to get the maximum weight capacity which
is<00:00:14.519> seventeen<00:00:15.000> hundred<00:00:15.300> and<00:00:15.450> fifty<00:00:15.960> pounds

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
is seventeen hundred and fifty pounds

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.380 
is seventeen hundred and fifty pounds
this<00:00:16.860> can<00:00:17.099> hold<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.759> stuff<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this can hold all of that stuff that you

this can hold all of that stuff that you
have<00:00:18.540> there<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:19.680> once<00:00:19.919> you<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.250> you'll

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
have there then once you do that you'll

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.639 
have there then once you do that you'll
simply<00:00:21.060> drill<00:00:21.540> in<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> screws<00:00:22.110> into<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:22.649 
simply drill in the screws into the

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.530 
simply drill in the screws into the
pre-drilled<00:00:23.220> holes<00:00:23.640> making<00:00:24.090> sure<00:00:24.270> that<00:00:24.419> you

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
pre-drilled holes making sure that you

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.450 
pre-drilled holes making sure that you
drill<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:24.899> into<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> studs<00:00:25.500> making<00:00:26.279> sure

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
drill them into the studs making sure

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.639 
drill them into the studs making sure
that<00:00:26.610> your<00:00:26.759> rail<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> level<00:00:27.470> sounds<00:00:28.470> pretty

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
that your rail is level sounds pretty

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.979 
that your rail is level sounds pretty
simple<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.369> simple<00:00:29.790> so<00:00:30.450> once<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.840> have

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
simple it's very simple so once we have

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.530 
simple it's very simple so once we have
the<00:00:31.140> steel<00:00:31.470> rail<00:00:31.770> onto<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> wall<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.360> we'll

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the steel rail onto the wall then we'll

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.810 
the steel rail onto the wall then we'll
take<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.929> rail<00:00:34.079> cover<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.710> simply<00:00:35.309> slide<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
take the rail cover and simply slide it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.290 
take the rail cover and simply slide it
over<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.440> snap<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.710> place<00:00:40.879> once<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> have

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
over and snap it into place once we have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
over and snap it into place once we have
the<00:00:42.480> rail<00:00:42.629> cover<00:00:42.960> secure<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.949> steel<00:00:44.219> rail

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the rail cover secure on the steel rail

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
the rail cover secure on the steel rail
then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.210> choose<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> variety<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
then you choose from the variety of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.169 
then you choose from the variety of
hooks<00:00:46.679> that<00:00:46.769> we<00:00:46.949> have<00:00:47.129> depending<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.059> your

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
hooks that we have depending on your

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.829 
hooks that we have depending on your
needs<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.949> stick<00:00:49.949> them<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.280> wall

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
needs and just stick them to the wall

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.049 
needs and just stick them to the wall
this<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.050> utility<00:00:52.410> hook<00:00:52.859> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> ladder

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this is a utility hook this is a ladder

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
this is a utility hook this is a ladder
hook<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.870> simply<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.499> snap<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.100> into

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
hook you simply just snap them into

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
hook you simply just snap them into
place<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.140> then<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.350> ready<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> start

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
show us some of the new items that were

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.230 
show us some of the new items that were
introducing<00:01:37.130> well<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.399> we<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.969> cord

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
introducing well first we have the cord

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.350 
introducing well first we have the cord
manager<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.530> has<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> same<00:01:41.360> latching

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
manager which has the same latching

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.230 
manager which has the same latching
capabilities<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.590> other<00:01:43.740> hooks<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
capabilities as the other hooks but this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.660 
capabilities as the other hooks but this
is<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.049> innovative<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> allows<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
is very innovative because it allows you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
is very innovative because it allows you
to<00:01:47.759> actually<00:01:47.939> wind<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.689> cord<00:01:49.079> while<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to actually wind a cord while it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.700 
to actually wind a cord while it's
installed<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.030> rail<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.630> also<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
installed on your rail we also have the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
installed on your rail we also have the
cooler<00:01:52.979> hook<00:01:53.340> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> our<00:01:54.600> new<00:01:54.840> mini

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
