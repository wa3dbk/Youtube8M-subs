00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
mac prolongwear concealer and use that

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.370 
mac prolongwear concealer and use that
as<00:01:49.670> my<00:01:49.850> eyeshadow<00:01:50.420> primer<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> basically

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
as my eyeshadow primer so I basically

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.910 
as my eyeshadow primer so I basically
just<00:01:51.680> went<00:01:52.040> over<00:01:52.370> my<00:01:52.400> eyelids<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.680> put<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.800> on

just went over my eyelids and put it on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950 
just went over my eyelids and put it on
there<00:01:55.159> just<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.030> mattify<00:01:56.659> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
there just so that it can mattify and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.050 
there just so that it can mattify and
also<00:01:57.680> cover<00:01:57.950> up<00:01:58.159> any<00:01:58.370> redness<00:01:58.670> or

a<00:02:08.810> little<00:02:08.929> bit<00:02:09.140> darker<00:02:10.000> unfortunately<00:02:11.000> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
a little bit darker unfortunately I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.770 
a little bit darker unfortunately I
would<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.750> little<00:02:12.110> bit<00:02:12.260> too<00:02:12.470> long<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:14.330> move

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
would a little bit too long to like move

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.240 
would a little bit too long to like move
it<00:02:14.900> around<00:02:15.049> so<00:02:15.409> it<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.769> little<00:02:16.099> bit

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it around so it was a little bit

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.699 
it around so it was a little bit
difficult<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> basically<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.659> took<00:02:18.260> this

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
difficult but I basically just took this

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.780 
difficult but I basically just took this
concealer<00:02:19.670> brush<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.060> kind<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.420> moved

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
around and blended it out and I ended up

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.399 
around and blended it out and I ended up
taking<00:02:23.879> my<00:02:24.180> fingers<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.840> doing<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.200> same

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.140 
that between that first medium brown and
the<00:03:46.470> black<00:03:46.709> color<00:03:46.949> we<00:03:47.099> put<00:03:47.280> down<00:03:47.519> kind<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:47.970> as

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the black color we put down kind of as

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.509 
the black color we put down kind of as
our<00:03:48.359> transition<00:03:49.049> into<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.739> transition<00:03:50.370> color

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
our transition into the transition color

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.280 
our transition into the transition color
I<00:03:50.849> don't<00:03:51.449> know<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:51.659> just<00:03:51.690> kind<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
I don't know it's just kind of like the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.680 
I don't know it's just kind of like the
middle<00:03:52.590> shade<00:03:52.859> because<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.489> smoky<00:03:54.120> eye<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.239> just

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
middle shade because a smoky eye is just

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.149 
middle shade because a smoky eye is just
all<00:03:54.810> about<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:56.040> eye<00:03:56.220> being<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.849> nice<00:03:57.329> gradient

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
all about the eye being a nice gradient

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.469 
all about the eye being a nice gradient
so<00:03:59.159> I'm<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.459> going<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.609> keep<00:03:59.819> blending<00:04:00.359> that

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
so I'm just going to keep blending that

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.149 
so I'm just going to keep blending that
back<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.989> forth<00:04:01.079> into<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> crease<00:04:01.979> from

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
back and forth into the crease from

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.909 
back and forth into the crease from
inner<00:04:02.549> corner<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.970> outer<00:04:03.299> corner<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.500> smoky

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
inner corner to outer corner and a smoky

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.860 
inner corner to outer corner and a smoky
eye<00:04:04.949> is<00:04:05.159> all<00:04:05.489> about<00:04:05.819> going<00:04:06.060> back<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:06.689> just

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
eye is all about going back and just

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.080 
eye is all about going back and just
looking<00:04:07.139> at<00:04:07.319> what<00:04:07.829> needs<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.340> be<00:04:08.430> blended<00:04:08.669> more

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
looking at what needs to be blended more

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.300 
looking at what needs to be blended more
so<00:04:09.359> I'm<00:04:09.449> taking<00:04:09.629> my<00:04:09.840> e35<00:04:10.470> brush<00:04:10.739> again<00:04:11.159> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so I'm taking my e35 brush again and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.309 
so I'm taking my e35 brush again and
just<00:04:11.400> blending<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.479> that<00:04:12.900> crease<00:04:13.169> a<00:04:13.199> little

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
just blending that that crease a little

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.110 
just blending that that crease a little
more<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.919> then<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.430> back<00:04:14.579> with<00:04:14.790> some<00:04:14.970> more

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
more and then going back with some more

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.999 
more and then going back with some more
Brown<00:04:15.389> because<00:04:15.689> I<00:04:15.780> felt<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.349> needed<00:04:16.380> some

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
Brown because I felt like it needed some

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.839 
Brown because I felt like it needed some

and I'm going back and just blending eat
with<00:04:21.180> each<00:04:21.389> step<00:04:21.690> because<00:04:22.049> that's<00:04:22.289> what<00:04:22.470> a

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
with each step because that's what a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.200 
with each step because that's what a
smoky<00:04:22.919> eye<00:04:22.949> is<00:04:23.070> all<00:04:23.310> about<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.849> all<00:04:24.030> about

come together because you're kind of

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.390 
come together because you're kind of

the<00:05:33.520> bottom<00:05:33.819> lash<00:05:34.000> line<00:05:34.029> so<00:05:34.389> it<00:05:34.599> doesn't<00:05:34.900> look

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
the bottom lash line so it doesn't look

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.350 
the bottom lash line so it doesn't look
unbalanced<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.949> take<00:05:36.819> your<00:05:36.969> time<00:05:37.180> with
