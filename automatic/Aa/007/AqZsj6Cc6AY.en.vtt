and now these are some really special
lights<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.920> dot<00:00:14.219> series<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
lights it's the dot series now with the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.480 
lights it's the dot series now with the
dot<00:00:15.690> series<00:00:16.139> you'll<00:00:16.590> notice<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> LEDs

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
dot series you'll notice the LEDs

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.429 
dot series you'll notice the LEDs
actually<00:00:17.910> looked<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.119> lot<00:00:18.270> different<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.990> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
actually looked a lot different and this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.990 
actually looked a lot different and this
is<00:00:19.619> using<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.980> new<00:00:20.130> technology<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
is using a new technology which is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.990 
is using a new technology which is
called<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.630> chip<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.199> board<00:00:22.260> or<00:00:22.800> cob<00:00:23.519> whatever

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
called a chip on board or cob whatever

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.120 
called a chip on board or cob whatever
you<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.330> well<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> new<00:00:25.560> LED

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you like well with this new LED

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
you like well with this new LED
technology<00:00:26.340> you'll<00:00:26.970> notice<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.449> color

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
technology you'll notice with color

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
technology you'll notice with color
mixing<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.949> you're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.250> through<00:00:29.369> your

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
mixing when you're going through your

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.339 
mixing when you're going through your
DMX<00:00:30.000> colors<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.630> anything<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.140> even

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
DMX colors or anything like that or even

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
DMX colors or anything like that or even
the<00:00:31.560> built-in<00:00:31.890> programs<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.239> real

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the built-in programs you get some real

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
the built-in programs you get some real
smooth<00:00:33.930> color<00:00:34.230> mixing<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> series

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
smooth color mixing and with this series

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
smooth color mixing and with this series
just<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.140> anything<00:00:37.469> you've<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just like with anything you've got to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
just like with anything you've got to
have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> few<00:00:38.879> different<00:00:39.000> functions<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.079> few

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
have a few different functions and a few

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.830 
have a few different functions and a few
different<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.059> features<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.660> with

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
different kind of features on it so with

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450 
different kind of features on it so with
this<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.620> you're<00:00:43.770> seeing<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> dots

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this what you're seeing is the dots

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.450 
this what you're seeing is the dots
panel<00:00:44.910> 2.4<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.500> comes<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.010> barn

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
panel 2.4 it actually comes with barn

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
panel 2.4 it actually comes with barn
doors<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> wanted<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> widen<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
doors so if you wanted to widen or you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
doors so if you wanted to widen or you
know<00:00:50.219> narrow<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> beam<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
know narrow down the beam on this you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.510 
know narrow down the beam on this you
could<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> great<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.280> you're

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
could do so which is great if you're

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.400 
could do so which is great if you're
doing<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.000> lighting<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> theatrical

lighting<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.550> could<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
lighting because you could use this to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.510 
lighting because you could use this to
set<00:00:57.809> any<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.379> color<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> want<00:00:58.980> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
area you can just easily use the barn

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
area you can just easily use the barn
doors<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:03.930> included<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:04.920> again<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
doors that are included now again it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130 
doors that are included now again it
does<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.760> full<00:01:05.970> DMX<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
does have full DMX so you can use this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
does have full DMX so you can use this
with<00:01:07.320> any<00:01:07.619> DMX<00:01:08.220> controller<00:01:08.750> even<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
with any DMX controller even if you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.990 
with any DMX controller even if you
wanted<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> link<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.619> together<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
wanted to link these together and you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310 
wanted to link these together and you
could<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.720> know<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> whole

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
could just do you know just a whole

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.410 
could just do you know just a whole
series<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> dots<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.240> doing

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
series of the dots and have them doing

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.530 
series of the dots and have them doing
all<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> color<00:01:15.990> chases<00:01:16.500> together<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> once

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
all the color chases together so once

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.260 
all the color chases together so once
again<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.110> dots<00:01:19.409> panel<00:01:19.799> 2.4<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:21.090> also

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
again this is the dots panel 2.4 we also

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
again this is the dots panel 2.4 we also
have<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> dots<00:01:21.869> flood<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> larger<00:01:23.310> than

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
have a dots flood which is larger than

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.090 
have a dots flood which is larger than
this<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> barn<00:01:24.509> doors<00:01:24.750> also<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:26.009> our

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this with the barn doors also and in our

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
this with the barn doors also and in our
program<00:01:26.520> show<00:01:26.759> here<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> dots<00:01:27.509> matrix

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
program show here we have a dots matrix

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
program show here we have a dots matrix
which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:28.890> favorites<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> four

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
which is one of my favorites it's a four

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
which is one of my favorites it's a four
by<00:01:30.000> four<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> doesn't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
by four just like this but it doesn't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
by four just like this but it doesn't
have<00:01:32.009> barn<00:01:32.400> doors<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.299> one's<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have barn doors if that one's actually

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
have barn doors if that one's actually

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
great just like its name to do matrix

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.770 
great just like its name to do matrix
because<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.240> nice<00:01:36.479> things

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

because one of the really nice things
about<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.189> individual

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
about these you can have individual

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
about these you can have individual
control<00:01:39.180> over<00:01:39.479> each<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.159> red<00:01:41.159> green

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
control over each one of the red green

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
control over each one of the red green
and<00:01:41.520> blue<00:01:41.700> LEDs<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.540> each<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.470> these

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and blue LEDs and each one of these

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
and blue LEDs and each one of these
little<00:01:43.799> diodes<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.000> wanted<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> do

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
little diodes so if you wanted to do

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
little diodes so if you wanted to do
matrix<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> effects<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> chases<00:01:47.070> on

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
matrix kind of effects and chases on

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
matrix kind of effects and chases on
your<00:01:47.399> own<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.149> could<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.170> yeah<00:01:49.290> that's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
your own you could do so so yeah that's
