00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
stuff off anubias you see that one going

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
stuff off anubias you see that one going
off<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> Nubians<00:01:41.670> anubius<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> way<00:01:42.450> gets

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
off the Nubians anubius by the way gets

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
off the Nubians anubius by the way gets
a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> algae<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.220> slower

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
a lot of algae because it's a slower

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.510 
a lot of algae because it's a slower
growing<00:01:44.820> plant<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.200> how<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.220> grow<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
growing plant so how they can grow on a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999

faster<00:01:47.970> order<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.560> suck<00:01:49.860> at

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
faster order to go and they suck at
