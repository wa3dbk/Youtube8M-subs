00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
is a synthetic designed with durability

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.359 
is a synthetic designed with durability
in<00:01:33.719> mind<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.679> of<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.859> guys<00:01:34.950> asked<00:01:35.340> me

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in mind so a lot of you guys asked me

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
in mind so a lot of you guys asked me
what<00:01:35.609> shoes<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:35.909> gonna<00:01:36.149> last<00:01:36.389> me<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> couple<00:01:36.899> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
what shoes are gonna last me a couple of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.020 
what shoes are gonna last me a couple of
seasons<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> honestly<00:01:38.130> most<00:01:38.609> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> modern

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
seasons and honestly most of the modern

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
seasons and honestly most of the modern
shoes<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.509> not<00:01:39.659> designed<00:01:40.049> with<00:01:40.170> durability

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
shoes I'm not designed with durability

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
shoes I'm not designed with durability
in<00:01:40.829> mind<00:01:41.069> basically<00:01:41.639> the<00:01:41.939> durability<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.539> only

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
in mind basically the durability is only

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.629 
in mind basically the durability is only
achieved<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> build<00:01:43.799> quality<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
achieved here the build quality of the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.029 
achieved here the build quality of the
shoe<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.420> unlike<00:01:45.959> all<00:01:46.259> those<00:01:46.530> other<00:01:46.770> shoes

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
shoe but unlike all those other shoes

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.529 
shoe but unlike all those other shoes
this<00:01:47.280> she<00:01:47.459> was<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.909> designed<00:01:48.060> with

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
this she was actually designed with

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.239 
this she was actually designed with
build<00:01:48.810> quality<00:01:49.109> or<00:01:49.469> sorry<00:01:49.679> with<00:01:49.859> durability

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
build quality or sorry with durability

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.399 
build quality or sorry with durability
in<00:01:50.549> mind<00:01:50.819> so<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.840> shoe<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> last

in mind so they want this shoe the last

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
in mind so they want this shoe the last
a<00:01:52.560> long<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.249> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.670> expect<00:01:53.969> this<00:01:54.179> shoe

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

to last a long time and for the price

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.099 
to last a long time and for the price
you<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:56.939> can't<00:01:57.209> go<00:01:57.329> wrong<00:01:57.359> in<00:01:57.719> terms<00:01:57.929> of

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
you really can't go wrong in terms of

the price to lifetime ratio that you're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
the price to lifetime ratio that you're
gonna<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.109> out<00:02:01.289> of<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.529> lethal<00:02:01.829> stats<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.729> far

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gonna get out of the lethal stats as far

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.580 
gonna get out of the lethal stats as far
as<00:02:02.999> the<00:02:03.090> Rhino<00:02:03.270> skin<00:02:03.450> synthetic<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> concerned

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
as the Rhino skin synthetic is concerned

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.559 
as the Rhino skin synthetic is concerned
as<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> whole<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.639> a<00:02:05.789> synthetic<00:02:06.299> leather

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
as a whole it's a synthetic leather

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.359 
as a whole it's a synthetic leather
material<00:02:07.109> that<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.709> little<00:02:07.950> bit<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> extra

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
material that has a little bit of extra

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.979 
material that has a little bit of extra
padding<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.720> thin

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

synthetic if you want to say that and it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
synthetic if you want to say that and it
kind<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.689> is<00:02:12.900> more<00:02:13.200> designed

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
kind of more is more designed

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
kind of more is more designed

out<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.390> boot<00:02:33.570> which<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.110> somewhat

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
out of the boot which is somewhat

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.080 
out of the boot which is somewhat
unusual<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.280> feels<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.550> little<00:02:35.640> bit<00:02:35.850> weird

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
unusual and it feels a little bit weird

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610 
unusual and it feels a little bit weird
at<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.170> does<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> good<00:02:37.560> job

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
at first but it really does a good job

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.280 
at first but it really does a good job
of<00:02:37.920> securing<00:02:38.100> your<00:02:38.640> foot<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.000> place<00:02:39.290> which

and while it might seem like a lot of 10
millimeters<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.239> only<00:03:45.420> about<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.840> much<00:03:46.110> it's

shoe basically the reason why they

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
shoe basically the reason why they
included<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.320> 10<00:04:01.560> millimeter<00:04:01.980> heel

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
included this 10 millimeter heel

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
gradient is that it kind of repositions

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.110 
gradient is that it kind of repositions
your<00:04:04.799> joints<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.280> slightly<00:04:05.549> different<00:04:05.730> angles

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
your joints at slightly different angles

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.300 
your joints at slightly different angles
that<00:04:06.720> have<00:04:06.870> been<00:04:06.989> proven<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.410> reduce<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.100> risk

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that have been proven to reduce the risk

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.130 
that have been proven to reduce the risk
of<00:04:08.459> injury<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:09.810> unique<00:04:09.959> thing

of injury so it's a really unique thing
on<00:04:10.560> there<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.100> something<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.579> you'll
