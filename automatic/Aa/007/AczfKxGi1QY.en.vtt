00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
one that comes in the jewel case very
very<00:00:49.530> much<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.309> yeah<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.239> bigger<00:00:52.430> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
very much but yeah it's a bit bigger and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630 
very much but yeah it's a bit bigger and
they<00:00:54.270> each<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.350> same<00:00:55.379> three<00:00:55.920> sets<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
they each get the same three sets of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.680 
they each get the same three sets of
pictures<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.960> their<00:00:58.109> head<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:59.690> them

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
pictures one of their head and then them

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.619 
pictures one of their head and then them
three<00:01:01.079> times<00:01:01.289> multiplied<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.239> black<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
three times multiplied and a black and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.050 
three times multiplied and a black and
white<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> each<00:01:11.010> member<00:01:11.400> gets<00:01:11.580> those<00:01:11.760> three

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
white so each member gets those three

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:27.990 
white so each member gets those three
pictures

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.210

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
best way to hold it in because it's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.830
