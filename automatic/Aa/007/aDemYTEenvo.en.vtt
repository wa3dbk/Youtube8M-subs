with<00:00:32.290> these<00:00:32.439> you<00:00:32.650> know<00:00:32.800> that<00:00:32.980> they<00:00:33.160> have<00:00:33.370> a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
with these you know that they have a

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.600 
with these you know that they have a
tendency<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.600> leak<00:00:34.900> mount<00:00:35.530> there's<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.340> couple

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
tendency to leak mount there's a couple

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.729 
tendency to leak mount there's a couple
of<00:00:36.730> things<00:00:36.880> you<00:00:37.030> can<00:00:37.239> do<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.750> minimize<00:00:37.930> this

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
of things you can do to minimize this

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.310 
of things you can do to minimize this
effect<00:00:39.060> one<00:00:40.060> thing<00:00:40.300> is<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.630> not<00:00:40.810> over<00:00:41.079> torque

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
effect one thing is to not over torque

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.180 
effect one thing is to not over torque
the<00:00:41.440> bolts<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.820> typically<00:00:43.480> these<00:00:43.660> are

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the bolts because typically these are

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960 
the bolts because typically these are
3/16<00:00:45.190> or<00:00:45.480> quarter<00:00:46.480> inch<00:00:47.100> steel<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.460> they're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
3/16 or quarter inch steel and they're

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.530 
3/16 or quarter inch steel and they're
prone<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.480> bending<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.080> they'll<00:00:50.200> bend<00:00:50.880> at<00:00:51.880> the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
prone to bending and they'll bend at the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540 
prone to bending and they'll bend at the
points<00:00:52.960> where<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:53.230> put<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.590> bolts<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.340> you'll

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
points where you put the bolts so you'll

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.570 
points where you put the bolts so you'll
have<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.700> bend<00:00:55.390> right<00:00:56.230> here<00:00:56.620> down<00:00:57.550> here<00:00:58.740> so<00:00:59.740> one

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
have a bend right here down here so one

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.580 
have a bend right here down here so one
way<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.060> look<00:01:01.420> like<00:01:01.690> I<00:01:01.720> said<00:01:01.990> one<00:01:02.380> way<00:01:02.530> you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
way is you look like I said one way you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.799 
way is you look like I said one way you
can<00:01:02.710> minimize<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.730> don't<00:01:04.629> over

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
can minimize that is just don't over

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.679 
can minimize that is just don't over
torque<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.140> bolts<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:06.579> then<00:01:07.299> we<00:01:07.479> usually

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
torque the bolts and then we usually

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.170 
torque the bolts and then we usually
what<00:01:07.930> happens<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.710> gasket<00:01:09.250> burns<00:01:09.490> out<00:01:09.850> and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
what happens is the gasket burns out and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.510 
what happens is the gasket burns out and
you<00:01:10.659> crawl<00:01:10.900> you<00:01:11.320> can<00:01:11.470> hear<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.829> exhaust<00:01:12.250> leak

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
you crawl you can hear that exhaust leak

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.819 
you crawl you can hear that exhaust leak
or<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.119> smell<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.659> exhaust<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:14.680> get

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
or you can smell the exhaust you get

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.109 
or you can smell the exhaust you get
underneath<00:01:14.979> your<00:01:15.070> car<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.729> tighten<00:01:15.939> down

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
underneath your car and you tighten down

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.850 
underneath your car and you tighten down
these<00:01:16.360> bolts<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.869> get<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.170> impacts<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.710> you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
these bolts you get the impacts and you

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.800 
these bolts you get the impacts and you
torque<00:01:18.100> them<00:01:18.220> down<00:01:18.280> hoping<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.359> solves<00:01:19.689> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
torque them down hoping that solves the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.130 
torque them down hoping that solves the
problem<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.319> just<00:01:20.380> makes<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.280> worse<00:01:21.929> one<00:01:22.929> thing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
problem it just makes it worse one thing

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.279 
problem it just makes it worse one thing
you<00:01:23.229> could<00:01:23.350> do<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:24.780> depending<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.840> what<00:01:26.049> size

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
you could do is depending on what size

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.989 
you could do is depending on what size
your<00:01:26.789> exhaust<00:01:27.789> pipe<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:30.630> arm<00:01:32.819> sleeve<00:01:33.819> it

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
your exhaust pipe is is to arm sleeve it

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.709 
your exhaust pipe is is to arm sleeve it
so<00:01:34.719> that<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.439> have<00:01:35.469> an<00:01:35.859> effective

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
so that you have an effective

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.599 
so that you have an effective
effectively<00:01:37.740> you'll<00:01:38.740> have<00:01:38.889> a<00:01:38.920> pipe<00:01:39.249> within<00:01:39.490> a

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
effectively you'll have a pipe within a

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.330 
effectively you'll have a pipe within a
pipe<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.560> instance<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.159> your

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
pipe say for instance this is your

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.120 
pipe say for instance this is your
exhaust<00:01:42.670> pipe<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:44.409> could<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.679> leave<00:01:44.950> it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
exhaust pipe and you could just leave it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.649 
exhaust pipe and you could just leave it
like<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.670> can<00:01:45.819> put<00:01:45.969> it<00:01:46.060> inside<00:01:46.420> there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
like that you can put it inside there

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.139 
like that you can put it inside there
but<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> three<00:01:49.119> inch<00:01:50.549> exhaust<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:51.999> is

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
but this is a three inch exhaust this is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.569 
but this is a three inch exhaust this is
a<00:01:52.209> three<00:01:52.450> inch<00:01:52.630> pipe<00:01:53.049> here<00:01:53.709> and<00:01:54.009> this<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> two

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
a three inch pipe here and this is a two

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.109 
a three inch pipe here and this is a two
and<00:01:54.609> a<00:01:54.759> half<00:01:54.909> inch<00:01:55.179> pipe<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:56.139> there's<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.939> me<00:01:58.090> a

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
and a half inch pipe and there's so me a

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.469 
and a half inch pipe and there's so me a
leakage<00:01:59.579> what<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.670> other<00:02:00.789> thing<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.090> do<00:02:01.270> is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
leakage what the other thing you do is

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.389 
leakage what the other thing you do is
is<00:02:01.779> cut<00:02:02.499> this<00:02:02.709> off<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:04.859> make<00:02:05.859> a<00:02:05.889> thicker

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
is cut this off and make a thicker

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.340 
is cut this off and make a thicker
flange<00:02:06.789> one<00:02:07.149> that's<00:02:07.329> not<00:02:07.539> prone<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.840> bending

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
flange one that's not prone to bending

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.350 
flange one that's not prone to bending
you<00:02:08.500> said<00:02:08.770> half<00:02:09.130> inch<00:02:09.369> plate<00:02:09.700> or<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.650> 3/8<00:02:11.650> plate

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you said half inch plate or a 3/8 plate

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.730 
you said half inch plate or a 3/8 plate
but<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.540> still<00:02:13.780> need<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.020> make<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> cut<00:02:14.500> and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
but you still need to make a cut and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.180 
but you still need to make a cut and
then<00:02:14.890> reweld<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.640> together

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.040 

the<00:02:20.490> third<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.940> probably<00:02:21.210> best<00:02:21.360> alternative

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the third and probably best alternative

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.270 
the third and probably best alternative
is<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.590> get<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> ball<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.100> socket<00:02:23.520> joint<00:02:25.280> socket

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
is to get a ball and socket joint socket

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.540

or a ball and a socket joint this would

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.670 
or a ball and a socket joint this would
go<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.000> exhaust<00:02:30.270> side<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:31.290> was<00:02:31.500> going

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
go on the exhaust side this was going

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.670 
go on the exhaust side this was going
the<00:02:32.250> header<00:02:32.460> side<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.030> got<00:02:33.660> these<00:02:33.840> from<00:02:34.080> hooker

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the header side I got these from hooker

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.010 
the header side I got these from hooker
I<00:02:34.940> bought<00:02:35.940> these<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:38.360> few<00:02:39.360> years<00:02:39.570> ago<00:02:39.780> actually

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
I bought these a few years ago actually

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.320 
I bought these a few years ago actually
probably<00:02:40.740> about<00:02:40.890> seven<00:02:41.730> or<00:02:41.850> eight<00:02:41.880> years<00:02:41.940> ago

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
probably about seven or eight years ago

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.720 
probably about seven or eight years ago
I<00:02:42.450> bought<00:02:42.750> these<00:02:43.220> amounted<00:02:44.220> amount<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.520> SATA

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I bought these amounted amount of SATA

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.370 
I bought these amounted amount of SATA
headers<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.300> had<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> small<00:02:45.900> block<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
headers that I had a small block in the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.810 
headers that I had a small block in the
85<00:02:46.680> Chevy<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.640> sold<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.670> that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
85 Chevy that I just sold and in that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.180 
85 Chevy that I just sold and in that
project<00:02:51.030> anyway<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:52.260> project<00:02:52.680> took<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.890> turn

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
project anyway that project took a turn

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.730 
project anyway that project took a turn
and<00:02:53.660> ended<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.810> scrapping<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.290> headers<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
and ended up scrapping the headers and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.380 
and ended up scrapping the headers and
keeping<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.070> collectors<00:02:56.520> oh<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:59.460> what's<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
keeping the collectors oh so what's the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600 
keeping the collectors oh so what's the
best<00:03:00.570> way<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.750> make<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> cut<00:03:01.290> well<00:03:01.530> most<00:03:02.490> guys

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
best way to make the cut well most guys

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.610 
best way to make the cut well most guys
would<00:03:03.000> grab<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.330> hacksaw<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> toolbox<00:03:04.410> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
would grab the hacksaw the toolbox and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.190 
would grab the hacksaw the toolbox and
start<00:03:05.010> sawing<00:03:05.310> away<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:07.080> once

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
start sawing away this and then once

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720 
start sawing away this and then once
they<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.410> halfway<00:03:07.650> through<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.280> saw<00:03:08.490> wood

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
they got halfway through the saw wood

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
they got halfway through the saw wood
does<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.240> blade<00:03:09.420> would<00:03:09.600> probably<00:03:09.870> break<00:03:10.080> or

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
does the blade would probably break or

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.700 
does the blade would probably break or
the<00:03:10.710> solid<00:03:11.430> break<00:03:11.810> or<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> gives<00:03:13.050> sawzall<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
the solid break or it gives sawzall and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.410 
the solid break or it gives sawzall and
you<00:03:13.890> go<00:03:14.040> through<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.790> by<00:03:15.000> halfway

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you go through and get by halfway

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.230 
you go through and get by halfway
through<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:17.190> blade<00:03:17.700> wouldn't<00:03:17.970> be<00:03:18.030> long

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
through and the blade wouldn't be long

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.900 
through and the blade wouldn't be long
enough<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.130> Jam<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.310> blade<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.790> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
enough and you Jam the blade and it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
enough and you Jam the blade and it
would<00:03:21.030> Bend<00:03:21.300> already<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> torch<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:22.890> make

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
would Bend already get a torch you make

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
would Bend already get a torch you make
a<00:03:23.070> really<00:03:23.250> buggered<00:03:23.670> up<00:03:23.760> cut<00:03:24.260> or<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
a really buggered up cut or you get a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.460 
a really buggered up cut or you get a
cut<00:03:25.740> off<00:03:25.860> wheel<00:03:26.100> make<00:03:26.400> cut<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:27.930> invariably

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
cut off wheel make cut but invariably

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.030 
cut off wheel make cut but invariably
you<00:03:29.010> never<00:03:29.280> end<00:03:29.520> up<00:03:29.670> with<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> nice<00:03:30.090> square<00:03:30.420> cut

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
you never end up with a nice square cut

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.830 
you never end up with a nice square cut
so<00:03:32.040> what<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.460> ended<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:32.910> doing<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.510> I've<00:03:33.630> seen

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
so what I ended up doing and I've seen

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.810 
so what I ended up doing and I've seen
these<00:03:33.990> before<00:03:39.950> they<00:03:40.950> got<00:03:41.070> one<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.370> these<00:03:41.490> and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
these before they got one of these and

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.870 
these before they got one of these and
basically<00:03:42.980> you've<00:03:43.980> got<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.250> series<00:03:44.850> of

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
basically you've got a series of

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.610 
basically you've got a series of
hardened<00:03:45.540> cutters<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> daisy<00:03:47.940> chain<00:03:48.620> you

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
hardened cutters on a daisy chain you

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.880 
hardened cutters on a daisy chain you
can<00:03:49.740> adjust<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> size<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.709> pipe

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
can adjust it to the size of the pipe

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.960 
can adjust it to the size of the pipe
that<00:03:52.920> you're<00:03:53.250> using<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:55.580> spring<00:03:56.580> so

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
that you're using and you just spring so

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.580 
that you're using and you just spring so
it's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.150> little<00:03:57.330> tight<00:03:57.510> yet<00:03:57.690> crank<00:03:58.350> down<00:03:58.530> on

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
it's a little tight yet crank down on

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.300 
it's a little tight yet crank down on
that<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.280> pair<00:03:59.580> vise<00:03:59.850> grips<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:01.070> rock<00:04:02.070> this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that like pair vise grips and rock this

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.090 
that like pair vise grips and rock this
back<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.790> forth<00:04:02.880> until<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.050> makes<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.380> cut<00:04:04.620> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
back and forth until it makes a cut and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.270 
back and forth until it makes a cut and
it<00:04:05.580> makes<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.850> nice<00:04:06.000> clean<00:04:06.840> square<00:04:07.800> cut<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
it makes a nice clean square cut and a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400 
it makes a nice clean square cut and a
good<00:04:08.520> great<00:04:08.850> advantage<00:04:09.240> of<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:10.380> can

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
good great advantage of this is you can

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.740 
good great advantage of this is you can
use<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.920> underneath<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.490> car<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.030> in

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
use this underneath the car and in

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.330 
use this underneath the car and in
really<00:04:12.900> tight<00:04:13.200> spaces<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.890> only<00:04:14.070> need<00:04:14.310> a

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
really tight spaces you only need a

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.580 
really tight spaces you only need a
little<00:04:14.430> bit<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.910> throw<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:16.109> actually<00:04:16.440> make

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
little bit of a throw to actually make

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.770 
little bit of a throw to actually make
the<00:04:16.739> cut<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.250> makes<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.609> nice<00:04:17.820> clean<00:04:18.270> cut<00:04:18.540> you

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the cut and makes a nice clean cut you

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.680 
the cut and makes a nice clean cut you
don't<00:04:18.900> end<00:04:19.170> up<00:04:19.790> shaking<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.060> exhaust<00:04:21.390> all<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
don't end up shaking the exhaust all the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.120 
don't end up shaking the exhaust all the
heck<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.170> get<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> bunch<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.680> crap<00:04:22.920> in<00:04:22.950> your

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
heck and get a bunch of crap in your

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.760 
heck and get a bunch of crap in your
eyes<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:24.570> just<00:04:24.780> makes<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.110> nice<00:04:25.230> clean<00:04:25.530> cuts

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
