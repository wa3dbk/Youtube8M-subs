00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 hi all ages are not found in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.510
 a new video still announces between 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 him and a new nuclear on his 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.900
 dolphin clermont it's sir clients 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.320
 nevertheless if a gentleman v6 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 couchepin 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 and it's also a bit special since 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 I have no stone of the coup I had to pick up 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.029
 some but I want to gain one 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.760
 right now that's after the gameplay 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.859
 it's just to interest you a little 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 more video because I have full 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.040
 lots of stuff coming firstly we 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 let's start with millennium for 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 those who do not know and if you do not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.829
 befits not on twitter I advise you 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 really disappointed because now I 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 stress in millenium 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180
 almost every day are going to the one who 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 like the friday saturday sunday 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 I will not be but Monday I will resume 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 at 14 hours normally but all 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 days just rhymes almost 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 and I say it on my site is sure it's 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 that I say sir smile because I 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.329
 go every time just rim people 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.590
 see a link like that can click 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.140
 on it directly it's on the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.149
 millenium tv number 3 I know because 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 when gotaga was at millennium is 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.780
 streamed on that and the ja the pro team the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.580
 code on xbox that also trim on 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.330
 so I also have my title and layer on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.350
 a challenge trying to have the 100 nuclear 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.610
 before call of duty kid so that's it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.830
 can be easy and not easy 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.090
 and for that they slept as a result 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.439
 is that I need players to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.150
 but trees and pickups and stuff 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.159
 like that not that I can speak in 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 a microphone and for me to unlock 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.150
 nuclear more easily and a little 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 faster so that it does not take 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.710
 not kind that I managed his challenge too 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 where I come back from knowing if there are people 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 who are ready to play just really 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 to help me to make me 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 nuclear is just sending me 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.640
 shutter microphones all that is also 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.320
 if they are there regularly enough that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 I always have about the same team 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 we have a little agreement that we 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.620
 years old gives roles and that's okay 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 easier we are here 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.500
 you want to play together and I know to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.510
 who you are a good level who is a step 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 too much my level so that's his 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.030
 private chapel that nuclear 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.790
 come more easily and that I 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 can chain nuclear that I 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.490
 I'm three and it's been four days since 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.310
 I delete 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.480
 so it's not at all enough if I 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.060
 want to succeed my challenge so that's why 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.400
 that I am you thought to be pretty 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.220
 good to see the unravel of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 nuclear to write VSATs and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 drones see this is not sent a 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.470
 message on twitter with what's the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.790
 steam and buy me on steam I 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.620
 would like to just added 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.330
 and so I could stop you 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.810
 when I stream should besides I 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.980
 sends you a message via steam to little 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.090
 almost half an hour before I 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 start the stream to get started 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.250
 Okay 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.720
 I wish I had my team from the beginning 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.000
 like that I spend two three parts 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.210
 where there is nobody and eksi a loss of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.490
 time we will basically say what 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.050
 I wanted to tell you is that at the base 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.310
 this video should not be a 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.070
 video can still interest to forget the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.040
 the usb and bluetooth key that allows me 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.660
 to use my brightened smile suddenly 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.480
 I use a mouse and my iphone 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.130
 will make that keyboard so I can not 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.300
 do more and that's fine there 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.130
 make a montage without a keyboard because 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.209
 always need touch and just like 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.530
 that's why I'm doing that or 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.940
 this video to tell us that already 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.070
 justin on millennium for those who 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.709
 would not have known that I'm back 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.260
 but that the videos are a bit more 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.970
 hard to achieve after a game of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.650
 realized time too and that my next 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.300
 video should be a best-of game 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.500
 Armagnac I've already done I believe 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.330
 that I already have three seasons I thought 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.470
 that the town hall only two days and 3 and 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.730
 so I'm going to make you a little best-of 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.440
 of ravaillac then I will do 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.500
 how to make a nuclear on the skull 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.940
 2025 sam was pretty much asking for that and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.070
 then I will also resume the games 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.690
 armagnac the last nuclear routes 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.660
 and the nuclear fire comoros are all 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.540
 the mavs I hope to finish this series that 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.430
 you have kids there so 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.379
 then chained on call of duty hump 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.810
 with new maps and all 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.129
 new games also our hands speaking 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.900
 new games I wanted to know if 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.790
 you were interested in other games 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.799
 I think if you are a title that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.530
 you are interested in fifa 14 on 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.390
 is really more interested in parker 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.470
 of most but nalaga a few 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.150
 who told me anything it will be interesting 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.540
 to see on other games than call of 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.920
 duty because it 's game time I 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.269
 feels me and wondered if I wanted 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.919
 do a second home not for the 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.039
 milk on the game so I 'll see if 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.470
 I'll have time I'll see how it goes 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:26.240
 commits the games are and how how 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.470
 evolution of games and youtube 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.449
 how are the menus on that what about 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.490
 youtube and on the on the new games 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.910
 for to draw if I take a 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.150
 second bad chain random game or 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.720
 coupat is also i will talk to you 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.130
 another thing and this is it 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.389
 this is my last body interests I do not 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.729
 can do more of as interest as 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.320
 this basic is true that I am a 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.479
 gameplay behind and stuff like that 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.630
 or just show to ebbo gameplay or 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.940
 in the evening his presence and that everything 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.780
 the world is doing that it's getting pretty 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.659
 repetitive 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.789
 that does not make you want to do it because 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:06.360
 that after two to three hundred 300 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.159
 as landed I made almost 400 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.340
 videos we 300 comments and I'm 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.110
 Say it's more like it gives more 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.190
 want it to become repetitive ya not 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.900
 something new 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.949
 me personally when I am these 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.260
 videos I always want to learn 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.190
 something to do a trick of 9 the 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.990
 do different things 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.060
 if for that right now I'm not 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.650
 a lot of different stuff like I 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.330
 tried their after last video on the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.750
 nuclear road 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.750
 I was the traitor is very mediocre 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.720
 maybe that's mediocre 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.490
 in any case level song after my 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.890
 lyrics I think it left that 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.720
 there was the army fired after me 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.550
 I have no rhythm of the coup I am null in 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.360
 music I do not know how to sing would have me 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.280
 it took a singer but hey but I 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.600
 tempted I told myself why not one does not 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.030
 never know who does not try anything nothing 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.170
 and also I have nothing to do with it 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.340
 also a big child a good reason 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.780
 for which I had succeeded 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.490
 and here we also expect that I'm a 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.470
 little style for anyone who wants 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.960
 more hype and where I do 2 3 kg is 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.730
 in the nuclear series had not 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.100
 really bad I think it was not 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.870
 badly then I develop nuclear 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.770
 it's a clear thing that I did in 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.090
 live on the millenium chain if you 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.320
 want to go to see now there is 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.720
 no rebroadcast but we will soon 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.800
 reruns that's for sure and there 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.120
 just look at two minutes I do not know 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.700
 not how are I not going to look at you 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.200
 and see I'm on it's the back 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.460
 do I think it's because I'm 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.080
 I squat while doing it 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.370
 does the syria trunk like sita mos 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.840
 buddies anyway here I hope that 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.350
 life will not have pleased you and it's not the 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.510
 monkeys m 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.250

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.090
 do not want to boney m steeple on twitter 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.500
 to know when do I

 expresses myself bless
