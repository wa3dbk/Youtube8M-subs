who<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.210> guessing<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> start<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
who I'm guessing is going to start in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.049 
who I'm guessing is going to start in
place<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> Bryant<00:01:02.340> McKinney<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.820> away

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
place the Bryant McKinney right away

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.840 
place the Bryant McKinney right away
because<00:01:03.270> he's<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> non<00:01:04.769> football<00:01:05.369> injury

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
because he's on the non football injury

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
because he's on the non football injury
list<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:07.170> honestly<00:01:07.380> couldn't<00:01:07.860> care<00:01:07.979> less

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
list and I honestly couldn't care less

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
list and I honestly couldn't care less
because<00:01:08.640> he<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> most<00:01:09.390> overrated<00:01:09.840> player

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
because he is the most overrated player

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.499 
because he is the most overrated player
in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> NFL<00:01:11.780> period<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:14.060> he<00:01:15.060> spends<00:01:15.360> way<00:01:15.479> too

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
in the NFL period and he spends way too

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
in the NFL period and he spends way too
much<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.259> Twitter<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.070> enough<00:01:17.310> time

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
much time on Twitter and not enough time

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
much time on Twitter and not enough time
learning<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> block<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.619> seen<00:01:19.619> by<00:01:19.799> Brett

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
learning how to block as seen by Brett

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
learning how to block as seen by Brett
Favre<00:01:20.400> getting<00:01:20.729> destroyed<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> last<00:01:21.570> two

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Favre getting destroyed the last two

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
Favre getting destroyed the last two
seasons<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.549> hopefully<00:01:23.549> Charlie<00:01:23.970> Johnson

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
seasons so hopefully Charlie Johnson

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
seasons so hopefully Charlie Johnson
shows<00:01:24.600> him<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.140> some<00:01:25.380> football<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
shows him how to play some football and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
shows him how to play some football and
keeps<00:01:26.250> taunting<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> McNab<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.210> his<00:01:27.299> feet<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
keeps taunting the McNab on his feet and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.039 
keeps taunting the McNab on his feet and
then<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.759> many<00:01:29.820> people<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
then how many people you think on the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
then how many people you think on the
first<00:01:31.200> day<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> Madden<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> comes<00:01:32.759> out

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
first day of Madden when that comes out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.460 
first day of Madden when that comes out
are<00:01:33.060> gonna<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> Philadelphia<00:01:34.409> Eagles

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
are gonna be at the Philadelphia Eagles

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
are gonna be at the Philadelphia Eagles
I<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:36.150> cannot<00:01:36.780> believe<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.740> these

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I I cannot believe they got all these

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.100 
I I cannot believe they got all these
players<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> hundred<00:01:39.750> mill

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
players and are not like a hundred mill

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.469 
players and are not like a hundred mill
over<00:01:40.439> cap<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.299> pretty

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
over cap so it's gonna be pretty

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
over cap so it's gonna be pretty
interesting<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:44.040> do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
interesting to see how well they do

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.580 
interesting to see how well they do
actually<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.880> coming<00:01:45.210> season<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.810> teams
