00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

like this one as much as I like the
other<00:02:24.630> two<00:02:24.930> especially<00:02:25.800> when<00:02:25.920> everyone<00:02:26.160> else

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
other two especially when everyone else

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.740 
other two especially when everyone else
in<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> world<00:02:26.820> seems<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> regard<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
in the world seems to regard it as a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.990 
in the world seems to regard it as a
masterpiece<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.770> don't<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.430> maybe<00:02:29.670> there's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
masterpiece I don't know maybe there's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.870 
masterpiece I don't know maybe there's
too<00:02:30.330> much<00:02:30.570> focus<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.380> trying<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.190> out

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
too much focus on them trying to get out

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.060 
too much focus on them trying to get out
maybe<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.300> daycare<00:02:33.840> center<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.860> too

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
maybe the daycare center is a little too

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.700 
maybe the daycare center is a little too
ugly<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> place<00:02:36.300> not<00:02:36.720> fun<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.620> around

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
ugly a place not fun to really be around

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.440 
ugly a place not fun to really be around
which<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.400> they're<00:02:38.670> taking<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> darker

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
which I know they're taking a darker

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
which I know they're taking a darker
turn<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> second<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.710> sort<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.040> did<00:02:41.220> too

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
turn but the second one sort of did too

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.400 
turn but the second one sort of did too
and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:41.880> still<00:02:42.030> enjoyable<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.170> think

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and it was still enjoyable when I think

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.960 
and it was still enjoyable when I think
of<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.590> movie<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> lot<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.490> grays

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
of this movie I think of a lot of grays

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.720 
of this movie I think of a lot of grays
and<00:02:45.000> greens<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:46.200> yellows<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.520> very

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and greens and yellows and just not very

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850 
and greens and yellows and just not very
pleasant<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.570> could<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.140> used<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.620> few<00:02:49.650> more

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
pleasant I could have used a few more

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.430 
pleasant I could have used a few more
jokes<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.490> maybe<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.910> quite<00:02:51.300> as<00:02:51.810> much<00:02:51.840> drama

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
jokes and maybe not quite as much drama

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.890 
jokes and maybe not quite as much drama
well<00:02:53.400> maybe<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.330> balanced<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.810> out

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
well maybe if they just balanced it out

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.830 
well maybe if they just balanced it out
a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.170> bit<00:02:55.410> more<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.330> okay<00:02:57.330> I'll<00:02:57.480> address

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.560 
grown man acting this way I can see even
a<00:03:19.230> little<00:03:19.440> child<00:03:19.980> acting<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.730> way<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.420> the

I<00:03:35.700> still<00:03:36.030> can't<00:03:36.209> believe<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.480> gave<00:03:36.540> away<00:03:36.750> all<00:03:36.810> my

ninja<00:03:37.290> turtle<00:03:37.530> toys<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> hell<00:03:38.250> those

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
ninja turtle toys what the hell those

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.530 
ninja turtle toys what the hell those

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.220 
but that's the thing I still gave him
away<00:03:41.370> think<00:03:42.060> about<00:03:42.120> when<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.690> gave<00:03:42.930> away<00:03:43.200> your

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.170 
away think about when you gave away your
toys<00:03:43.620> was<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.070> really<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.610> heartbreaking

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
toys was it really this heartbreaking

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.509 
toys was it really this heartbreaking
probably<00:03:46.049> not<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.650> stuff<00:03:46.860> happens<00:03:47.340> when

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
probably not this stuff happens when

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.280 
probably not this stuff happens when
you're<00:03:47.640> much<00:03:47.850> older<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.510> when<00:03:48.900> you're<00:03:49.019> around

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
you're much older and when you're around

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
you're much older and when you're around
this<00:03:49.440> age<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.890> don't<00:03:50.010> have<00:03:50.280> as<00:03:50.489> many<00:03:50.850> concerns

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
this age you don't have as many concerns

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.420 
this age you don't have as many concerns
about<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.810> past<00:03:52.080> this<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.920> more<00:03:53.100> for<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
about the past this is more for like a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.850 
about the past this is more for like a
midlife<00:03:53.850> crisis<00:03:54.480> now<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.350> point<00:03:55.620> came

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
midlife crisis now if the point came

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.560 
midlife crisis now if the point came
where<00:03:56.040> he<00:03:56.100> had<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.400> get<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.700> toys<00:03:56.880> away<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.480> he

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
where he had to get the toys away and he

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.600 
where he had to get the toys away and he
paused<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.350> second<00:03:58.769> maybe<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.430> would

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
paused for a second maybe that would

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.490 
paused for a second maybe that would
have<00:03:59.730> been<00:03:59.880> more<00:04:00.060> powerful<00:04:00.269> maybe<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.170> he<00:04:01.260> just

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
have been more powerful maybe if he just

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.890 
have been more powerful maybe if he just
gave<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.739> second<00:04:02.340> look<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.970> then<00:04:03.299> decide<00:04:03.750> to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
gave a second look and then decide to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.810 
gave a second look and then decide to
hand<00:04:04.049> them<00:04:04.230> over<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.769> good<00:04:05.190> lore<00:04:05.400> he<00:04:05.610> goes

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
hand them over but good lore he goes

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.180 
hand them over but good lore he goes
through<00:04:06.090> every<00:04:06.600> toy<00:04:06.900> has<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> description<00:04:07.860> for

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
address the moment that was building up

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.680 
address the moment that was building up
in<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.280> other<00:04:38.490> films<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:39.030> does<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.450> very

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
in the other films it does have a very

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.320 
in the other films it does have a very
satisfactory<00:04:40.500> conclusion<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:42.000> a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
satisfactory conclusion it's just a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.690 
satisfactory conclusion it's just a
little<00:04:42.840> indulgent<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:43.770> times<00:04:44.040> at<00:04:44.370> least<00:04:44.490> for
