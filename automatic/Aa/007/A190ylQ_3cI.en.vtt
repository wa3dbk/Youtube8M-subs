00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.570
 hello everyone we go today 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.119
 take an interest in the operation of the peak 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.910
 gun mhp 2 so first a small 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.739
 product presentation so the mhp 2 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.559
 is provided in a briefcase 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.920
 transport and this briefcase contains 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.989
 of course the pic gun mhp 2 you 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 can already see the size extremely 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.920
 scaled down 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.899
 accompanied by two batteries what is 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 a significant advantage since it 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.940
 allows you to recharge the batteries 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.190
 on usb port with the moon his guards 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 during an intervention or between two 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 interventions 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.159
 the charger of course as well as 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.839
 different heads of pipes that go 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.579
 therefore serve for the use of 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.859
 the tool of the dynamometric trainer 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.480
 which is on the other hand here he is not 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.999
 not directly supplied with the tool 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.409
 but it is almost indispensable 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.210
 for the use of a sheath spike 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.340
 electrical 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.010
 we will now take a closer look 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 at the operation of this pic gun and the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.450
 see in real situation 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.720
 but after seeing a little what 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.450
 was the contents of the peak's briefcase 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.240
 gun mhp 2 let's see now how 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.160
 so use it any soul to use one 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.480
 accessory like every time and epic 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.340
 electric games and coach 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.110
 dynamometric why a coach 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 dynamometric rather than a coach 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.850
 classic simply because it allows 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.890
 to position yourself well inside 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.330
 the lock and have a catch at the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.760
 times from the top and the bottom 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.740
 gold as the gun peak tends to hit 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.110
 relatively strong inside the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 cylinder very often a coach 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.950
 classic is ejected before we have the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.480
 time to complete the hooking so the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.600
 dynamometric allows to overcome this 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.220
 problem so we'll insert our 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.290
 dynamometric trainer what has been 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.670
 done then we insert the blade of 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.900
 the pointed out by paying attention to this 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.000
 it comes very touching 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 pins which is often a mistake 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.700
 of beginner and then my support on the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.700
 button 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.450
 here I have opened my 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.250
 first if one is going to do 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 a few in a row to have fun a 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.660
 little bit so you excuse me but for 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.940
 do not upset the susceptibilities all 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.950
 our eyelashes were masked at the level of the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.150
 mare just know what are the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.490
 cylinders of major French brands 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.490
 found on most 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.830
 buildings in France 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.190
 So here we test on a second 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 signal 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.800
 here again I go madam I do 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.240
 attention from the start to the end 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.240
 of course the gossip 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.570
 yeah 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.379
 me the hand silence no doubt of 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:11.920
 better quality but who did when 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:22.750
 not even a very long time 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:29.769
 on a third cylinder there the weather 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.480
 is much more limited and 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.689
 we will still make one or two for the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.689
 road 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.079
 even more and finally one last but I 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.689
 think you're already defeated from 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.400
 the utility especially of the effectiveness of this 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.930
 small tool 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.909
 so here we are on a cylinder a little 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.909
 little older relatively grime and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.959
 we could see the dynamometric trainer 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.630
 jumped out of his dwelling if that which 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.490
 would already be produced several times 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.490
 if we had used a coach out 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.720
 here 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.030
 and even though the pins here was a 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.440
 little more dirty you see that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.039
 the opening did not pose too much 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.800
 problems 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.470
 in conclusion we can therefore say that the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.349
 peak of mhp 2 is a tool that is when 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.720
 even a must-have for the locksmith 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.580
 convenience store today if a kenna tool 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.530
 extremely small footprint and 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.120
 thanks to its two batteries that are 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.190
 rechargeable in addition to usb 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.870
 it's really something that 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.909
 you can keep our truck is 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.650
 used daily in 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.199
 intervention without you 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.599
 default i hope this little video 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.220
 of presentation will have pleased you and I will 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.220
 see you soon for a next video
