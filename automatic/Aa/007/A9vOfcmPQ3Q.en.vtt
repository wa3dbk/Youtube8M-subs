some lead through and a piece that
you're<00:00:29.519> doing<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you're doing you can take this and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
able to see a definite difference in the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.530 
able to see a definite difference in the
sheen<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.550> would<00:02:09.760> take<00:02:10.030> your<00:02:10.270> brush

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and then just hit the places where where

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.980 
and then just hit the places where where
you<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.740> that<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.370> more<00:02:15.670> dry<00:02:16.060> looking<00:02:16.630> for

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
it will help it will protect the finish

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.690 
it will help it will protect the finish
so<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:39.540> satin<00:02:40.540> clear<00:02:40.900> coat<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
so that is the satin clear coat the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.780 
so that is the satin clear coat the
satin<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.070> also<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
satin right there so then we also have a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.930 
satin right there so then we also have a
lost<00:02:46.270> clear<00:02:46.840> coat<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.980> course<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.730> many

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
lost clear coat of course not as many

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
lost clear coat of course not as many
people<00:02:49.330> are<00:02:49.450> going<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.810> using<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> gloss

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
people are going to be using the gloss

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.160 
people are going to be using the gloss
because<00:02:50.950> really<00:02:51.610> though<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.480> look<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:53.020> this

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
because really though the look of this

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.670 
because really though the look of this
paint<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.830> more<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.400> rustic<00:02:54.940> look<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.680> there

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
paint is more of a rustic look but there

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.620 
paint is more of a rustic look but there
are<00:02:56.890> people<00:02:57.100> who<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.180> have<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> little

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
are people who do like to have a little

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.030 
are people who do like to have a little
more<00:02:58.959> shine<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> we've<00:03:01.060> got<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.450> gloss<00:03:01.750> finish

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
more shine so we've got the gloss finish

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.810 
more shine so we've got the gloss finish
this<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> very<00:03:03.820> different<00:03:04.650> consistency

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
this is a very different consistency

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.990 
this is a very different consistency
it's<00:03:06.820> more<00:03:07.180> watery<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.700> know<00:03:09.820> some

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it's more watery and you know some

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.830 
it's more watery and you know some
people<00:03:10.030> thin<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.780> runny<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.770> very<00:03:12.160> thin<00:03:12.840> but

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
people thin and runny it's very thin but

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.110 
people thin and runny it's very thin but
it's<00:03:14.080> still<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> same<00:03:14.709> principle<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.880> just

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
it's still the same principle you just

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.550 
it's still the same principle you just
dip<00:03:16.480> your<00:03:16.720> brush<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:18.090> little<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.640> work<00:03:21.640> it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
dip your brush in little and work it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.940 
dip your brush in little and work it
painted-on<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.959> don't<00:03:26.140> really<00:03:26.379> have<00:03:26.769> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
painted-on you don't really have to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.150 
painted-on you don't really have to
worry<00:03:27.310> about<00:03:27.480> overworking<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
worry about overworking this because it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.930 
worry about overworking this because it
is<00:03:30.400> thin<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:31.120> goes<00:03:31.330> on<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:32.019> lot<00:03:32.230> easier<00:03:32.769> but<00:03:33.670> this

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
is thin it goes on a lot easier but this

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.390 
is thin it goes on a lot easier but this
will<00:03:34.209> give<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.840> much<00:03:35.200> more<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.950> shiny

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
will give you much more of a shiny

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.350 
will give you much more of a shiny
finish<00:03:38.099> when<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.280> dries<00:03:39.959> whereas<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.200> satin

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
finish when it dries whereas the satin

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.660 
finish when it dries whereas the satin
will<00:03:43.360> give<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.810> more<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.319> buffed<00:03:44.590> finish<00:03:45.250> so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
will give you more of a buffed finish so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.339 
will give you more of a buffed finish so
