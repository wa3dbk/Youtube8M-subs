00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.930
 [Music] 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.110
 ah 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.460
 as you can see it's really not much 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.440
 coffee or a lot of water you are going to say 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.460
 the color according to the coffee they want 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.650
 put in this case then leave it well 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.430
 let's start let's start painting 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.430
 paper 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.510
 well here I already took a bit of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.000
 coffee blend I'm going to squeeze a little 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.410
 in a left like this if I want 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.449
 take a little more that is more 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.909
 dark, it's just a very cousin 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.489
 little bit and all you have to do is 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.640
 start painting the sheet in this case I 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.120
 I'm going to start tapping 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.910
 I'm not going to paint it like that so it looks 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 more the texture and it looks much better the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.590
 finishing paper m 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:31.579
 [Music] 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.930
 well I will finish both sides 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.960
 Now I'm just going to wait 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.180
 some parts like these dry and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.030
 Now I'm coming back with you, because here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.000
 I already have the dry leaf and now what 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.320
 let's do is burn the banks with 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.170
 You can be very careful with a 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.259
 lighter that is what I recommend or 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.710
 but with a match so with what 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.899
 you already want and with great care 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.899
 let's start burning by giving it shape 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.400
 and we blow 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:12.539
 and we try again before part 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.539
 [Music] 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.760
 and that's how we have our paper and 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.130
 aged burned down the banks to me 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.990
 it makes me very father, you just have to 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.760
 be very careful not to go over 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.690
 burnt and obviously not burn 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 true but that's how we 're doing 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.790
 to see the second option to see if 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.790
 they also like 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.260
 and what we are going to do is pour 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.260
 soluble coffee 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.840
 in the bucket enough to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.840
 paint here I'm also going to reuse this 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.349
 and if we need it, we'll go back to 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.069
 place a little more will mix 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.069
 with our fingers 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.000
 and that's how we have the water 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.710
 painted if you want to add more 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.110
 color or more coffee so they can 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.670
 do I'm going to leave it this way and 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.670
 Now the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.840
 add the sheet and dip the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.730
 I'm going to take out the sheet 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.980
 and I'm going to leave it in a plastic if 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.280
 You want to wrinkle me like that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.360
 I 'll leave it ready and I have the sheet 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 wet and concentrate a little bit of water in 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.680
 the folds that are made when 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 this is drying up what he's going to do 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.790
 is to paint both sides so we're going to 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.250
 only wait for it to dry 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.200
 our plastic and now we come back and 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.600
 that's how we have this second 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.519
 option here maybe it is not enough to 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.350
 see but good we have the edges a 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.720
 little darker which gives it a finish 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.370
 very father also what personal I like 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.190
 more in this way but good you 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 have to decide the two options and 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 good so you do not have a little more how 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.130
 there are the edges I have here this sheet 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.530
 in this case this sheet 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.720
 I wet a little more and wrinkle by 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.969
 that 's this way and concentrated 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.860
 a little more the color on the edges 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.379
 and that's how we have our two 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.839
 little leafs the two options I hope that 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.389
 really like it are two ways 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:52.449
 unique that although they are not very novel 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.309
 They give a very nice touch to your letter what 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.079
 what could they do to deliver them good 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:58.079
 is to make the roll 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.440
 in this way that selling her husband is 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.830
 very nice or they can do the same 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.350
 with what I did with the water do it with 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.050
 an envelope and deliver the letter with a 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.360
 about is also very much in the 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.030
 be supporting me by being commenting and 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.560
 follow me please on facebook follow me 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.020

 channel or also on twitter I'll leave 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.070
 in the information box all my 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.070
 data and we're seeing goodbye 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.230
 I already have the bucket with water now what 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.720
 only I'm going to do is good I decided 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.550
 paint my red sheet I'm going to 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.590
 use four droplets 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.300
 you are going to decide with the droplets the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.480
 intensity of color you want is missing 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.980
 is to add the sheet will be like 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.980
 rosita like red 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.950
 Here I have the sheet and I took it out and 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.090
 I'm going to leave here in this place drying 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.090
 so there is a little more 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.750
 concentrated the color and right now 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.750
 [Music] 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.750
 nothing
