 already in the place was elected president of ecuador and 1998 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.750
 to save the critical condition inherited from previous governments 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 particularly of the management of abdalá bucarám and of fabián alarcón 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 imposed economic conditions nothing of ropes for this country 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.930
 but managua will be remembered forever 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.820
 like the captain who sunk the ship in a sea of ​​Haitian perimetration 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.910
 entreguismo 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.750
 poverty and corruption 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.190
 during his administration in Ecuador the worst case of corruption occurred 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 who is known as 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.360

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.290
 percent 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.780
 in the bank robbery they took eight thousand 300 million dollars that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.820
 they did return the money 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.540
 through article 42 of the constitution of the republic that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.730
 never approved in previous assembly 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.040
 I have the records who assaulted could show that that was never approved 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.410
 but it appeared published in which it says that the state reports 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 God of the account holders of savers with a bank already in the process of 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.050
 settlement 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 also go and is everywhere is protected by him has said his 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.930
 decision can not be 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.670
 you even have to vote 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.420
 in the year 1998 when the law of chess was created 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.979
 there was an article that I finished that you could follow coercive actions 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.150
 to the owners of the main banks 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.710
 recently fulfilled if they had disappeared 1,800 million in the case 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 from a single bank 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.300
 in the team to twenty to pay 600 years of diets the national congress 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.380
 it turns out that the finished article allowed to go to his active son 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.959
 they eliminated took out of the law 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.299
 so that nobody removes the television channels for example such 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.270
 it was not but the result 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.979
 in this way he explains 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.269
 p 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.919
 between them 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:25.699
 p by the state of the regulatory and control decisions by the 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:26.949
 Bank System 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:31.889
 think that in the year 2007 Mr. Jesus Durán ballén subsidiaries mentions 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.479
 what should be expressed 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.979
 this mister abel 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.739
 changed the rules of the game 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.749
 in what refers to the banking control 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.100
 the law is the law of the previous financial system 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.180
 allowed some extra some controls like intervention 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.789
 immediate from a bank 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.569
 stopped if a problem was detected 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.179
 et 11 but the man the sector has failed with his neoliberal policy 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.939
 in the same way that banks are careful to control that the market regulates 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.450
 the market falls, the financial market regulates everything 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.099
 and then under the controls and allowed themselves to shoot him 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.799
 against this car controls 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.309
 -sector valley was the manager 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.399
 of the biggest assault that has happened in the country 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:25.049
 in the year 1992 more than five billion dollars took away the 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.779
 bankers that is now these that money and much more than that of consequence 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.549
 logic inheritance we do not have to pay all Ecuadorians year and something else 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.919
 the history of the country if we call but on the contrary that in 1999 then 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.349
 efe 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.219
 p billions of funds from the depositors and that is until now 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.749
 more than a year the department a decade of research 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.169
 of some space sanction has not been able to recover that money there is a 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.029
 The sensation in the country is that corruption seemed to us and justly 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:02.209
 because one of the other one of the buccaneers plus two senses of the poblano public 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.519
 is to end corruption 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.769
 obviously speaking the political corruption of the big concession 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.669
 political and economic powers 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.559
 percent indicated claim 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.559
 with other directors 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:28.129
 light this case is one of the examples recalled the economic and strong power 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.349
 currents to political power 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.649
 The so-called bank robberies consisted in the theft of money from the 

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.960
 savers by a mafia belonging 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.460
 to private banking 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.349
 fact that it was covered and the benefit to holland 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.129
 and his environment of influences that he had in the government 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.969
 in his opinion the amount of factors that have been distorting the economy 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.360
 and how they charge that even constitutional reforms to ensure that the 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.749
 State delivered the money if it would disappear account resources 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.990
 concert performers of banking 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.479
 process only because the explanation 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.180
 that was deliberately organized 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.479
 peak planning of the bank robbery that meant to the country more than 8 thousand 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.279
 300 million dollars 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.759
 and those responsible 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.469
 Deheza managed from this plunder 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.819
 without you not answered where a single dollar voted because the parties 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.860
 politicians with programs costs 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.099
 and because in addition 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.519
 it turns out that the fists of the banks own the channels 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.650
 most parties that want to campaign because they need 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.060
 teresa espí without making messi I am not godfather the owners of the channels 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.519
 and of course when they already reach the national congress they at the same time reciprocal 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.779
 favors received by making more laws for for example financial groups 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.839
 and banking 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.349
 fernanda and that 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.919
 practically only took 800 million dollars with his bank the 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.379
 progress bank 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.559
 the slogan of abando progress progress in vain 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.669
 and what I'll try to heat up the biggest heist 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.830
 800 million dollars was operated two pieces 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.939

 the four thousand years 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:04.839
 I have finished 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.830
 in which the country was produced 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.669
 an environment of dissatisfaction 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.249
 widespread

 it was not all 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.550
 nothing less than a conciliatory

 does not consult brazenly with the American embassy 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.639
 the more corrupt the state 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.659
