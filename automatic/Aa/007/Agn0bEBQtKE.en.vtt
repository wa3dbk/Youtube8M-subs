perk<00:00:57.980> but<00:00:58.610> in<00:00:58.700> my<00:00:58.910> opinion<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.390> real<00:00:59.780> reason

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
perk but in my opinion the real reason

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.439 
perk but in my opinion the real reason
of<00:01:00.500> why<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.890> belongs<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> top<00:01:01.969> ten<00:01:02.270> is

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
of why it belongs in the top ten is

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.540 
of why it belongs in the top ten is
because<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.440> only<00:01:03.590> real<00:01:03.980> perk<00:01:04.309> worth

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
because it is the only real perk worth

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.760 
because it is the only real perk worth
using<00:01:04.879> in<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.509> tier<00:01:05.720> three<00:01:06.050> slot<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.560> black
