this<00:01:16.119> is<00:01:16.390> your<00:01:16.720> VGA<00:01:17.259> port<00:01:17.319> your<00:01:18.009> HDMI<00:01:18.700> which<00:01:18.940> is

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
this is your VGA port your HDMI which is

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.809 
this is your VGA port your HDMI which is
actually<00:01:19.240> backed<00:01:19.630> by<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.899> GMA<00:01:20.679> 4500<00:01:21.220> mhd

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
actually backed by the GMA 4500 mhd

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.089 
actually backed by the GMA 4500 mhd
chipset<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.990> will<00:01:23.080> do<00:01:23.200> 1080p<00:01:23.590> possible

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.099 
chipset so that will do 1080p possible

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.460 
chipset so that will do 1080p possible
to<00:01:24.160> channel<00:01:24.399> audio<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:25.509> have<00:01:25.539> two<00:01:25.660> USB<00:01:26.229> 2.0

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
to channel audio you have two USB 2.0

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.770 
to channel audio you have two USB 2.0
ports<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:28.030> then<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.209> have<00:01:28.300> your<00:01:28.330> input<00:01:28.509> and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
ports and then you have your input and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.699 
ports and then you have your input and
output<00:01:28.990> for<00:01:29.110> your<00:01:29.200> headset<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.560> your

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.810 
gorgeous display like I said it's 14
inch<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.110> 720p<00:02:55.920> native<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.489> we'll<00:02:56.670> do

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
inch but it is 720p native so we'll do

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.199

high-def<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.540> actually<00:02:57.810> 1366<00:02:58.709> x<00:02:59.370> 768<00:03:00.000> so

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
high-def it's actually 1366 x 768 so

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.990 
high-def it's actually 1366 x 768 so
it's<00:03:00.330> slightly<00:03:00.900> larger<00:03:01.350> than<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> 720p<00:03:02.130> display

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's slightly larger than a 720p display

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.080 
it's slightly larger than a 720p display
but<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.510> will<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> full<00:03:04.260> native<00:03:04.940> 720<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
but it will do a full native 720 and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.810 
but it will do a full native 720 and
it's<00:03:06.360> led<00:03:06.690> backed<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.070> if<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.580> don't<00:03:08.730> know

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820
