00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
more direct and they just put us under a
lot<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.470> pressure<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.700> know

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790

tried to play out on the weak side as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
tried to play out on the weak side as
well<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> stretch<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
well and really kind of stretch us so I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
well and really kind of stretch us so I
it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> gutty<00:01:13.320> performance<00:01:13.380> from

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it was it was a gutty performance from

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
it was it was a gutty performance from
them<00:01:13.979> tonight<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> thought<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.939> first<00:01:15.390> game

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
them tonight I thought the first game

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
them tonight I thought the first game
they<00:01:15.780> SAT<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.259> quite<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they SAT back quite a bit but they

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.560 
they SAT back quite a bit but they
pressed<00:01:17.430> us<00:01:17.610> more<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.420> why

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
pressed us more and I think that's why

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.969 
pressed us more and I think that's why
I'm<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.750> proud<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> our<00:01:19.259> defense<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.860> they

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I'm so proud of our defense because they

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
I'm so proud of our defense because they
pressed<00:01:20.250> us<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
pressed us more but we got out of the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.789 
pressed us more but we got out of the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
pressure and a big thing that we worked

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
pressure and a big thing that we worked
on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.400> last<00:01:23.580> few<00:01:23.729> days<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.030> making<00:01:24.270> sure

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
on the last few days was making sure

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.219 
on the last few days was making sure
that<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.600> were<00:01:24.659> getting<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> right

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that we were getting into the right

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
that we were getting into the right
positions<00:01:25.619> quickly<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.700> helping<00:01:26.939> out

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
positions quickly and really helping out

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
positions quickly and really helping out
each<00:01:27.450> other<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
each other and I think we did that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
each other and I think we did that
really<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:28.799> tonight<00:01:29.009> our<00:01:29.490> defense<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:30.540> on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
really well tonight our defense was on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
really well tonight our defense was on
top<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> their<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.710> mean<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:33.119> took

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
top of their game I mean I think we took

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
top of their game I mean I think we took
care<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> details<00:01:34.500> today<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> I

care of all of the details today and I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.200 
care of all of the details today and I
thought<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.520> entertaining<00:01:35.880> game<00:01:35.970> for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
thought it was an entertaining game for

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
thought it was an entertaining game for
the<00:01:36.270> crowd<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.810> crowd<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> unbelievable<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the crowd the crowd is unbelievable is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
the crowd the crowd is unbelievable is
wonderful<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> mean<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> huge<00:01:38.939> stadium<00:01:39.150> but

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
wonderful I mean it's a huge stadium but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
wonderful I mean it's a huge stadium but
the<00:01:39.780> atmosphere<00:01:40.110> felt<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:40.950> full<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the atmosphere felt very full and I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
the atmosphere felt very full and I
think<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> lot<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.540> good<00:01:42.659> parts

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
think there's a lot of really good parts

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
think there's a lot of really good parts
in<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.290> group<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
in this group and you know a lot of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
in this group and you know a lot of
experience<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.320> there's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
experience but also you know there's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.170 
experience but also you know there's
been<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.890> influx<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.460> youth<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.030> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
been an influx of youth and I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
been an influx of youth and I think
that's<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> help<00:01:48.630> us<00:01:48.810> over<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> course

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's going to help us over the course

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
that's going to help us over the course
of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> last<00:01:50.009> year<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> half<00:01:50.970> we've<00:01:51.270> kind

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
of the last year and a half we've kind

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
of the last year and a half we've kind
of<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:51.810> bringing<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:53.399> new

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of been bringing in some some new

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
of been bringing in some some new
players<00:01:53.759> Tom's<00:01:54.210> been<00:01:54.420> breeding<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:54.960> new

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
players Tom's been breeding some new

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
players Tom's been breeding some new
players<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> see

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
players and that's what we like to see

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
players and that's what we like to see
and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> we've<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> continue

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and I think that we've got to continue

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
and I think that we've got to continue
that<00:01:58.979> we've<00:01:59.280> also<00:01:59.430> got<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> continue<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that we've also got to continue with the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.440 
that we've also got to continue with the
veteran<00:02:00.750> mix<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:02.219> way<00:02:02.420> kind<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
veteran mix and just some way kind of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.440 
veteran mix and just some way kind of
come<00:02:03.630> together<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.290> figure<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> best

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
come together and figure out the best

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
come together and figure out the best
group<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.619> world<00:02:07.950> cup<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
group to go on to world cup and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
group to go on to world cup and
obviously<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> qualify<00:02:09.209> first<00:02:09.770> but

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
obviously we have to qualify first but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.600 
obviously we have to qualify first but
you<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.099> that's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you know that's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
you know that's
ultimate<00:02:11.910> goal<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> very<00:02:12.750> resilient<00:02:13.440> team

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
ultimate goal or a very resilient team

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180 
ultimate goal or a very resilient team
and<00:02:14.870> obviously<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.590> was<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> few<00:02:17.010> hard

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
