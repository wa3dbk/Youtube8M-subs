00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello, I used to go and today I 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 part 2 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 You can partially dress I will speak. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:01:04.010
 it was exactly such a notebook 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:10.220

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.220
 further such notebook they are all in the cell 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 series of matches on 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.810
 what is the strength here like this 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 and in the back something really the same cucumber is 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.940
 to tell 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.940
 this and know it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830
 python 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.970
 why do we have such scraps tell on 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 then I took as I am so good 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.700
 Monsters University I took one line 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.700
 only engine is higher 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.150
 further and a series of angry birds 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 yes you know I slipped after school today 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 further and the cod series is the very first notebook 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.120
 such a little black 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.130
 they cost all these boxes 3 to 30 rubles 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.180
 40 more Here's a sinenkaja 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:42.650
 and lay out so 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:45.849
 And this already 30 and still have us just another 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.849
 too now 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 Further probably a series here from nothing 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:01.640
 signed and server bear cubs such 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:06.760
 bear carefully lang syne 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.450

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.049
 from some very sexy some story 8 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.500

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.189
 these are green for us together 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.049
 clear it is wrapping the lines that 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.049
 it ends with a strong sense 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.080
 down the rifles in Russian 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:47.300
 everything is just like this should give it 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.110
 death was a little away from the series necessary 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.400
 also 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.700

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.130

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.190
 try spare notebook Engry Beards 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.490

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.040
 the subject 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.240
 wall 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.240
 in indian 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.050
 I ended up with a pan disc offset estimates 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.560
 I'm already acting over 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.230
 if you need this video hello one more 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.920
 that is, the diary itself is far away 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.190
 the most important thing for me is always 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.450
 But if anyone has a problem here who is me 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.450

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.720
 for now just get stuck on the diary differences 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.980

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:12.030
