comfortable living in the space so I

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.130

want to do any pattern all of the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.330 
want to do any pattern all of the
fabrics<00:01:14.800> are<00:01:15.070> solids<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.320> they're<00:01:17.320> also<00:01:17.560> kind

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
fabrics are solids and they're also kind

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.520 
fabrics are solids and they're also kind
of<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.670> color<00:01:18.940> blocking<00:01:19.450> method<00:01:19.840> where<00:01:20.200> you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
of in a color blocking method where you

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.680 
of in a color blocking method where you
have<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.920> floor<00:01:21.250> being<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.729> neutral<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.479> walls

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
have the floor being a neutral the walls

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.539 
have the floor being a neutral the walls
being<00:01:23.080> one<00:01:23.320> color<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.920> ceiling<00:01:24.340> being

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
being one color the ceiling being

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.630 
being one color the ceiling being
another<00:01:24.880> color<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:26.470> everything<00:01:27.130> is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
another color and so everything is

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.880 
another color and so everything is
blended<00:01:28.060> although<00:01:28.600> it's<00:01:28.750> very<00:01:29.049> strong<00:01:29.500> color

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.609 
blended although it's very strong color
nothing<00:01:30.880> particularly<00:01:31.299> pops<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:32.110> at<00:01:32.380> you

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
nothing particularly pops out at you

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.920 
nothing particularly pops out at you
because<00:01:32.799> it's<00:01:33.219> all<00:01:33.369> strong<00:01:33.810> everything<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
because it's all strong everything is

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.980 
because it's all strong everything is
movable<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.590> that's<00:01:36.369> really<00:01:37.149> key<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> small

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
movable and that's really key to a small

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.590 
movable and that's really key to a small

in this small space that's very

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.020 
in this small space that's very

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this space really is my living area

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810 
this space really is my living area
where<00:01:51.659> people<00:01:51.810> come<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.350> sit<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.670> can

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
where people come in sit down we can

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.179 
where people come in sit down we can
talk<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> defined<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> back

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
talk and then I kind of defined the back

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.270 
talk and then I kind of defined the back
space<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.909> what<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.570> office<00:01:57.990> area<00:01:58.530> but

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
space as what is my office area but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.459 
space as what is my office area but
again<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.210> everything<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.750> movable<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
again because everything is movable I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.910 
again because everything is movable I
could<00:02:01.890> create<00:02:02.250> many<00:02:02.640> different<00:02:02.729> spaces<00:02:03.920> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
could create many different spaces the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.889 
could create many different spaces the
island<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> bookcase<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.479> kept

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
island was a bookcase and I kept

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
island was a bookcase and I kept
thinking<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.250> working<00:02:08.729> surface

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
thinking how can I get a working surface

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.290 
thinking how can I get a working surface
in<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.390> kitchen<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.920> moved<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> island<00:02:11.580> just

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
in my kitchen so I moved the island just

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300 
in my kitchen so I moved the island just
to<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> edge<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.590> painted<00:02:13.890> wood<00:02:14.040> floor

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to the edge of the painted wood floor
