00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the seed stitch is an easy stitch to do

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.100 
the seed stitch is an easy stitch to do
it's<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.460> simple<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.420> also<00:00:24.750> something

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
it's very simple and it's also something

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.080 
it's very simple and it's also something
you'll<00:00:25.380> use<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.130> your<00:00:26.610> projects

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
you'll use a lot in your projects

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
you'll use a lot in your projects
because<00:00:27.360> it<00:00:27.390> lays<00:00:27.689> completely<00:00:28.230> flat<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.160> it's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
because it lays completely flat so it's

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.510 
because it lays completely flat so it's
great<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.090> boarder<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.160> any<00:00:32.160> sort<00:00:32.489> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
great for a boarder or any sort of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430 
great for a boarder or any sort of
design<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.970> you're<00:00:33.090> doing<00:00:33.329> here's<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.050> seed

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
design that you're doing here's the seed

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.069 
design that you're doing here's the seed
stitch<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.180> all-time<00:00:36.510> favorite

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
stitch it's one of my all-time favorite

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590 
stitch it's one of my all-time favorite
stitches<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:38.220> because<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> lays<00:00:38.910> flat<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stitches just because it lays flat and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
stitches just because it lays flat and
it's<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:40.170> awesome<00:00:40.410> texture<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.730> called<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it's an awesome texture it's called the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's an awesome texture it's called the
seed<00:00:42.360> stitch<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:44.190> guess<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.700> looks

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
seed stitch because it I guess it looks

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.680 
seed stitch because it I guess it looks
like<00:00:45.180> seeds<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:47.100> ground<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:48.329> really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
like seeds on the ground I don't really

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
like seeds on the ground I don't really
see<00:00:48.929> it<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.129> name<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.519> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
see it but that's the name of it and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.689 
see it but that's the name of it and
it's<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.149> reversible<00:00:51.749> so<00:00:52.379> each<00:00:52.949> side<00:00:53.339> looks

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's also reversible so each side looks

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.770 
it's also reversible so each side looks
the<00:00:53.879> exact<00:00:54.210> same

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the exact same

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
the exact same
the<00:00:54.960> seed<00:00:55.260> stitch<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.980> made<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.269> combination

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the seed stitch is made by a combination

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410 
the seed stitch is made by a combination
of<00:00:58.379> knit<00:00:58.679> stitches<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.370> purl<00:00:59.699> stitches<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of knit stitches and purl stitches you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
of knit stitches and purl stitches you
basically<00:01:00.839> do<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.489> knit<00:01:02.820> purl<00:01:03.030> knit<00:01:03.179> purl

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
basically do you go knit purl knit purl

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
basically do you go knit purl knit purl
knit<00:01:03.629> purl<00:01:03.929> knit<00:01:04.080> purl<00:01:04.230> for<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> whole<00:01:04.860> row<00:01:05.070> but

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
knit purl knit purl for a whole row but

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.420 
knit purl knit purl for a whole row but
instead<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.950> knitting<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> knits<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
instead of knitting the knits and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
instead of knitting the knits and
purling<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> pearls<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> opposite

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
purling the pearls you do the opposite

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300 
purling the pearls you do the opposite
so<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.360> knit<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> pearls<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.800> purl<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so you knit the pearls and you purl the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.730 
so you knit the pearls and you purl the
knits<00:01:14.550> and<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> does<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.260> it<00:01:16.440> helps

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
knits and what that does is it helps

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.610 
knits and what that does is it helps
create<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.490> rigid<00:01:18.110> bumpy<00:01:19.110> texture

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
create this kind of rigid bumpy texture

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.370 
create this kind of rigid bumpy texture

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
pretty easy to finish up the row so

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.270 
pretty easy to finish up the row so
you're<00:02:59.270> just<00:02:59.360> gonna<00:02:59.510> do<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.959> for<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.100> whole

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
you're just gonna do that for this whole

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.949 
you're just gonna do that for this whole
row<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:01.910> we'll<00:03:02.060> flip<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.360> over<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.840> do

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
the same thing flipping it over I'm

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.620 
the same thing flipping it over I'm
gonna<00:03:10.100> keep<00:03:10.370> growing<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.880> out<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> little

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
gonna keep growing this out a little

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.860 
gonna keep growing this out a little
more<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.400> we<00:03:13.520> can<00:03:13.670> see<00:03:14.000> kind<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.570> what's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
more just so we can see kind of what's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.979 
more just so we can see kind of what's
happening<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.650> little<00:03:16.160> clearer<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> last

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
happening a little clearer so the last

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.870 
happening a little clearer so the last
stitch<00:03:18.290> was<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.560> purl<00:03:18.860> I'm<00:03:19.130> gonna<00:03:19.280> knit<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.670> now

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
stitch was a purl I'm gonna knit it now

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.000 
stitch was a purl I'm gonna knit it now
and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:20.810> purl<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.380> one<00:03:22.450> knit<00:03:24.040> purl<00:03:25.040> knit

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and then purl this one knit purl knit

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.340 
and then purl this one knit purl knit
and<00:03:28.010> throw<00:03:28.610> I'm<00:03:29.300> gonna<00:03:29.510> do<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.630> couple<00:03:29.989> more

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
and throw I'm gonna do a couple more

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.860 
and throw I'm gonna do a couple more
rows<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.980> then<00:03:31.160> I'll<00:03:31.280> show<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.580> what<00:03:31.870> it

rows and then I'll show you what it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.670 
rows and then I'll show you what it
looks<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:34.209> here<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.300> is<00:03:35.420> after<00:03:35.660> doing<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
looks like here it is after doing I

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860 
looks like here it is after doing I
think<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.310> did<00:03:37.489> three<00:03:37.850> or<00:03:37.880> four<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.360> rows<00:03:38.570> here

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
think I did three or four more rows here

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.990 
think I did three or four more rows here
and<00:03:39.739> now<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.070> really<00:03:40.220> see<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.670> seed

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
and now you can really see the seed

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.540 
and now you can really see the seed
pattern<00:03:41.510> starting<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.620> form<00:03:42.920> here<00:03:43.010> we've<00:03:43.430> got

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
pattern starting to form here we've got

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.220 
pattern starting to form here we've got
all<00:03:43.820> these<00:03:44.000> little<00:03:44.180> pearls<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.810> are<00:03:44.870> really

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
all these little pearls that are really

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.740 
all these little pearls that are really
popping<00:03:45.440> out<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.010> then<00:03:46.610> on<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.239> flip<00:03:47.450> side<00:03:47.480> we

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
popping out and then on the flip side we

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.360 
popping out and then on the flip side we
have<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.959> same<00:03:48.140> thing<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:49.130> makes<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.340> really

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
have the same thing just makes a really

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.060 
have the same thing just makes a really
nice<00:03:49.760> texture<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.630> eventually<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.590> will<00:03:51.680> look

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
nice texture and eventually it will look

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.880 
nice texture and eventually it will look
like<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.360> keep<00:03:53.480> growing

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
like this one it will just keep growing

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.009 
like this one it will just keep growing
into<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.010> nice<00:03:55.250> little<00:03:55.430> pattern<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.720> is

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
into this nice little pattern that is

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.900 
into this nice little pattern that is
the<00:03:57.260> seed<00:03:57.500> stitch<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:57.980> pretty<00:03:58.310> easy<00:03:58.550> once

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
the seed stitch it's pretty easy once

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.820 
the seed stitch it's pretty easy once
you<00:03:59.090> get<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.660> hang<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.800> a

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
you get the hang of it it can be a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.820 
you get the hang of it it can be a
little<00:04:01.220> difficult

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
little difficult

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.470 
little difficult

just knowing which ones to knit and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.690 
just knowing which ones to knit and
which<00:04:05.660> ones<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.050> purl<00:04:06.320> but<00:04:07.070> as<00:04:07.280> long<00:04:07.489> as<00:04:07.519> you
