00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.790
 Big question 1 is the US and China 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.630
 Let's go all over Buddha 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.729
 I'm making a book 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.819
 But 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.449
 District court decision 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.059
 But I join 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.009
 20-seat trial for use 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.119
 Yes I thought it was Camry, but my name joined 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599
 I think it comes against the blue sky 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.859
 Once 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.930
 President Adachi will withdraw 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.259
 This time middle and high happened 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.779
 Have these 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.630
 It is premised that it is squeezing that I will chase in Yone Kuridong 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.629
 I use the function because I put this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.450
 To the person who bulied with Henin 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.790
 please look 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.230
 issa uniform 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.390
 Make an omelet using ie7 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.720
 I'm spreading this out-I think there is a trick 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.250
 Increase edit width 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.100
 I say today 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 Guts pose hit no score 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930
 It stands in various places 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.790
 It wakes up 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.720
 It has been said that the same number so far 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.540
 It is Graham site 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.060
 One from that 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 After that Aichi 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 The fact that the race has been stepped though 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.420
 2 cities in the same city 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600
 Above 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.570
 If only you 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.040
 But it is that 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.660
 That's difficult 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.270
 What to do with it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 It is a property, but I think it was dropped 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.460
 Not lose 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.360
 Yeah 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810
 I was behind 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.280
 Rice field head 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.190
 Here 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 There is also this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060
 This 12 people 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.520
 However as content 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.990
 If anyone could put on during open negotiations 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.250
 There was Kintetsu 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.440
 That's easy to do, but Ichiro 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.240
 Here is dangerous 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.260
 I will go this way because it is the best 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.320
 Even if there were many same people and poured 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.540
 I have a lake shop 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 It was true that there was a temperature 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 Just that 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.859
 If rice is eaten again 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.089
 I have an idea 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.020
 Head 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.079
 from now on 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.309
 Not only that 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 I'm repeating pool work 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.439
 Fortunately it is a statement, but it returns at this time 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 When you resume, in the form of facing you 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.079
 You can have it in the form of an omelet 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.079
 It was a form to some extent 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.109
 It is also here 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.829
 You can also pour it in, so so-netblog is 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.559
 * 3 will be done because we actually put cigarettes 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 I will start to run 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.559
 On the other hand 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.559
 The wide is 814 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.169
 It releases this time 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:00.950
 With that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.289
 Only once 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.279
 Kimura Yuho 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.219
 Improve efficiency 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.219
 I am in the play 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.629
 It is with an apagado 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.629
 That's why there are not many respondents 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.529
大 け ま ち ま ち

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.699
 Nagaoka 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.479
 Not hit 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.479
 Akira Saito, President of Mitsunobu Fujiguchi 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.909
 I have used it 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.169
 I want to build more firmly 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.789
 I can do it only this week 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.789
 The week was over 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 As we bring back Aegis in-ship facility 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.839
 Last month 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.460
 Kokura of the previous run 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.460
 It feels like home 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.309
 Because it fell with the personal computer 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.270
 I generally like this 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 The old people who dropped by this participate 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.229
 Old pride away 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 Still here 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.479
 Put it in a mature state 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.039
 This is behind 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.039
 The rice here is very basic but rushed 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.580
 Hard to make at home from a soft person is difficult 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.020
 It is easy to wind hard 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.080
 Takoyaki people 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.999
 The rate of decline is large 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.229
 Why at first please solidify and practice 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.229
 this time 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.490
 Please do it again for a long time here 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.009
 I'm putting fire 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.009
 I'm back again 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.150
 After all I said this 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.349
 Node this is life 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.629
 It's an omelet 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.629
 Fine fine 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.430
 Next is it 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.710
 The draft is also based on 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
 Not too expensive 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.659
 confession if it is n. q 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.580
 Come here from here 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.580
 Body of mind 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.550
 It's supposed to be here not like this 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:37.249
 Is 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.189
 Below is a list of country-specific forms 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.869
 Saying especially 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.869
 Even if there is air, it topics 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.629
 Never show off 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.369
 It will be completed again, but 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.819
 It has stagnated but in recent years 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:20.960
 Another example in the US 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.139
 The US is fast 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.139
 The same town Kawashima 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.249
 I'm muddy 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.249
 Barrel of Saipan 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.490
 Holding here 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.610
 That kind of thing 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.460
 If you have any questions 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.460
 It has spread 

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:58.909
 The story is gradually different from the eyes 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:01.909
 Follow me properly 

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.749
 I got a row of consolidation 

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:13.139
 How about that 

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.460
 IT companies can 

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.170
 By all means once
