00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.470
 this recipe is called the bella napoli 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.480
 one of my usual brother-in-law told me 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.339
 with ingredients therefore it takes two 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.039
 chili peppers as you see I have them 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:31.300
 already prepared then it takes duets of 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.660
 a tuna of anchovies then I am a tuna 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.210
 sugar spoon then a bottle 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.609
 of rubra that we will empty and then serve 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.680
 I 'll get you some oil and vinegar now 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:45.910
 of the procedure practically you 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:52.480
 pour the gravediggers short but there then yes 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:01:00.190
 pay the rubric of a business 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:04.540
 with moon bottles per eye then 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:12.070
 empty the rubra bottle and then yes 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:18.460
 puts inside bottle of 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.990
 vinegar you control more or less where 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.990
 there is the blackest label 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.490
 this always rightly my wine 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.320
 I put them even a little less because the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:38.799
 my ok strong conscience of a goal 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 bottle of vinegar and it shows already if it 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:52.469
 so I put the version enough 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 vinegar and then pour in half 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.759
 oil bottle is not item will be 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.829
 of course the bottle of della rubra 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.829
 and pour this in too 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:20.340
 then put a spoonful of sugar 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.550
 this one I put away all 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.530
 apple years i will be back this winter and the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.790
 mantia both as an appetizer and as a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.730
 outline depends on how you want it that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:40.800
 burn rightly pour yours 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:45.480
 tuna pour your anchovies and yes 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.200
 will put on the fire to cook for about 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 three minutes from when to calculate three 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.060
 minutes from when it begins to boil and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.930
 I'll see you 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.320
 naturally after that they will be all that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 will be boiled and we are found in the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.910
 angela kitchen as you see I already have 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.390
 Cook everything and I've already put it 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.180
 in the jars you need to vasarely to hot 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.830
 put everything warm and then put it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.790
 inside a party the bain-marie 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.310
 with hot water and release 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.070
 practically since they want five 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.570
 minutes calculated five minutes but 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.120
 past five minutes 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.330
 you must then remove them from the boiling water 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.810
 and let them cool or south endive 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.460
 on marble on something and chickens you will withdraw 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 when it's cold, though 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.260
 remember that you have to leave them only 5 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.770
 minutes and remove it with water like 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 I see the raw files all here 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.680
 and then instrumental for 5 minutes
