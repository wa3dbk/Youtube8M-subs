00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello how about times in today's video 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.930
 let's make a necklace that is very very 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.320
 very in trend is combining threads 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.590
 chains and ball look at what prettier thing 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.970
 is a pass it becomes very easy so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.970
 are that you like video 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 materials are going to be a piece of string 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.759
 about 45 centimeters approximately 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.829
 different colors of threads I use 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.890
 cross stitch and crochet balls 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.640
 these are the ones that imitate the fimo are 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.660
 each one different we will need 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.840
 the pliers the scissors a needle 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.910
 pincers canes washer a close 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.410
 carabiner and also you have to look for 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.340
 something like a tray or a lid of a 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 shoe box worth 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.629
 Well let's take our thread and let's go 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.920
 To make three groups each group will have 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.350
 all the thread colors that we are going to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 use let's say a little here 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 and when we have a few 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.100
 turns then we change to another group 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 now we will make the third 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.060
 we already cut 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.830
 and we started doing the same with a thread 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.610
 different and this we will do with all 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 the thread colors 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 now that we have a thickness 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.150
 enough, what we are going to do is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.150
 tie it here 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.910
 and once tied, we cut them 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.350
 we will hold the three ends here together 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.599
 to then form a braid 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.330
 we hold the end to the edge of the lid 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.330
 with the clamp 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.610
 and let's start making a braid 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.480
 normal and current without squeezing it 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.480
 it too 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.230
 and when we get to the tip then 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.230
 we put it back here with a trickle 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 and what we have left so we cut it 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.870
 the braid has two faces 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.250
 and choose the one you like the most, I think 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.400
 I'm going to choose this one that are the colors 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.620
 now more distributed l Bramos a needle 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.890
 is a fairly long piece of string and the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 double and we are going to sew the chain to the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.560
 braid we leave here a piece of string 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.989
 and we are going to start sewing 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.159
 we passed twice always 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.609
 by the same link 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.690
 taking care that we are not given the 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.690
 return 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.690
 taking a piece of yarn 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.010
 going through the link 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.140
 and we went back a second time 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.660
 and we will continue doing this for all 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.660
 chain 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.260
 and this will stay like this 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.110
 now we're going to go to the canes 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.260
 putting a ball 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.310
 we cut a little bit the rest 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.310
 and we are going to do 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.100
 a pot 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.790
 until we have about 13 or 14 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.340
 grams at her age the pretty to the braid 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.880
 of thread through the part open in the part 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.370
 of the braid you take a little thread and 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.570
 close behind 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.570
 here is here 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.889
 yes wright 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.659
 and now we are repeating this 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.830
 interspersing balls of different 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:45.639
 colors and you already know always closing by 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.639
 the part behind 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.919
 and I'm going to leave it like this in the end I've 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.389
 put 11 balls and now what I'm going to 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.389
 do is put your closure 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.110
 and ready 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.490
 whose asset ended 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.490
 you see that modern 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.890
 and these last trend and also os 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.180
 I'm going to teach another one that I've done already 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.460
 you know I do the little things in 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.890
 two one for me another for my sister not 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.210
 I know which one I'll keep I'll give to her 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.410
 to choose and good one thing that I wanted 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.750
 comment many of you I 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.160
 you ask what kind of earrings usually 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.810
 use when I wear these necklaces like this 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.570
 so big because I like to wear 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.610
 the little ones and shorties or from this 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.300
 kind of these pegaditos to the ear that 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.370
 it would suit you in the colors or 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.320
 I usually do if I have the possibility or if 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.110
 I have left a little ball because of this type 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.400
 of these so hanging with the hook 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.100
 yep and this for example would be for this one 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.980
 in lilac tones 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.980
 and this in blue because they would be for this 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.520
 well then that's how it is put and I think that 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.840
