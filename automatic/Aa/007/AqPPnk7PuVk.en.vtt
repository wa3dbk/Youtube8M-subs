00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 this acer aspire v3 371 5806 it is one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
 13.3 inch laptop with a biogas oil 5 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.650
 processor 6 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.090
 why makes it extremely suitable for 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 photo and hobby editing 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 watch videos of all kinds 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.770
 multimedia on full hd we play 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.000
 simple games but of course also 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.710
 the daily serve kind by one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.910
 cool internet and it all 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 on the way 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.609
 first look at material sour 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.529
 that you have the top skill of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.500
 a dark gray plastic and there is one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 kind of crow's feet motivations use 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.810
 unique from actually 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.430
 gives a nice sleek chic 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.540
 appearance and at the bottom we see 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.710
 that he is frost of a moth species 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.840
 material and also we see the battery 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 is not replaceable 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 he is how comma seven and focused 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 centimeters thick and a few 49 kilos 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 remember that in combination with being 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 13.3 inch format of course 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 extremely compact and also very bad 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.110
 is suitable for use on the road 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 and so of course to put effort into each 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 kind of pass i will be very near the screen 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.399
 an a4 would like you to get an idea of it 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 how big it is and I love it 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 behind it and spare the screen 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 probably not musky anymore 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
 put it on the corner to see it for a moment 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.769
 wide is just slightly less high though 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 in combination with that full hd resolution 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.790
 So have enough space to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.869
 work it is a matte screen and that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.030
 it means it still bothered for a long time 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.439
 has reflections but a little less 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 full bright color then produce one 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.549
 glossy screen and next to it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.750
 top of the screen after d-day 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.030
 webcam because then I very often not before 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.320
 now look the keyboard them too 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.180
 has no numbering part but that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 not yet a very open app of this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 format from a beautiful design 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 expected touchpad may not be from 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.659
 of course there was already a people mouse there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.009
 to connect 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.060
 he's got blood or four and that 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 means your device for you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.490
 smartphone knows that also have fines 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.320
 can connect wirelessly to the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.729
 laptop might not have you can 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.409
 well the cards are just in it 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 nice to put in the laptop there too 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 a cardreader and he is such an hdmi 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 gate and that thing is possibly extra 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.460
 monitor can connect or there can 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 connect to the tv and has card usb 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.729
 connections once deep and one 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 times 2 point 0 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 internally we find in the laptop and 128 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 gigabyte ssd that I think that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 they start super fast and so do you 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.640
 programs will load much faster and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.079
 then he has graphic computing power 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 shared video card and that means that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.530
 he becomes for the simple games of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 angry birds i know i'm fine enough 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.420
 is 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.099
 but not for the graphically heavier ones 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 such as 3004 or call 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.610
 of duty you would like to know more about it 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.129
 or want to purchase from you 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.849
 do we join laptopshop.nl on their own or 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.849
 fire in one of our stores
