to prepare for the next fold alright so
you<00:01:17.340> flipped<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.790> paper<00:01:18.090> over<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> now

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you flipped your paper over and now

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.149 
you flipped your paper over and now
you're<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> take<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
you're just going to take this and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
you're just going to take this and
reverse<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.490> whole<00:01:23.820> piece<00:01:24.259> over<00:01:25.259> there's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
reverse this whole piece over there's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
reverse this whole piece over there's
there's<00:01:25.950> already<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.549> line<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:28.080> from

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
there's already a line right here from

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
there's already a line right here from
the<00:01:28.890> last<00:01:29.130> folds<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> did<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.840> you're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the last folds that you did so you're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
the last folds that you did so you're
folding<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.689> across<00:01:33.689> along<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.770> line<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
folding it across along that line and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
folding it across along that line and
just<00:01:35.610> sort<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> reversing<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.290> flat<00:01:37.710> from

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just sort of reversing this flat from

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
just sort of reversing this flat from
one<00:01:38.400> side<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.150> other<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.240> if

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
one side to the other like that so if

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
one side to the other like that so if
when<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> flipped<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.549> was

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
when you flipped it around it was

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
when you flipped it around it was
looking<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
looking like this then you're going to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.840 
looking like this then you're going to
just<00:01:47.189> take<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.850> piece<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> flip<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.350> over

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
just take the piece and flip it over

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
just take the piece and flip it over
reverse<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> looks<00:01:52.649> like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
reverse it around so now it looks like

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.219 
reverse it around so now it looks like
this<00:01:53.659> then<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.350> piece<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.299> fold<00:01:57.299> down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this then take this piece and fold down

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.660 
this then take this piece and fold down
and<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:58.920> folding<00:02:00.860> your<00:02:01.860> folding<00:02:02.369> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and you're folding your folding this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.980 
and you're folding your folding this
edge<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.500> lines<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.149> with<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.659> line

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
edge so that it lines up with this line

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.029 
edge so that it lines up with this line
here<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.580> edge<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.599> coming<00:02:10.140> down

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
here so this edge here is coming down

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
here so this edge here is coming down
and<00:02:11.430> across

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and across

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.670 
and across
this<00:02:12.900> edge<00:02:13.459> down<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.990> now

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this edge down up down and over and now

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.380 
this edge down up down and over and now
it's<00:02:16.920> lined<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.550> along<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:23.390> now

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
it's lined up along here like so now

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.780 
it's lined up along here like so now
make<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.380> good<00:02:25.410> crease<00:02:25.950> along<00:02:26.490> that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
make a really good crease along that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.650 
make a really good crease along that
fold<00:02:27.530> open<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:30.330> put<00:02:30.360> your

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
fold open it up and then put your

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.590 
fold open it up and then put your
fingers<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.130> sort<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> pull<00:02:33.300> this

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
fingers in here and sort of pull this

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.150 
fingers in here and sort of pull this
whole<00:02:33.959> piece<00:02:34.500> across<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.440> like

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
whole piece across so that you see like

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.990 
whole piece across so that you see like
this<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.480> inside<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.770> fold<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
this on the inside and then fold this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.259 
this on the inside and then fold this
down<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.020> you're<00:02:43.170> reversing<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:44.790> crease

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
down and you're reversing that crease

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.820 
down and you're reversing that crease
that<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.750> made<00:02:46.050> now<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.590> sort<00:02:46.769> of

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that you just made now it's sort of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 
that you just made now it's sort of
reversed<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> other<00:02:47.700> direction<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
reversed in the other direction on the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.570 
reversed in the other direction on the
one<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.290> side<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.280> when<00:02:50.430> you're

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
one on that side so that when you're

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.990 
one on that side so that when you're
done<00:02:51.350> you'll<00:02:52.350> have<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> piece<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.459> looks<00:02:53.670> like

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
done you'll have a piece that looks like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.229 
done you'll have a piece that looks like
this<00:02:55.850> now<00:02:56.850> you're<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.900> take<00:02:58.280> these<00:02:59.280> two

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this now you're going to take these two

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.990 
this now you're going to take these two
flaps<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.709> you're<00:03:02.100> going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> fold<00:03:02.610> them

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
flaps here and you're going to fold them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.710 
flaps here and you're going to fold them
in<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:04.380> folding<00:03:05.040> along<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.060> line<00:03:06.420> here

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
in your folding along this line here

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.930 
in your folding along this line here
you're<00:03:06.900> folding<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.680> half<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.819> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you're folding this in half so if you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.210 
you're folding this in half so if you
bring<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.450> piece<00:03:09.810> over<00:03:12.350> your<00:03:13.350> folding<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.100> in

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
bring this piece over your folding it in

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460 
bring this piece over your folding it in
half<00:03:14.250> here<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.630> lining<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.230> with<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
half here and just lining up with the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.300 
half here and just lining up with the
center<00:03:17.070> line<00:03:17.310> create<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> crease<00:03:19.040> open<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> back

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
center line create a crease open it back

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.539 
center line create a crease open it back
up<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> same<00:03:21.570> thing<00:03:21.810> with<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.140> flap

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549

bring<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.120> over<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.150> you're

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
bring it up and over so that you're

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.580 
bring it up and over so that you're
folding<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.370> basically<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.640> half<00:03:30.560> create<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
folding this basically in half create a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.770 
folding this basically in half create a
crease<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:35.510> open<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.630> back<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:38.390> then<00:03:39.390> once

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
crease and open it back up then once

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.800 
crease and open it back up then once
you've<00:03:39.989> made<00:03:40.260> those<00:03:40.590> creases<00:03:41.390> lift<00:03:42.390> this

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
you've made those creases lift this

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.479 
you've made those creases lift this
piece<00:03:43.260> here<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.540> allow<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.040> bend<00:03:47.040> right

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
piece here and allow it to bend right

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.060 
piece here and allow it to bend right
across<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.510> straight<00:03:48.989> across<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:49.859> so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
across like straight across here so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.810 
across like straight across here so
you're<00:03:50.250> allowing<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.299> bend<00:03:51.660> there<00:03:52.230> and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
you're allowing it to bend there and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.479 
you're allowing it to bend there and
then<00:03:53.820> pushing<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.049> sides<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:56.250> going

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
then pushing it on the sides it's going

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.640 
then pushing it on the sides it's going
to<00:03:56.549> bend<00:03:56.910> now<00:03:57.359> you're<00:03:57.540> reversing<00:03:57.900> along<00:03:58.440> that

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
to bend now you're reversing along that

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.310 
to bend now you're reversing along that
line<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.489> made<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.150> straight<00:04:01.109> up

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
line that you just made and straight up

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.000 
line that you just made and straight up
and<00:04:01.530> down<00:04:01.590> over<00:04:02.100> here<00:04:02.750> same<00:04:03.750> thing<00:04:04.019> here<00:04:04.350> push

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
and down over here same thing here push

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.310 
and down over here same thing here push
it<00:04:05.190> on<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> side<00:04:05.609> so<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> bends<00:04:06.329> along<00:04:06.780> here

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
it on the side so it bends along here

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.900 
it on the side so it bends along here
and<00:04:07.790> straight<00:04:08.790> along<00:04:09.299> there<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:11.489> then<00:04:11.730> when

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
and straight along there so then when

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:21.240 
and straight along there so then when
you're<00:04:12.030> done<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.980> will<00:04:14.430> be<00:04:14.579> shaped<00:04:14.880> like<00:04:15.180> this

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.040 

now<00:04:22.250> next<00:04:22.610> you're<00:04:22.910> going<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.090> fold<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.600> piece

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
now next you're going to fold this piece

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.520 
now next you're going to fold this piece
this<00:04:24.680> top<00:04:24.919> part<00:04:25.190> back<00:04:25.669> down<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:27.169> you're<00:04:27.349> back

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
this top part back down so you're back

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.809 
this top part back down so you're back
exposing<00:04:28.099> that<00:04:28.370> little<00:04:28.849> triangular<00:04:30.819> point

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
exposing that little triangular point

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.059 
exposing that little triangular point
and<00:04:32.229> then<00:04:33.229> flip<00:04:33.560> your<00:04:33.770> piece<00:04:34.009> around<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:36.069> on

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
and then flip your piece around and on

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.740 
and then flip your piece around and on
these<00:04:37.250> bottom<00:04:38.530> flaps<00:04:39.530> here<00:04:40.069> fold<00:04:40.699> this<00:04:41.270> point

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
these bottom flaps here fold this point

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.930 
these bottom flaps here fold this point
over<00:04:42.349> to<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.949> center<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:44.199> each<00:04:45.199> side<00:04:45.699> so<00:04:46.699> this

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
over to the center on each side so this

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:56.170 
over to the center on each side so this
point<00:04:47.650> over<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.070> center<00:04:50.860> like<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:55.180> all

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
point over to the center like so all

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.779 
point over to the center like so all
