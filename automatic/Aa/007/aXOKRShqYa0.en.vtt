but<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.290> it's<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.559> doing<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
but what it's actually doing is

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.770 
but what it's actually doing is
processing<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.940> video<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.540> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
processing the video that was just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
processing the video that was just
recorded<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> applying<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.580> redaction<00:00:54.150> filter

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
recorded and applying a redaction filter

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.390 
recorded and applying a redaction filter
where<00:00:55.650> my<00:00:55.860> finger<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.440> protect<00:00:58.890> Nathan's

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
where my finger was to protect Nathan's

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.270 
where my finger was to protect Nathan's
privacy<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.720> it's<00:01:00.840> using<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.350> native

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.330 

open<00:01:05.280> source<00:01:05.489> project<00:01:06.979> redaction

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.300 

and<00:01:10.880> then<00:01:11.030> as<00:01:11.180> soon<00:01:11.360> as<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:11.689> done<00:01:12.310> it'll

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and then as soon as it's done it'll

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.100 
and then as soon as it's done it'll
actually<00:01:13.520> play<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.060> video<00:01:14.299> back<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:14.930> can

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
actually play the video back so we can

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.170 
actually play the video back so we can
see<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:17.530> black<00:01:18.530> box<00:01:18.890> following<00:01:19.579> Nathan's<00:01:19.939> face

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
see a black box following Nathan's face

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.520 
see a black box following Nathan's face
around<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:23.210> will<00:01:23.329> actually<00:01:23.659> happen<00:01:23.810> very<00:01:24.140> soon

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
around it will actually happen very soon

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.300 
around it will actually happen very soon
so<00:01:25.009> keep<00:01:25.490> your<00:01:25.670> eye<00:01:25.729> on<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.210> oh<00:01:27.039> there<00:01:28.039> it<00:01:28.159> is

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
so keep your eye on you oh there it is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.810 
so keep your eye on you oh there it is
so<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:29.179> finger<00:01:29.509> wasn't<00:01:29.750> exactly<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.820> loops

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
so my finger wasn't exactly in the loops

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:42.060 
so my finger wasn't exactly in the loops
so<00:01:32.439> I'll<00:01:33.439> pull<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.649> up

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.120 

so<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.730> year<00:01:42.940> ago<00:01:43.000> Toby<00:01:43.540> see<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.960> video<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.950> we

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
so a year ago Toby see the video that we

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.590 
so a year ago Toby see the video that we
showed<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.730> idea<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.060> Facebook<00:01:46.450> my

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
showed just the idea to Facebook my

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.780 
showed just the idea to Facebook my
shaking<00:01:46.960> work<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:47.890> face<00:01:48.070> detection<00:01:48.280> with

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
shaking work this is face detection with

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.880 
shaking work this is face detection with
video<00:01:49.090> processing<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.110> output<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:50.830> be

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
video processing and the output can be

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.670 
video processing and the output can be
uploaded<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.520> youtube<00:01:51.880> or<00:01:52.120> any<00:01:52.690> other<00:01:52.780> hosting

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
uploaded to youtube or any other hosting

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.200 
uploaded to youtube or any other hosting
