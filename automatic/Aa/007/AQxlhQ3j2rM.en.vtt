here<00:00:00.210> crater<00:00:00.630> in<00:00:01.140> Arizona<00:00:02.720> gouged<00:00:03.720> out<00:00:03.870> by<00:00:04.350> an

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
here crater in Arizona gouged out by an

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.910 
here crater in Arizona gouged out by an
asteroid<00:00:04.980> just<00:00:06.500> 150<00:00:07.500> feet<00:00:07.859> across

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
asteroid just 150 feet across

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.950 
asteroid just 150 feet across
you<00:00:10.430> can<00:00:10.580> see<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:11.000> huge<00:00:11.210> force<00:00:11.630> that

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
you can see the huge force that

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.010 
you can see the huge force that
excavated<00:00:12.620> this<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.730> you<00:00:13.880> can<00:00:14.030> also<00:00:14.210> see<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
excavated this and you can also see the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.200 
excavated this and you can also see the
layers<00:00:15.680> of<00:00:15.950> material<00:00:16.520> that<00:00:16.700> were<00:00:16.850> that<00:00:17.060> were

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
layers of material that were that were

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
layers of material that were that were
turned<00:00:17.630> over<00:00:18.460> as<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.090> crater<00:00:20.360> was<00:00:20.570> excavated

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
turned over as the crater was excavated

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.920 
turned over as the crater was excavated
and<00:00:21.349> so<00:00:21.710> some<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.430> these<00:00:22.550> rocks<00:00:22.849> around<00:00:23.750> here

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
and so some of these rocks around here

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.960 
and so some of these rocks around here
are<00:00:24.380> kind<00:00:24.860> of<00:00:24.890> upside-down<00:00:25.220> from<00:00:25.670> where<00:00:25.820> they

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
are kind of upside-down from where they

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.609 
are kind of upside-down from where they
started<00:00:28.359> there<00:00:29.359> have<00:00:29.510> been<00:00:29.690> millions<00:00:30.050> of

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
started there have been millions of

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.900 
started there have been millions of
impacts<00:00:31.190> like<00:00:31.520> this<00:00:31.880> in<00:00:32.540> Earth's<00:00:32.989> past<00:00:33.910> there

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
impacts like this in Earth's past there

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610 
impacts like this in Earth's past there
will<00:00:35.270> be<00:00:35.600> more

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
will be more

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.130 
will be more
imagine<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.739> city<00:00:39.219> where<00:00:39.940> meteor<00:00:40.359> crater<00:00:40.809> is

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
imagine a city where meteor crater is

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
imagine a city where meteor crater is
now

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
now

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.509 
now
let's<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.320> fireball<00:00:43.739> coming<00:00:44.309> through<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
let's see a fireball coming through the

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.580 
let's see a fireball coming through the
sky<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:45.300> quickly<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.559> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
sky very quickly you know this thing is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.340 
sky very quickly you know this thing is
moving<00:00:46.769> at<00:00:47.070> eight<00:00:47.399> miles<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.059> second<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
moving at eight miles a second and so it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
moving at eight miles a second and so it
wouldn't<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.920> long<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.519> move

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
wouldn't take very long for it to move

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.920 
wouldn't take very long for it to move
across<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> sky<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> strike<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> ground

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
across the sky and strike the ground

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.259 
across the sky and strike the ground
heat<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> fireball<00:00:55.969> scorches<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
heat from the fireball scorches the

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.639 
heat from the fireball scorches the
surface<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:59.100> most<00:00:59.430> damage<00:01:00.210> comes<00:01:00.809> after<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
surface but most damage comes after the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.819 
surface but most damage comes after the
impact

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.039 

once<00:01:05.039> it<00:01:05.159> strikes<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> ground<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.479> takes<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
once it strikes the ground this takes a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
once it strikes the ground this takes a
few<00:01:07.350> seconds<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> create<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.509> short<00:01:09.810> time

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
few seconds to create so very short time

few seconds to create so very short time
