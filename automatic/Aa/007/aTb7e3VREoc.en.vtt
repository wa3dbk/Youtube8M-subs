road so it was around 70 kph so but and
that's<00:00:22.740> why<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> wanted<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.520> do<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.090> I

want to help people we will have two

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.300 
want to help people we will have two
cars<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> wire<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.170> pulls<00:00:29.070> them

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
cars on the wire that pulls them

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.460 
cars on the wire that pulls them
together<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.140> 60<00:00:31.140> kph<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.170> in<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
together and 60 kph so when we in the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.729 
together and 60 kph so when we in the
impact<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.450> 120<00:00:36.450> kph<00:00:37.340> together<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.739> yeah

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
impact we have 120 kph together and yeah

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
impact we have 120 kph together and yeah
we<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.130> all<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> dummies<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.910> everything

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
we have all the dummies and everything

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
we have all the dummies and everything
so<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> data<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.579> look

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so we get a lot of data out of it I look

00:00:44.850 --> 00:01:04.630 
so we get a lot of data out of it I look
so<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.710> car<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.100> behaving<00:00:47.820> correct

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.580 

you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.530 

well<00:01:14.590> Lisa<00:01:14.770> we've<00:01:15.009> seen<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> crash<00:01:15.610> you're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
well Lisa we've seen the crash you're

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.090 
well Lisa we've seen the crash you're
not<00:01:16.720> doing<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> analysis<00:01:17.470> what<00:01:17.979> are<00:01:18.040> you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
not doing the analysis what are you

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.749 
not doing the analysis what are you
looking<00:01:18.159> for<00:01:18.549> at<00:01:19.479> first<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:20.110> see<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.740> speed<00:01:21.310> how

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
looking for at first I see the speed how

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.330 
looking for at first I see the speed how
how<00:01:22.240> fast<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.869> car<00:01:23.080> went<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:24.009> i'm

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
how fast the car went and then i'm

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.280 
how fast the car went and then i'm
looking<00:01:24.759> through<00:01:24.970> my<00:01:25.240> checklist<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:26.049> have<00:01:26.229> a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
looking through my checklist I have a

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.039 
looking through my checklist I have a
checklist<00:01:26.530> on<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.100> lot<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.700> pages<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.869> then<00:01:29.020> I

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
checklist on a lot of pages and then I

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.620 
checklist on a lot of pages and then I
go<00:01:29.470> through<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.890> car<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.369> see<00:01:30.580> how<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.299> dummy

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
go through the car and see how the dummy

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.010 
go through the car and see how the dummy
impact<00:01:32.110> with<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.380> airbags<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.490> see<00:01:33.729> how

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
impact with the airbags and I see how

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.960 
impact with the airbags and I see how
the<00:01:35.020> car<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.289> deformed<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:36.759> take<00:01:36.939> a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
the car is deformed and just take a

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.090 
the car is deformed and just take a
quick<00:01:37.210> look<00:01:37.539> over<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.380> everything<00:01:38.920> it's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
quick look over so it's everything it's

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.660 
quick look over so it's everything it's
okay<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:41.140> after<00:01:41.439> that<00:01:41.560> we're<00:01:41.799> getting

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
okay and then after that we're getting

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.670 
okay and then after that we're getting
the<00:01:42.939> movies<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.600> films<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.200> we<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
the movies the films so we can the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.190 
the movies the films so we can the
high-speed<00:01:45.070> films<00:01:45.429> at<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:46.569> what<00:01:46.960> really

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
high-speed films at see what really

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.779 
high-speed films at see what really
happened<00:01:47.710> during<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.069> crash<00:01:48.250> because<00:01:48.520> it's

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
happened during the crash because it's

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.529 
happened during the crash because it's
go<00:01:48.940> pretty<00:01:49.509> fast<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.380> then<00:01:51.159> we<00:01:51.970> look<00:01:52.149> at<00:01:52.330> the

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
go pretty fast and then we look at the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.100 
go pretty fast and then we look at the
dummy<00:01:53.409> in<00:01:53.799> your<00:01:54.039> values<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:55.479> get<00:01:55.630> out<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
dummy in your values that we get out of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.710 
dummy in your values that we get out of
the<00:01:56.259> data<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.799> then<00:01:57.179> that<00:01:58.179> I<00:01:58.209> will<00:01:58.450> do<00:01:58.569> later

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
the data and then that I will do later

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.499 
the data and then that I will do later
today<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.350> tomorrow<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.009> analyze<00:02:00.520> them<00:02:00.759> just

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
today and tomorrow and analyze them just

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.149 
today and tomorrow and analyze them just
looking<00:02:01.840> at<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.229> car<00:02:02.470> seems<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.009> come

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
looking at it the car seems to have come

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.039 
looking at it the car seems to have come
out<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.580> impact<00:02:04.060> extraordinarily<00:02:04.630> well

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
out of the impact extraordinarily well

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.230 
out of the impact extraordinarily well
you<00:02:05.170> can<00:02:05.319> open<00:02:05.709> and<00:02:05.860> close<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.340> doors<00:02:06.580> so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
you can open and close the doors so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.180 
you can open and close the doors so
presumably<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.319> passengers<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.160> driver

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
presumably the passengers and the driver

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.039 
presumably the passengers and the driver
would<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:09.970> been<00:02:10.209> pretty<00:02:10.509> all<00:02:10.660> right<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
would have been pretty all right in the

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.990 
would have been pretty all right in the
trash<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.620> despite<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> speed<00:02:12.580> yeah

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
trash like this despite the speed yeah

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.180 
trash like this despite the speed yeah
yeah<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> will<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.870> that's<00:02:14.380> what<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.769> see<00:02:14.980> we

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
yeah it will and that's what we see we

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.690 
yeah it will and that's what we see we
see<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.549> safety<00:02:16.390> cage<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.410> where<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
see the safety cage that is where the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.300 
see the safety cage that is where the
dummy<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.870> compartment<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.769> everything

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
dummy is the compartment and everything

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.020 
dummy is the compartment and everything
