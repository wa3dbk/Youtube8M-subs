00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.930
 hello today i'm in company 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.050
 runner of the team know sojasun 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.660
 Yannick géraud and we will talk technology 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.870
 in technical school uphill with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.970
 annick in love with trajectory position 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.989
 we must adopt downhill with 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.449
 then the ideal period for 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 work in the mountains to start 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.670
 climb collars graded from mid 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.589
 April beginning of May since already the school 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 begins to be opened for for the 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.970
 Most banquet to mount it 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.960
 already easier 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.190
 it's the only way to really 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 reproduce really identically 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.840
 this effort after there have been some 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 little tips like their coach where 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.700
 I put 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.670
 I go back a little 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.979
 my front wheel and I'm making efforts to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.829
 three minutes to a certain certain 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.429
 powers that is the same as we are 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.429
 in the hulls 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.979
 dubois yannick is what you can me 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.079
 give some tips to progress 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.520
 uphill then to progress in August 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.750
 and so we have two types of climbers the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.869
 climbers that world in fits and starts it's to 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.920
 to say in a pretty alternating dancer and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.750
 climbers like me as tall as 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.280
 this one is so when we sit 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.520
 it's a lot of velocity 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.520
 of legs 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.929
 so that's your mistake jérôme know that 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.939
 you have a little big for the la the length 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.310
 of the road and I think at level one 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.629
 when you you're jeans will brault 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.469
 harden because you have too big it 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.369
 should you put a little more 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.840
 flexible ie put the little 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.420
 plateau and in addition is in velocity 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.220
 okay, that's to say turn the jeans 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 marry the equivalent of yours yeah here 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.609
 so we say good velocity in 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.670
 mountain these 85 rpm minute 90 is very 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.900
 high it starts to dig in the mountains 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.950
 we professionals do not use 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.650
 more gearing of 39 25 or even 30 9 27 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.349
 for very difficult school after for 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.389
 a sports cyclo I think the triple 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.290
 plateau it's a good compromise or the 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.950
 compaq 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.540
 it's a good gear to follow 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.569
 several flights and can be done 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.569
 pleasure 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.410
 good then we make a small attack in 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.200
 rule it can not last very long 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 in those of the coup goodnight good enough 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.680
 quickly and keep that velocity 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.680
 oh yes there his satire on the legs 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.390
 so the advice that I could give 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.280
 downhill it's already to be very 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.620
 released how can this ever 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.380
 to be tense especially to look far ahead 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.850
 that's very important and that's what 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.340
 will allow us to take good 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.930
 trajectories and afterwards in turns 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.180
 it is always the same rule his 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.360
 interior exteriors to keep the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.360
 speed 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.420
 downhill the cyclist must stay very 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.620
 concentrate that's why it's 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.630
 difficult to refuel 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.490
 so enjoy the next replace well 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.760
 hydrated and take its gel 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.760
 needs 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.750
 hence his choice
