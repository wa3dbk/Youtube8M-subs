to<00:03:52.910> come<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.180> at<00:03:53.330> all<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.780> really<00:03:54.410> curves<00:03:54.709> to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
to come up at all it really curves to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.890 
to come up at all it really curves to
the<00:03:55.340> actual<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.070> actual<00:03:58.600> body<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.780> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
the actual to the actual body of the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.060 
the actual to the actual body of the
phone<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.640> let's<00:04:01.790> do<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.120> on<00:04:02.330> here<00:04:02.950> see<00:04:03.950> how

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
phone so let's do this on here see how

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.060 
phone so let's do this on here see how
this<00:04:04.280> works<00:04:05.020> see<00:04:06.020> if<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.200> like<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.470> if<00:04:06.739> not<00:04:06.920> I'll

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
this works see if I like it if not I'll

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.770 
this works see if I like it if not I'll
take<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.430> off<00:04:07.610> but<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.150> should<00:04:08.600> be<00:04:08.630> okay

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
take it off but it should be okay

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.400 
take it off but it should be okay
actually<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:13.630> wasn't<00:04:14.630> going<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:14.930> put<00:04:15.110> this<00:04:15.230> one

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
actually I wasn't going to put this one

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.710 
actually I wasn't going to put this one
on<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:16.010> really<00:04:16.040> like<00:04:16.669> how<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.090> looks<00:04:17.359> I

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
on but I really like how it looks I

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.320 
on but I really like how it looks I
guess<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.830> this<00:04:19.370> might<00:04:19.729> work<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
guess it this might work with the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.710 
guess it this might work with the
tempered<00:04:20.660> glass<00:04:21.850> if<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.060> are<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> person<00:04:23.690> who

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
tempered glass if you are a person who

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.050 
tempered glass if you are a person who
has<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:23.990> tempered<00:04:24.410> glass<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.970> are

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
has a tempered glass and you are

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.680 
has a tempered glass and you are
contemplating<00:04:27.520> yeah<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.729> LED<00:04:29.090> light<00:04:29.300> shines

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
contemplating yeah the LED light shines

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.840 
contemplating yeah the LED light shines
nice<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.560> bright<00:04:30.710> through<00:04:30.979> and<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.700> don't

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
nice and bright through and you don't

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.730 
nice and bright through and you don't
need<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.060> heat<00:04:32.210> up<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.479> front<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.620> it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
need to heat up the front and if it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.680 
need to heat up the front and if it
anytime<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.130> want<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.460> peel<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:34.820> off<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.390> going

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
anytime I want to peel this off is going

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.450 
anytime I want to peel this off is going
to<00:04:35.780> be<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> lot<00:04:36.110> simpler<00:04:36.500> easier<00:04:36.860> because<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.340> can

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
to be a lot simpler easier because I can

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.560 
to be a lot simpler easier because I can
just<00:04:37.520> take<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.850> tempered<00:04:38.120> glass<00:04:38.150> off

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
just take the tempered glass off

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.050 
just take the tempered glass off
completely<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:40.130> tempered<00:04:40.370> glass<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.550> on<00:04:40.850> here

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
completely the tempered glass is on here

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.570 
completely the tempered glass is on here
is<00:04:41.210> really<00:04:41.780> really<00:04:42.080> thin<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:43.040> works<00:04:43.460> out

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
is really really thin so that works out

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.190 
is really really thin so that works out
perfect<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.180> might<00:04:44.390> go<00:04:44.570> ahead<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:44.990> put

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
perfect so I might go ahead and just put

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.760 
perfect so I might go ahead and just put
this<00:04:45.350> one<00:04:45.410> on<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.850> front<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:47.930> for<00:04:48.169> now<00:04:48.380> I

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
this one on on the front but for now I

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.640 
this one on on the front but for now I
think<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.760> device<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.300> going<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.020> be<00:04:51.140> very

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
think this device is going to be very

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.280 
think this device is going to be very
well<00:04:52.280> taken<00:04:52.910> care<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.180> now<00:04:53.450> for<00:04:53.690> scrapes<00:04:54.050> and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
well taken care of now for scrapes and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.020 
well taken care of now for scrapes and
bumps<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.190> things<00:04:55.340> like<00:04:55.580> that

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
bumps and things like that

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.140
