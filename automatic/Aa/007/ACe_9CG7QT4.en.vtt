other<00:00:26.039> tutorials<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.150> does<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
other tutorials out there that does this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.560 
other tutorials out there that does this
in<00:00:28.439> fact<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.070> don't<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.400> there's<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in fact I don't know there's probably a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
in fact I don't know there's probably a
better<00:00:30.720> way<00:00:30.900> than<00:00:31.260> doing<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.180> mine<00:00:33.180> works

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
better way than doing it but mine works

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
better way than doing it but mine works
so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.710> way<00:00:36.050> again<00:00:37.050> you're<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.940 
so I do it my way again you're going to
need<00:00:38.460> easy<00:00:39.300> precision<00:00:39.980> multi<00:00:40.980> parent<00:00:42.950> access

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
need easy precision multi parent access

need easy precision multi parent access
to<00:00:44.129> old<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.550> course<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.860> I<00:00:47.300> use<00:00:48.300> wire<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.989> use

the ground so you can kind of pick it up
I<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.330> gate<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.380> small

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I just use this gate because it's small

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
I just use this gate because it's small
it's<00:01:20.729> round<00:01:21.830> works<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> past<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.790> no

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's round works in the past for me no

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's round works in the past for me no
problem<00:01:25.790> okay<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:28.729> definitely<00:01:29.729> no<00:01:30.540> client

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
problem okay so definitely no client

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.580 
problem okay so definitely no client
with<00:01:31.380> everything<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.700> click<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
with everything right click you know and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
with everything right click you know and
we're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.360> place<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:37.880> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
we're going to place this kind of like a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.289 
we're going to place this kind of like a
hinge<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.590> exactly<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.189> hinge

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.080 

because<00:01:45.890> that's<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.880> what

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because that's what it is that's what

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
because that's what it is that's what
it's<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:51.470> think<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's going to be so I think that's not

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's going to be so I think that's not
too<00:01:53.100> bad<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:54.470> we<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.619> place<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
too bad actually we got place it in the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.139 
too bad actually we got place it in the
middle<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:57.840> not

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
middle I'm gonna have to say that's not

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.740 
middle I'm gonna have to say that's not
quite<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:02.930> think<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:04.049> too<00:02:04.170> much<00:02:05.750> whatever

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
quite I think that's too much whatever

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
quite I think that's too much whatever
doesn't<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.439> perfect<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.399> I'll

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
doesn't have to be perfect and I'll

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it for the hood you can copy it it's the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
it for the hood you can copy it it's the
same<00:02:19.660> idea<00:02:19.990> for<00:02:20.170> everything<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> trunk<00:02:20.950> but

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
same idea for everything the trunk but

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.980 
same idea for everything the trunk but
don't<00:02:21.700> ya<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.900> cool<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.900> we're

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
course after we make the hood through

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.620 
course after we make the hood through
the<00:02:37.239> better<00:02:37.420> outline<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.360> what's

the better outline but this is what's
going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.040> lift<00:02:42.040> when<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.610> lift<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> hood<00:02:43.180> right

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
going to lift when I lift the hood right

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
move that's how you make a hinge then of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.249 
move that's how you make a hinge then of
course<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.300> said<00:04:39.219> um<00:04:40.219> make<00:04:40.849> sure<00:04:40.879> it<00:04:41.509> is<00:04:41.539> it

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
course like I said um make sure it is it

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.279 
course like I said um make sure it is it
is<00:04:42.530> locked<00:04:43.099> with<00:04:43.520> your<00:04:44.150> shifty<00:04:44.750> on<00:04:44.930> your<00:04:45.080> fist

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289

is locked with your shifty on your fist
gun<00:04:45.469> when<00:04:46.069> you<00:04:46.189> place<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.900> because<00:04:47.900> if<00:04:48.680> you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
gun when you place it because if you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.860 
gun when you place it because if you
don't<00:04:48.979> then<00:04:49.849> it's<00:04:50.180> not<00:04:50.360> going<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.599> be<00:04:50.659> straight

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
don't then it's not going to be straight

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.899 
don't then it's not going to be straight
like<00:04:50.900> in<00:04:51.199> this<00:04:51.319> case<00:04:51.379> I<00:04:51.830> can<00:04:52.159> I<00:04:52.400> can<00:04:52.669> be<00:04:52.789> like

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
straight so I shifty and that's

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.700 
straight so I shifty and that's
completely<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.569> way<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.780> was<00:04:56.990> which<00:04:57.560> is

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
completely the way it was which is

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.520 
completely the way it was which is
awesome<00:04:57.860> right<00:04:58.330> but<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.960> were<00:05:00.139> to<00:05:00.199> say

align it you know differently where
where<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.460> shifty<00:05:04.940> was<00:05:05.659> diagonal<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:09.080> would

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
where the shifty was diagonal it would

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.589 
where the shifty was diagonal it would
you<00:05:09.830> need<00:05:10.310> some<00:05:10.639> work<00:05:10.759> but<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:11.330> it's<00:05:11.509> not

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
you need some work but if it's not

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.830 
you need some work but if it's not

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
degrees or whatever and shifted e then

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.869 
degrees or whatever and shifted e then
you<00:05:18.110> know<00:05:18.259> you<00:05:18.529> never<00:05:18.650> know<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:19.279> could<00:05:19.310> shift

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
you know you never know you could shift

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.149 
you know you never know you could shift
