that's<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> telling<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> something

years if there isn't a reason behind it

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
years if there isn't a reason behind it
my<00:01:04.140> guess<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.920> they're<00:01:05.400> stocking<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
my guess is that they're stocking up on

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.429 
my guess is that they're stocking up on
the<00:01:06.360> physical<00:01:07.460> gold<00:01:08.600> because<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:10.170> could

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the physical gold because they could

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.190 
the physical gold because they could
well<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.920> an<00:01:11.189> economic<00:01:11.760> crisis<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
well be an economic crisis and if that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
well be an economic crisis and if that
is<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> case<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.520> heading<00:01:15.210> towards

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
is the case if we are heading towards

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
is the case if we are heading towards
economic<00:01:15.810> crisis<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> media<00:01:17.670> would

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
economic crisis not as the media would

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120 
economic crisis not as the media would
have<00:01:18.030> us<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> everything<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.590> fine<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
have us say that everything is fine and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.350 
have us say that everything is fine and
we're<00:01:20.250> coming<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
we're coming out of it and all that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
we're coming out of it and all that
nonsense<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.220> opinion<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.259> think<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
nonsense in my opinion I think that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
nonsense in my opinion I think that
we're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.570> fact<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.900> gold

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
we're going to see the fact that gold

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
we're going to see the fact that gold
still<00:01:29.040> hasn't<00:01:29.490> gone<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.790> substantially<00:01:30.590> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
still hasn't gone up substantially this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
still hasn't gone up substantially this
year<00:01:31.950> yet<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.869> possibly<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.960> reason<00:01:34.409> why

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
year yet is possibly a reason why

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
year yet is possibly a reason why
they're<00:01:34.979> buying<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> moment<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.299> mean

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
they're buying it at the moment I mean

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.770 
they're buying it at the moment I mean
it's<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.689> exactly<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> low<00:01:37.439> price<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.780> 1106

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's not exactly a low price at 1106

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's not exactly a low price at 1106
right<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.950> i'm<00:01:41.130> doing<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.460> video<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.479> at

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
right now as i'm doing this video but at

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
right now as i'm doing this video but at
the<00:01:42.720> same<00:01:42.930> time<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:44.159> considerably<00:01:44.759> less

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the same time it's considerably less

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770 
the same time it's considerably less
than<00:01:45.240> 12<00:01:45.540> 27<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.780> last

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
than 12 27 which is what it was last

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
than 12 27 which is what it was last
year<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:51.210> conclusion<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
year so my conclusion is that the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
year so my conclusion is that the
writing's<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.329> wall<00:01:54.450> folks<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
writing's on the wall folks if you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.580 
writing's on the wall folks if you
haven't<00:01:56.399> already<00:01:56.670> protected<00:01:57.659> yourself<00:01:57.780> by

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
haven't already protected yourself by

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
haven't already protected yourself by
getting<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.100> small<00:01:59.520> amount<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.180> physical<00:02:00.530> gold

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
getting a small amount of physical gold

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.609 
getting a small amount of physical gold
and<00:02:01.950> silver<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.329> encourage<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.079> do

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and silver then i encourage you to do

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.399 
and silver then i encourage you to do
that<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.479> central<00:02:06.930> banks<00:02:07.259> are

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that get into the central banks are

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
that get into the central banks are
doing<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.759> might<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.119> well<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.479> along

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
doing it you might as well do it along

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
doing it you might as well do it along
with<00:02:10.020> them

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
with them

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.520 
with them
then<00:02:11.039> you'll<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.430> something<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.000> trade

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
then you'll have something to trade

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.260 
then you'll have something to trade
should<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.710> very<00:02:13.920> worst<00:02:14.220> happen<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.880> you'll

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
should the very worst happen and you'll

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.810 
should the very worst happen and you'll
also<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.870> something<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
also have something that will go up in
