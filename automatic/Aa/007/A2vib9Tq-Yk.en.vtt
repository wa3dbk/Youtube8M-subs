00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
playing what should be played there are

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.460 
playing what should be played there are
some<00:00:37.059> specific<00:00:37.300> techniques<00:00:38.020> that<00:00:38.170> I'd<00:00:38.290> like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
some specific techniques that I'd like

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.500 
some specific techniques that I'd like
to<00:00:38.620> share<00:00:38.829> with<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.190> right<00:00:39.399> now<00:00:39.430> for<00:00:39.880> example

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
to share with you right now for example

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.800 
to share with you right now for example
if<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.290> play<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:42.580> sort<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.210> like<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.630> middle

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
if I play in sort of like in the middle

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.740 
if I play in sort of like in the middle
range<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.650> piano<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.600> my

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
range of the piano like so and my

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.730 
range of the piano like so and my
textures<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:48.430> kind<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.030> busy<00:00:49.300> like<00:00:49.750> this<00:00:50.080> you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
textures are kind of busy like this you

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.540 
textures are kind of busy like this you
find<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.160> difficult<00:00:51.400> to<00:00:51.820> hear

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.680 

our<00:00:55.090> focus<00:00:55.480> on<00:00:55.809> because<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.910> all<00:00:58.120> hard<00:00:58.510> to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
our focus on because it's all hard to

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.110 
our focus on because it's all hard to
focus<00:00:58.930> on<00:00:59.200> because<00:00:59.649> your<00:00:59.920> ear<00:01:00.220> is<00:01:00.399> conflicted

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
focus on because your ear is conflicted

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.170 
focus on because your ear is conflicted
with<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.410> busyness<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.190> also<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.940> same

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
with the busyness and also in the same

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.590 
with the busyness and also in the same
register<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:06.369> I'm<00:01:06.580> playing<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.180> it's<00:01:07.420> in

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
register that I'm playing in is it's in

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.060 
register that I'm playing in is it's in
the<00:01:07.659> same<00:01:07.869> register<00:01:08.170> as<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.440> human<00:01:08.740> voice<00:01:08.920> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the same register as the human voice so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180 
the same register as the human voice so
solution<00:01:12.420> simplify<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.479> playing<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.190> move

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
solution simplify the playing and move

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.710 
solution simplify the playing and move
it<00:01:15.369> a<00:01:15.460> little<00:01:15.490> bit<00:01:16.060> out<00:01:16.210> of<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.780> range<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
it a little bit out of the range so this

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.800 
it a little bit out of the range so this
is<00:01:19.750> better<00:01:20.259> you<00:01:20.800> can<00:01:20.979> hear<00:01:21.369> as<00:01:22.090> I'm<00:01:22.300> talking

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
is better you can hear as I'm talking

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.540 
is better you can hear as I'm talking
and<00:01:22.930> playing<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.100> little<00:01:24.369> better<00:01:26.550> but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
and playing it's a little better but

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.330 
and playing it's a little better but
it's<00:01:27.729> still<00:01:27.850> not<00:01:28.270> quite<00:01:28.570> there<00:01:28.660> because<00:01:29.440> it's

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
it's still not quite there because it's

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's still not quite there because it's
too<00:01:30.610> busy<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.360> there's<00:01:31.660> still<00:01:31.990> remnants<00:01:32.350> that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
too busy and there's still remnants that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.830 
too busy and there's still remnants that
of<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.640> sound<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.119> occur<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.660> same

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
of the sound that occur in the same

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
of the sound that occur in the same
frequency<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.410> mice<00:01:35.740> as<00:01:36.160> my<00:01:36.399> speaking<00:01:36.820> voice

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
frequency as mice as my speaking voice

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.590 
frequency as mice as my speaking voice
watch<00:01:38.890> what<00:01:39.100> happens<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:39.700> when<00:01:40.179> I<00:01:40.240> move

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
watch what happens now when I move

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.109 
watch what happens now when I move
completely<00:01:41.289> out<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:42.009> range<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.700> I

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
completely out of the range and I

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.380 
completely out of the range and I
simplify<00:01:43.539> just<00:01:44.050> by<00:01:44.200> playing<00:01:44.470> intervals<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:48.390> can

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
simplify just by playing intervals I can

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.669 
simplify just by playing intervals I can
talk<00:01:49.600> all<00:01:49.869> day<00:01:50.200> long<00:01:50.440> now<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:53.229> interfere

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
talk all day long now and not interfere

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.700 
talk all day long now and not interfere
at<00:01:54.159> all<00:01:54.399> with<00:01:54.460> what's<00:01:55.060> going<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.899> if<00:01:56.560> I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
at all with what's going on and if I

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.490 
at all with what's going on and if I
listen<00:01:57.220> carefully<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.000> scripture<00:01:58.500> it'll

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
listen carefully to the scripture it'll

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.359 
listen carefully to the scripture it'll
lead<00:01:59.679> me<00:01:59.709> to<00:01:59.979> play<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.810> right<00:02:01.989> thing<00:02:02.380> it'll

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
lead me to play the right thing it'll

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.229 
lead me to play the right thing it'll
teach<00:02:03.610> me<00:02:03.910> when<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.450> pause<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:06.130> when<00:02:07.090> to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
teach me when to pause and when to

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.429 
teach me when to pause and when to
access<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.160> sacred<00:02:09.160> space
