I'm<00:02:25.650> hoping<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.100> they<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.630> bunch<00:02:28.140> of

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
I'm hoping is they don't get a bunch of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.830 
I'm hoping is they don't get a bunch of
amateur<00:02:29.490> voice<00:02:29.820> actors<00:02:30.300> or<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.750> like

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
amateur voice actors or something like

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
amateur voice actors or something like
that<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.230> play<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:31.920> imagine<00:02:32.550> for

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
that to play so if you just imagine for

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.660 
that to play so if you just imagine for
a<00:02:32.790> second<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.080> pageant<00:02:34.290> Goku<00:02:35.070> as<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
a second like a pageant Goku as a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 
a second like a pageant Goku as a
different<00:02:36.240> voice<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.230> don't<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
different voice like you don't have the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.430 
different voice like you don't have the
original<00:02:38.370> voice<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.200> what's<00:02:40.350> his

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
original voice and I think what's his

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.670 
original voice and I think what's his
name<00:02:40.590> seen<00:02:41.070> something<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.240> site<00:02:42.720> s<00:02:42.900> ii

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
name seen something like this site s ii

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
name seen something like this site s ii
and<00:02:44.520> something<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.630> his<00:02:45.840> name

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and something like that that's his name

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.560 
and something like that that's his name
of<00:02:47.630> imagining<00:02:48.630> somebody<00:02:48.959> other<00:02:49.350> than<00:02:49.500> him

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
of imagining somebody other than him

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.330 
of imagining somebody other than him
playing<00:02:51.570> as<00:02:51.840> goku<00:02:52.200> i<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:52.830> can't<00:02:53.070> imagine

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
playing as goku i just can't imagine

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.790 
playing as goku i just can't imagine
because<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.420> voice<00:02:54.660> actors<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.290> me<00:02:55.500> are

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
because all the voice actors to me are

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.830 
because all the voice actors to me are
so<00:02:56.010> great<00:02:56.370> some<00:02:56.730> people<00:02:57.150> don't<00:02:57.330> like<00:02:57.420> them

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
so great some people don't like them

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360 
so great some people don't like them
that's<00:02:58.050> why<00:02:58.200> they<00:02:58.380> watch<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.770> japanese

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
that's why they watch the japanese

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.730 
that's why they watch the japanese
subtitles<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.150> stuff<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.570> hey<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.500> all
