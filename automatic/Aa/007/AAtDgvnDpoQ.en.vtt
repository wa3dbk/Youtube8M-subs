00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.899
 What do you think? Do you like it here? 

00:00:09.257 --> 00:00:11.592
 - Why? Will we move again? - No. 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.734
 She changed her name. 

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:15.685
 Will I also get a new name? 

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:17.342
 I think yes. What is your name? 

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:18.698
 Fionna Elisabeth. 

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:20.426
 She changed her appearance. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.552
 I like this. 

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:28.059
 But nothing could protect her ... 

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:34.665
 ... in front of the most dangerous man she ever met. 

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:37.290
 Her husband. 

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:38.351
 - I want you back. - No. 

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.011
 - It'll be like before. - No. 

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.153
 Mom! 

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.099
 We're in the information age, darling. 

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:45.458
 You leave traces everywhere. 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:48.529
 You can't run forever. 

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.272
 Why not? I'm good at it. 

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:53.136
 Your account may have been frozen. 

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.494
 This is horrible. He's trying to scare me. 

00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.560
 What about the windows in your apartment? Still locked? 

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.025
 It's strange to know, isn't it? 

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.628
 Hi Gracie. 

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:09.364
 - Gracie! - Mom, Mom, look at me. 

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:14.158
 You know, love is a terrible thing. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.193
 It is very powerful what it will do to you. 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:21.278
 The police can't help you. 

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.525
 Nobody can help you. 

00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:29.052
 We have to wait until he comes back. 

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:30.473
 Before he kills you. 

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:34.038
 FROM COLUMBIA PICTURES 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.434
 You have God's animal right ... 

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:40.435
 ... to protect yourself and your child. 

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:43.710
 - Ready? - Yes. 

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:46.598
 I need a woman who looks like me. 

00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.543
 I want Mitch to think I'm here in San Francisco. 

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:52.124
 How do you win? 

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.562
 If I attack. 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.623
 And what do you do then? 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.059
 JENNIFER LOPEZOVÁ 

00:01:58.211 --> 00:01:59.876
 I won't stop attacking. 

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:07.747
 Self-defense is not murder. 

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:11.350
 ENOUGH 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.760
 - You are afraid? - What? 

00:02:13.223 --> 00:02:13.895
 Me. ------------------------------ acfbbd18ff5b--
