00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.889
 hello very good to all I'm furious this 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.689
 Once we are on the golden gate bridge 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.210
 in many of edith let's see a trick 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.000
 to be invincible and create a barrier 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.590
 it is advisable that in the trick you 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.509
 the player of white color since by 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.849
 preference is where will the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.560
 zombies is not worth how to build the plane 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.750
 to come here you can see it in the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.280
 description and once you are very much in 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.140
 the golden gate point you come here 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.380
 where are the electric chairs between 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.540
 the last and penultimate step pointing 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.310
 rather towards here and suicide you jce 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.840
 it's worth with a grenade to enter mode 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.820
 make live 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.920
 but with this you will lose the advantages that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.739
 have so if you plan to do 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.230
 the trick because it does not swell us 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.300
 buy advantages because we are not going to 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.430
 lose is worth with this we will be there 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.620
 between the stairs is then worth a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.360
 Once we rebel we will almost be 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.150
 completely tucked, then we are 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 we crouch we will be almost already stuck in 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.900
 the trick is worth leaving water 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.180
 the last zombie to be able to do this 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.540
 I pass quietly and apart we will have 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.490
 to make the zombie come and give us a 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.530
 last push to finish us from 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 place correctly 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 banesto now once the zombie is 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.750
 put us over, ok, we'll have 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.990
 pushed all the way we will be 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.970
 completely stuck and there and then no 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.710
 they will give us no blow we create and 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.110
 we will create a barrier as you can see 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.399
 the big heads these we have to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.009
 shoot at the head they also go 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.780
 pile up there and that has been all 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.670
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 in the next video until next time 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.740
 do not 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.740
 here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 how
