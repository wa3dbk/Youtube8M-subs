00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.850 

so<00:01:13.600> I'm<00:01:13.689> still<00:01:13.929> not<00:01:14.049> a<00:01:14.110> hundred<00:01:14.200> percent<00:01:14.469> sure

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
so I'm still not a hundred percent sure

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.300 
so I'm still not a hundred percent sure
on<00:01:15.159> when<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.340> should<00:01:15.549> drop<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.969> Nexus<00:01:17.310> like

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
on when I should drop the Nexus like

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
on when I should drop the Nexus like
what<00:01:18.490> would<00:01:18.640> be<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.789> good<00:01:18.850> time<00:01:19.240> for<00:01:19.299> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.960 

definitely<00:01:40.689> after<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.110> core<00:01:41.349> I<00:01:41.380> think<00:01:41.849> cuz<00:01:42.849> we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
definitely after the core I think cuz we

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.339 
definitely after the core I think cuz we
still<00:01:43.179> want<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.509> still<00:01:43.750> want<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.929> play<00:01:44.020> safe

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
still want it we still want to play safe

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:57.449 
still want it we still want to play safe
like<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.739> don't<00:01:44.920> want<00:01:45.069> dessert<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.579> Russia<00:01:56.459> so

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
like we don't want dessert to Russia so

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.039 
like we don't want dessert to Russia so
we'll<00:01:57.610> start<00:01:57.819> a<00:01:57.939> zealot<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.599> case<00:01:58.780> of

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
we'll start a zealot just in case of

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.029 
we'll start a zealot just in case of
like<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.590> 12<00:02:00.489> pool<00:02:00.759> or<00:02:00.939> something<00:02:01.119> like<00:02:01.420> that

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
like a 12 pool or something like that

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:14.910 
like a 12 pool or something like that
