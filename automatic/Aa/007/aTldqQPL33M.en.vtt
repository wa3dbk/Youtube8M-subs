golden<00:00:49.260> speckling<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:52.699> this<00:00:53.699> tree<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
golden speckling on here this tree is

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
golden speckling on here this tree is
approximately<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.340> years<00:00:56.370> old<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.960> been

approximately two years old and has been
watered<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.250> irrigated<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> program<00:01:00.899> that

watered or irrigated with a program that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
watered or irrigated with a program that
reduces<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> pH<00:01:02.940> content<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.559> right

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
reduces the pH content that all right

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.530 
reduces the pH content that all right
about<00:01:05.700> more<00:01:06.090> than<00:01:06.330> talk<00:01:06.689> about<00:01:08.420> reduces<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
about more than talk about reduces the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
about more than talk about reduces the
pee<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> water<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:11.659> helps<00:01:13.250> floor<00:01:14.250> push<00:01:14.729> out

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
pee to the water in helps floor push out

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.219 
pee to the water in helps floor push out
this<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.869> beautiful<00:01:16.080> strong<00:01:16.799> growth<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
this really beautiful strong growth and

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
this really beautiful strong growth and
it's<00:01:19.229> also<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> root<00:01:20.100> stock<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.330> more

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's also on a root stock that is more

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's also on a root stock that is more
hard<00:01:22.049> water<00:01:22.350> salt<00:01:22.950> tolerant<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> don't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
hard water salt tolerant so you don't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.890 
hard water salt tolerant so you don't
have<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> burnt<00:01:25.619> foliage<00:01:26.280> tips<00:01:26.900> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
have all that burnt foliage tips that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
have all that burnt foliage tips that
often<00:01:28.350> occur<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.780> avocado<00:01:30.780> varieties<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:35.220> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
often occur in avocado varieties you can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.630 
often occur in avocado varieties you can
see<00:01:35.759> again<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.600> nice<00:01:36.960> beautiful<00:01:37.530> fruit<00:01:38.070> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
see again really nice beautiful fruit it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
see again really nice beautiful fruit it
has<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.810> naturally<00:01:40.320> has<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
has that it naturally has a the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
has that it naturally has a the
distinction<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.810> golden<00:01:43.619> coloring

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
distinction is that the golden coloring

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.530 
distinction is that the golden coloring
in<00:01:44.729> their<00:01:46.549> yellow<00:01:47.549> speckling<00:01:48.119> golden

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
in their yellow speckling golden

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.690 
in their yellow speckling golden
speckling<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:52.250> another<00:01:53.250> advantage

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
speckling in here and another advantage

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
speckling in here and another advantage
is<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.540> compact<00:01:55.200> tree<00:01:55.710> than<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is it's a more compact tree than the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.560 
is it's a more compact tree than the
traditional<00:01:57.299> Haws<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.820> produces<00:01:59.820> crops<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.479> a
