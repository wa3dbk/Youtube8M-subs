00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
something a little bit different um I

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.619 
something a little bit different um I
don't<00:00:05.069> really<00:00:05.250> consider<00:00:05.430> myself<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:06.180> big<00:00:06.359> gamer

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
don't really consider myself a big gamer

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.379 
don't really consider myself a big gamer
but<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.470> 9<00:00:07.799> or<00:00:07.830> 8<00:00:08.550> years<00:00:08.849> ago<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.179> don't

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
but about 9 or 8 years ago I don't

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.680 
but about 9 or 8 years ago I don't
remember<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.559> played<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> game<00:00:11.610> called<00:00:11.639> Spyro<00:00:12.420> 2

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
remember I played a game called Spyro 2

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.230 
remember I played a game called Spyro 2
and<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.559> never<00:00:13.830> completed<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> whole<00:00:14.820> thing

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and I never completed the whole thing

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.240 
and I never completed the whole thing
getting<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.520> gems<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.670> orbs<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.250> guess

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
getting all the gems and orbs so I guess

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.310 
getting all the gems and orbs so I guess
I<00:00:20.369> fired<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> an<00:00:21.150> emulator<00:00:21.320> recently

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I fired it up on an emulator recently

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
I fired it up on an emulator recently
and<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> beat<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> way

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and I'm about to beat it all the way

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.140 
and I'm about to beat it all the way
through<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.310> gonna<00:00:26.400> record<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
through so I'm just gonna record this

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.470 
through so I'm just gonna record this
final<00:00:27.630> stage<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.670> powerup

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
final stage here and then the powerup

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440 
final stage here and then the powerup
that<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> gives<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> end<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.390> we

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that it gives you at the end so here we

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
that it gives you at the end so here we
go<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:45.260> basically<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> those

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
go so basically this is one of those

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.580 
go so basically this is one of those
Speedway<00:00:47.579> levels<00:00:48.059> where<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.110> tests

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
Speedway levels where basically it tests

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
Speedway levels where basically it tests
your<00:00:49.739> flying<00:00:49.980> skills<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
your flying skills and I don't really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
your flying skills and I don't really
like<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.770> guess<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.160> better<00:00:56.370> than

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
like them but I guess it's better than

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:08.640 
like them but I guess it's better than
Superman<00:00:57.090> 64<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:58.039> like<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> Rings<00:00:59.550> things

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.860 

so<00:01:09.650> six<00:01:10.400> more<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.820> go<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:11.000> can't<00:01:11.420> believe<00:01:11.720> that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
so six more to go I can't believe that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:32.649 
so six more to go I can't believe that
just<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.140> case

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:43.749 

I<00:01:32.689> better<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:41.500> all<00:01:42.500> right<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.190> got<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
I better be it all right we got it the

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.330 
I better be it all right we got it the
64th<00:01:44.390> or<00:01:44.979> finally<00:01:47.619> now<00:01:48.619> we<00:01:48.649> can<00:01:48.890> get<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.159> hell
