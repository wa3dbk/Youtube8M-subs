able<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.120> probably<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.569> away<00:03:32.690> with<00:03:32.810> cables

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
able to probably get away with cables

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.020 
able to probably get away with cables
that<00:03:33.379> are<00:03:33.409> 4<00:03:33.680> meters<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.280> 4<00:03:34.489> millimeters<00:03:34.700> in

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
that are 4 meters in to 4 millimeters in

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.789 
that are 4 meters in to 4 millimeters in
diameter<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:36.049> may<00:03:36.230> get<00:03:36.440> away<00:03:36.530> with

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
diameter and you may get away with

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.009 
diameter and you may get away with
cables<00:03:37.129> as<00:03:37.310> ever<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:37.970> slightly<00:03:38.239> bigger<00:03:38.569> maybe

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
cables as ever so slightly bigger maybe

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.229 
cables as ever so slightly bigger maybe
just<00:03:39.440> up<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.709> 6<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.159> any<00:03:40.370> more<00:03:40.579> than<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.940> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
just up to 6 but any more than that and

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.490 
just up to 6 but any more than that and
it's<00:03:41.420> not<00:03:41.540> going<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.780> fit<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:41.959> there<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.319> mean

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
it's not going to fit in there I mean

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.759 
it's not going to fit in there I mean
these<00:03:42.799> are<00:03:43.040> designed<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.730> telephone<00:03:44.269> cables

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
these are designed for telephone cables

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.920 
these are designed for telephone cables
so<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:46.159> want<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.459> join<00:03:46.609> like<00:03:47.060> for<00:03:47.299> like<00:03:47.450> now

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
so we want to join like for like now

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.210 
so we want to join like for like now
there's<00:03:48.109> not<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.260> huge<00:03:48.560> amount<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.829> room<00:03:49.069> in

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
there's not a huge amount of room in

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.970 
there's not a huge amount of room in
there<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:50.090> if<00:03:50.239> possible<00:03:50.690> try<00:03:51.349> to<00:03:51.440> stagger<00:03:51.859> your

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
there so if possible try to stagger your

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.250 
there so if possible try to stagger your
joints<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.459> little<00:03:52.700> bit<00:03:53.319> ok<00:03:54.319> so<00:03:55.569> I'm<00:03:56.569> going<00:03:56.720> to

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.509 

use<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.440> white<00:04:00.620> one<00:04:00.799> over<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:01.160> side<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:07.310> you

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
use the white one over this side if you

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.119 
use the white one over this side if you
were<00:04:07.639> just<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.849> put<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.389> joints<00:04:08.540> together

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
were just to put all the joints together

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.710 
were just to put all the joints together
then<00:04:10.129> you<00:04:10.639> might<00:04:10.819> find<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:11.180> quite<00:04:11.359> hard<00:04:11.629> to

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
then you might find it quite hard to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.259 
then you might find it quite hard to
bend<00:04:11.989> them<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.470> them<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.190> fit<00:04:13.340> them<00:04:13.489> in<00:04:13.639> if

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
bend them and them and fit them in if

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.729 
bend them and them and fit them in if
you<00:04:14.510> do<00:04:14.660> them<00:04:14.780> like<00:04:14.900> this<00:04:14.959> you'll<00:04:15.379> find<00:04:15.650> this

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
you do them like this you'll find this

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.490 
you do them like this you'll find this
easier<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.299> push<00:04:17.510> push<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.139> right<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
easier now you push push it right the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.469 
easier now you push push it right the
way<00:04:18.530> down<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.160> wires<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:19.669> all<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.329> way<00:04:20.419> to

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
way down so the wires go all the way to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.920 
way down so the wires go all the way to
the<00:04:20.660> end<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.959> crimp<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.729> then<00:04:22.729> close<00:04:23.720> them

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
the end of the crimp and then close them

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.839 
the end of the crimp and then close them
you<00:04:24.080> can<00:04:24.470> use<00:04:24.680> normal<00:04:24.889> pliers<00:04:25.310> like<00:04:25.669> I

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
you can use normal pliers like I

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.610 
you can use normal pliers like I
explained<00:04:26.210> in<00:04:26.360> my<00:04:26.510> video<00:04:27.050> about<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.349> jelly

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
explained in my video about the jelly

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.490 
explained in my video about the jelly
crimps<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.389> is<00:04:29.479> easy<00:04:29.810> if<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.139> have<00:04:30.260> one<00:04:30.410> of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
crimps but it is easy if you have one of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.379 
crimps but it is easy if you have one of
these<00:04:30.650> now<00:04:30.979> there<00:04:31.280> we<00:04:31.400> go<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.880> one's<00:04:32.030> nicely

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
these now there we go that one's nicely

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.230 
these now there we go that one's nicely
buried<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:34.220> now<00:04:34.370> we're<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.760> use<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
buried so now we're going to use the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.330 
buried so now we're going to use the
other<00:04:35.419> one<00:04:35.720> here<00:04:35.960> now<00:04:36.530> although<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.889> might

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
other one here now although you might

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.950 
other one here now although you might
only<00:04:37.550> have<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.880> one<00:04:38.030> telephone<00:04:38.360> line<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.750> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
only have the one telephone line and the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.240 
only have the one telephone line and the
might<00:04:39.110> be<00:04:39.199> just<00:04:39.380> running<00:04:39.470> down<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.889> white<00:04:40.070> and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
might be just running down the white and

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.240 
might be just running down the white and
oranges<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.720> wear<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.229> may<00:04:42.470> as<00:04:42.620> well<00:04:42.650> connect

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
oranges you wear you may as well connect

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.219 
oranges you wear you may as well connect
up<00:04:43.430> all<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.940> wires<00:04:44.120> because<00:04:44.750> then<00:04:44.990> in<00:04:45.110> the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
up all the wires because then in the

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.100 
up all the wires because then in the
future<00:04:45.410> if<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.370> ever<00:04:46.400> if<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.599> ever<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.080> a

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
future if you ever if you ever do have a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.950 
future if you ever if you ever do have a
second<00:04:48.530> line<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.419> engineer<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.720> not

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
second line and the engineer is not

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.180 
second line and the engineer is not
going<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.380> have<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.620> go<00:04:51.710> into<00:04:51.860> this<00:04:52.010> little

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
going to have to go into this little

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.980 
going to have to go into this little
joint<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:52.760> push<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.180> wires<00:04:53.360> through<00:04:53.599> so<00:04:53.870> it's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
joint so push the wires through so it's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.909 
joint so push the wires through so it's
always<00:04:54.140> good<00:04:54.349> practice<00:04:54.560> just<00:04:54.979> to

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
always good practice just to

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.610 
always good practice just to
all<00:04:56.159> the<00:04:56.430> wires<00:04:56.610> through<00:04:57.229> okay<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:58.289> that's<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
all the wires through okay so that's the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.339 
all the wires through okay so that's the
second<00:04:58.979> one<00:04:59.509> and<00:05:00.509> this<00:05:00.719> is<00:05:00.870> probably<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.199> bit

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
second one and this is probably a bit

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.570 
second one and this is probably a bit
boring<00:05:01.560> watching<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.069> but<00:05:02.340> I'm<00:05:02.400> just

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
boring watching this but I'm just

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.899 
boring watching this but I'm just
showing<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:02.849> how<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.060> do<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:07.520> okay<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.550> now

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
showing you how to do it okay so now

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:21.649 
showing you how to do it okay so now
we're<00:05:09.060> on<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.240> greens<00:05:19.789> again<00:05:20.789> all<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.449> wires

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
we're on the greens again all the wires

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.480 
we're on the greens again all the wires
are<00:05:21.840> pushing<00:05:22.050> getting<00:05:22.710> pushed<00:05:22.949> right<00:05:23.159> away<00:05:23.430> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
are pushing getting pushed right away to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.980 
are pushing getting pushed right away to
the<00:05:23.669> end<00:05:23.819> of<00:05:23.909> the<00:05:23.969> crimp<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.509> if<00:05:24.569> you<00:05:24.659> can<00:05:24.810> see

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
the end of the crimp and if you can see

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.689 
the end of the crimp and if you can see
that<00:05:25.169> or<00:05:25.259> not<00:05:25.379> but<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.860> wise<00:05:26.069> go<00:05:26.279> all<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.550> way<00:05:26.580> to

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
that or not but a wise go all the way to

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:48.890 
that or not but a wise go all the way to
the<00:05:26.879> ends<00:05:47.120> again<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.270> wires<00:05:48.449> right<00:05:48.569> the<00:05:48.810> way

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the ends again the wires right the way

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.050 
the ends again the wires right the way
to<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.139> end<00:05:49.289> of<00:05:49.379> the<00:05:49.469> crimp<00:05:49.740> crimp<00:05:50.729> from<00:05:51.000> the

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
shuts push it into the gel and basically

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.159 
shuts push it into the gel and basically
when<00:05:56.969> we<00:05:57.089> close<00:05:57.300> this<00:05:57.479> clip<00:05:57.689> now<00:05:57.870> so<00:05:58.020> that's

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
when we close this clip now so that's

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.619 
when we close this clip now so that's
order<00:05:58.499> all<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.099> wires<00:05:59.310> in<00:05:59.550> there<00:05:59.759> and<00:06:00.089> you<00:06:00.419> can

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
order all the wires in there and you can

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.899 
order all the wires in there and you can
already<00:06:00.750> see<00:06:01.050> that<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.650> gel<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:02.339> the<00:06:02.550> jelly

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
already see that the gel that the jelly

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.700 
already see that the gel that the jelly
crimps<00:06:03.240> have<00:06:03.389> gel<00:06:03.719> in<00:06:03.870> them<00:06:04.080> already<00:06:04.289> so

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
crimps have gel in them already so

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.040
