00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.990
 hi all guys and welcome in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.910
 this fast video of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.349
 update as you all know from 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.610
 few minutes is available for download 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 ios 7.1.2 for all devices that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.279
 include from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5 s 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.650
 from the ipad 2 to the aipa their also included 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.050
 ipad mini an ipad mini 2 and also for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 the fifth generation iPod touch for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.710
 update directly from yours 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.470
 device is really very simple 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 just go to settings 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.020
 then go on to general 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.239
 software update 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.219
 as you can see the iPhone in a few seconds 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 ipod touch or ipad will find you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 update and just press 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 download and install to update the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
 your device as we see from 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.289
 changes were simply 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 fixed bugs but attention was 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.059
 solved a serious security problem 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.670
 that came with the mail application that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.690
 in practice on the previous versions 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.969
 allowed anyone to know how 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.129
 take advantage of that bug to read 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 secure attachments to emails therefore one 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.610
 which is quite worrying as you see 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 meanwhile I started the update 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.380
 on my iphone 5 which has no jailbreak 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 for all those who instead have a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 jailbreak device will not be 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.619
 able to view the update 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 in fact as you see in my case mine 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.060
 iphone 5 the jailbreak and if i go up 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 general update settings 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 software there will be the wheel that will turn 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 to infinity and that it will never find 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 update this because jailbreak 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.930
 and updates from the device not 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.939
 they get along 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090
 if you want to update yours 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.369
 jailbreak ad ios device 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.290
 7.1.2 you will need to connect it to your computer and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.200
 through itunes do a restore 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.970
 complete with the system you will lose all 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 data and you won't even be able to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.460
 restore from backup because backups 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.500
 jailbroken is always not recommended 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.350
 restore them to original firmware 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 anyway if you want to upgrade to ios 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.040
 7.1.2 your jailbroken device 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.450
 as already said you can do it however not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 you can do it directly from 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 device you will need to connect it to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.750
 computer open itunes and press on 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 restore button as you can see in the meantime 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.649
 the update has finished downloading 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.290
 on my iphone 5 just press the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.090
 button install 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.670
 will check for a few minutes 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
 the update subsequently the iphone 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.079
 it will reboot completely 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.670
 automatic we should not do 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.680
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.930
 during which a bar will appear 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 loading a loading bar that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.720
 indicates that the firmware is in progress 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.599
 installing on the device is a lot 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.640
 important not to touch any buttons 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.579
 during this phase simply 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.859
 let it work after about 5 minutes 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.599
 obviously I skipped them for not 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.180
 make your device too boring 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.879
 will be restarted again will be 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.010
 of the last reboot and once exactly 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.480
 rebooted we will be able to enjoy ios 7.1.2 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 installed successfully on ours 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.709
 device in my case as you see 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.769
 the iphone 5 has restarted in this 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.659
 instant we are reached at the screen 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.129
 block of course here too I put 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.200
 of the cuts actually the procedure is 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.780
 lasted much more like seeing them going 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.720
 on settings later going 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.629
 su generals and finally on info 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.729
 we are on the new build 7.1.2 11 of 257 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.699
 so here is an update ota 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:28.639
 so over the air was successful 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.500
 on my iphone 5 I still remember one 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.709
 instead of those who have a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 iphone ipod touch or ipad jailbroken 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.750
 will have to do a restore through 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.169
 itunes 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.989
 but let's move on to the most coveted question 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.269
 all of you this new update 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.479
 block the jailbreak of mud the answer 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.370
 it's no I updated my ipod touch's 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:52.959
 fifth generation and with my great 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.970
 surprise pango recognizes ios natively 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.799
 7.1.2 as compatible and comes to you 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.319
 the jailbreak follows so there is no 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.810
 worry about this firmware not just not 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.879
 blocks the jailbreak but more 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.470
 official tango will be able to 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.290
 recognize it so there will be no need 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.180
 to do as evasion is to download 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.979
 unofficial versions of the tool 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.620
 jailbreak as you can see I am on the site 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:18.009
 pang official and the same program 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.229
 pango immediately recognizes the new firmware 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.630
 7.1.2 how compatible I will prove it to you 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.610
 connecting the iphone 5 we have 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.340
 updated just two minutes ago together 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.710
 as you can see, I connect it to the computer and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.740
 pang recognizes the instant and tells me 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.880
 connect iphone 5.2 with ios 7.1.2 is 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.340
 supported and obviously pressing on 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.660
 jailbreak button we could start the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.700
 unlocking procedure 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.950
 the last thing I want to tell you is that 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.110
 pang also supports devices 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.940
 updated via ote as opposed to 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.010
 evasion so even if you have 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.560
 updated your device precisely 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.420
 from the device then from settings 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.810
 general info you can easily 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.940
 jailbreak pang on the new 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.070
 7.1.2 and you will not run risks therefore 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.830
 boys we draw the sums is convenient or not 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.410
 it is worth updating to this new 7.1.2 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.280
 for all those who already have the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.300
 untethered jailbreak on 7.1.1 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.400
 I advise against updating because 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.320
 surely in the coming days it subsidizes 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.020
 packages will come out that 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.340
 will introduce the same bug fixes that 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.320
 introduces 7.1.2 on 7.1.1 while if 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.290
 you have another device without 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.510
 jailbreak then virgin updated it 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.480
 also through ote because you can so much 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.100
 however make up the jailbreak with mud 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.210
 and in any case, remember that 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.310
 this 7.1.2 introduces an important fix 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.630
 of privacy for email attachments therefore 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.130
 guys if this short video is there 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.420
