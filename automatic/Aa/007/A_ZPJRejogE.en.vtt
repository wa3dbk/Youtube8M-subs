00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 look at people that happens when 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 you trained too much i just wanted to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.250
 do not lean against the tree and short 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.469
 he succumbed now how fast before the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.570
 ranger comes here behave himself 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.570
 anyway again like the ax in the woods 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.949
 especially the joggers have to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.680
 of course hellishly watch out for these 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.750
 both fight bed 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.809
 So, what is it all about today ? 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 important topic and that is brown in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.590
 America's well-known human being too 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.670
 quite a few motivation videos and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.200
 Today you can open yourselves 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 Look at youtube brown very much 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.719
 interestingly he speaks in many cases 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.110
 his videos and also in some texts 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 and so on ice time , it means time so 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 the picture in german as much as that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 you can see with the eye 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 and what your mind can see 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 and that sounds a bit like that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.040
 philosophically honestly yes what can 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 In the beginning, this is exactly what you should do 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 whole just when I'm so free now 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.229
 Let me give you a concrete example 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.060
 to pick out topic Amazon 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.650
 book publication and so on 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.950
 a good week ago we lost weight 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.420
 key out there hewn and the rank 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.700
 still very well there and comes completely 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.009
 good at the people and I would have 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 from the beginning only the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.170
 seen possibilities that lie ahead of me 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 so raise a thing like that to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.040
 I would do the whole thing 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 probably never implemented 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.920
 that is always when I try new ones 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.890
 to realize projects 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020
 to do new things then concentrate 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.790
 I do not care so much about what 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 I now in front of me with my naked eye 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.320
 yes, what can be seen somewhere in the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.880
 internet for pages already gives some 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.200
 to report on newspaper articles and so on 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 continue like the current one 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 economic situation and the economy 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.329
 that's all just bullshit of you guys 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 distracts you if you look at that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.300
 focuses what you really achieve 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 want what you want to do 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.410
 which message you have, etc. then sees 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.120
 one on one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.120
 Things you did not even see before 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.570
 that means when accepted how to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 example you apply somewhere in the new one 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.550
 to get job or you're just with 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.800
 finished his studies and so he knew one 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.300
 take place yes then the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.040
 Most recent in the newspaper look 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.900
 and if has to look around everywhere though 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.450
 give something here and so on and so forth 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.820
 What can I do somewhere and one ? 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.850
 from 100 or so or one in a thousand 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.970
 will think about what I have 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.480
 actually for skills in mine 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.340
 Studium develops what I have the five 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.200
 studied or studied even longer 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 how many semesters do I have for this 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.980
 sacrificed how much time I had to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.830
 invest and what I have everything for 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.180
 Skills now being developed 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.340
 abilities with others 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.440
 can help people and this one 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
 human will then ask how can 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.570
 me these talents these skills 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.850
 do not use development anywhere 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.920
 it is in a company or if it is 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.630
 somewhere private is with other people 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 So now, so to speak, on an independent basis 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.410
 base or whatever it is 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 means he will focus on it 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.370
 which skills have which talents 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.010
 I developed and what can I do with it 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.930
 my imagination now there 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.270
 realize 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.910
 He makes a very concrete picture 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.300
 a clear picture of what he achieves 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.970
 wants and that does not matter what you do 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.070
 it is much more effective 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.350
 to concentrate on what yours 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.600
 Ghost looks like what your big eye 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.660
 See why because your mind can 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.620
 everything imagine everything infinite yes 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.050
 because your eye 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.300
 your eyes can only see what 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.040
 now you just saw in front of him to 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.600
 example, only the news or the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.390
 newspaper articles that say 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.770
 There are not enough jobs in Germany 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.330
 fewer and fewer students find one 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.830
 find a conclusion 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.630
 after completing a job and so on 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.520
 on and on and so forth and so on 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.650
 your mind does not care that much 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.049
 if you have the imagination for it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.600
 and then applying it you'll find yourself 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.870
 somewhere a fat villa on the beach 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.910
 see as a millionaire and then if that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.680
 really the wish is your goal then 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.289
 you will automatically with your eyes 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.110
 start to see the possibilities 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.430
 get you there too 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 but if you just stop on his whole 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.130
 experiences and on his whole life 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.770
 what you have lived so far 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.970
 So decisions are based on it 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.380
 everything is on such always a lot 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.870
 harder to explain than in English 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.789
 then it becomes very difficult because you stop 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.380
 not so many with the naked eye 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.360
 possibilities can be seen as if you 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.550
 if you just change things 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.289
 out of thinking thinks of creating possibilities yourself 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.729
 yes and that's how it was with me 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.009
 Amazon and the key 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.289
 I saw what I see 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.910
 it was okay that hits the soest 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.610
 So had hildmann and all of them 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.860
 They have their publishers and so on 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.810
 continue to push up there and they 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.130
 because I do not know what methods 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.259
 bring to first place 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.810
 I do not have everything I can do everything 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.440
 not allow me but I have one 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.570
 fat community on youtube and I have 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.220
 already bought thousands of people 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.080
 written thousands of training plans 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.139
 and thousands of people watch the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.930
 So videos maybe synonymous buy 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.820
 Thousands of people use this e-book though 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.090
 I invite up there and when I mean 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.099
 use the community and the people 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.770
 not secretly helped so to speak 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.840
 the question if they help me now too 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.130
 and that's exactly what worked and that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.190
 but I could not do that by the way 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:52.000
 I just kind of objectively the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.340
 things look anyway and watch a 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.690
 book read okay how can you with amazon 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.639
 somehow become successful or how 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.800
 I think of a publisher as a publisher or something 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.199
 but you just imagine 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.630
 im okay okay what am i good at 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.159
 what are my talents what abilities 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.599
 and how can i get the possibilities 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.449
 created yourself 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.479
 instead of just me to look after 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.710
 the possibilities are already there 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.720
 that 's it for this video see you 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.000
 next time your kolja barghorn 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.530
 and look and by the way if from the 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.750
 keys have not yet got you now 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.320
 is the last opportunity to 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.320
 there and ciao
