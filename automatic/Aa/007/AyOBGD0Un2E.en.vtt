 the Mayan biosphere harbor a great biodiversity with thousands of species that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.839
 are not yet known and biology catalogs 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.759
 however many of these are in danger of extinction 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.270
 the program for the conservation of the jaguar that conserve and bland qualities

 haiti guatemala 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.469
 developed a study to account for the population of these animals for 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.079
 which quotes high-speed cameras to photograph them in their 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.880
 habitat 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.910
 the jaguar is the third largest cat in the world and the largest in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 the study though is to study the jaguars 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.299
 has been found with other species such as the puma concolor the second most

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.480
 as well as the musín otín 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 very similar to the jaguar but smaller 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.640
 I have no issue of the biggest diesel mammal so 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.230
 a herbivore that usually comes 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.620
 near the bodies of water and expresses of the jaguars 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.500
 Farmers in the north of the country kill jaguars many times 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.799
 because these 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.039
 in turn they kill corral animals to feed themselves 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.130
 other species such as tepezcuintle are also threatened because 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.430
 are used as food as well as the pheasant whose plumage 10 also very 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.200
 appreciated since they present sexual same clifford between that females and males 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.940
 the initiative that goes against those countries 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.800
 seeks that the conservation policies of the Mayan biosphere in 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.120
 special of the tiger lagoon park is taken seriously 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.099
 and recognize the value of its conservation 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.769
