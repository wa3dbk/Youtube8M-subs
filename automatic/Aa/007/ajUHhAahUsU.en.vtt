because white not to give me power so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.819 
because white not to give me power so
you<00:00:34.770> put<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.550> blade<00:00:36.260> into<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.500> slot<00:00:37.680> here

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you put in a blade into this slot here

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
you put in a blade into this slot here
it<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:38.969> iron<00:00:39.270> blade<00:00:39.570> /<00:00:40.079> find<00:00:40.290> iron

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it can be an iron blade / find iron

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.299 
it can be an iron blade / find iron
blade<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> die<00:00:42.090> board<00:00:42.450> diamond<00:00:42.870> blade

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
blade and the die board diamond blade

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
blade and the die board diamond blade
and<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> cut<00:00:45.360> blocks<00:00:45.780> into

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and what it will do is cut blocks into

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
and what it will do is cut blocks into
plates<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> block<00:00:48.300> cutting<00:00:48.690> blade

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
plates now the block cutting blade

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
plates now the block cutting blade
cutting<00:00:49.590> tool<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> softer<00:00:50.579> than<00:00:50.610> iron<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
cutting tool is softer than iron so it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.990 
cutting tool is softer than iron so it
won't<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.600> iron<00:00:51.809> itself<00:00:53.300> find<00:00:54.300> iron<00:00:56.000> block

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
won't do iron itself find iron block

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
won't do iron itself find iron block
will<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.480> materials<00:00:58.289> softer<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:58.770> find<00:00:59.129> iron

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
will do materials softer than find iron

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.910 
will do materials softer than find iron
and<00:01:00.230> diamond<00:01:01.230> block<00:01:01.410> would<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:02.239> until<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
and diamond block would do until is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
and diamond block would do until is
softer<00:01:04.920> than<00:01:04.949> diamond<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.869> need

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
softer than diamond on do you just need

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.240 
softer than diamond on do you just need
to<00:01:07.140> check<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> work<00:01:09.240> behind<00:01:09.720> block

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.610 

yeah<00:01:14.880> you'll<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.300> big<00:01:16.670> !<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.020> block

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
yeah you'll get a big ! if the block

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.920 
yeah you'll get a big ! if the block
that<00:01:19.860> you're<00:01:20.010> cutting<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> too<00:01:20.940> strong<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that you're cutting is too strong for

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.490 
that you're cutting is too strong for
the<00:01:22.440> cutting<00:01:23.040> blade<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.720> paid<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.140> 59

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the cutting blade so we paid over 59

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.070 
the cutting blade so we paid over 59
blade<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.010> there<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:27.030> start<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:29.060> cut<00:01:30.080> it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
blade in there it will start to cut it

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.370 
blade in there it will start to cut it
into<00:01:31.290> pieces<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.580> block<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> iron<00:01:33.690> will

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
into pieces now a block of iron will

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
into pieces now a block of iron will
cost<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.250> nine<00:01:35.640> ingots<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.330> make<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> block

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
cost you nine ingots to make the block

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
cost you nine ingots to make the block
cutting<00:01:39.180> machine<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.660> take<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.200> those

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
cutting machine will take that those

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.070 
cutting machine will take that those
nine<00:01:40.860> ingots<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> turn<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.210> 12<00:01:42.660> plates

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
nine ingots and turn it into 12 plates

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.690 
nine ingots and turn it into 12 plates
so<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.740> saving<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.460> plates<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.520> quite

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so it's saving on plates so that's quite

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
so it's saving on plates so that's quite
a<00:01:47.790> nice<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.270> tool<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.080> very<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.440> for<00:01:49.500> if

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
a nice little tool it's very good for if

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.820 
a nice little tool it's very good for if
you<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.119> plates<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:52.380> something

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
you need a lot of plates for something

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.520 
you need a lot of plates for something
for<00:01:53.130> anything<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:55.820> which<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.290> do

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
for anything really which you can do

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.529 
for anything really which you can do
that<00:01:58.710> stuff<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.430> metal<00:01:59.700> form<00:01:59.970> obviously

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
that stuff in the metal form obviously

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.410 
that stuff in the metal form obviously
but<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:02.520> quite<00:02:02.729> nice<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> dedicated

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
but it's quite nice to have a dedicated

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.930 
but it's quite nice to have a dedicated
machine<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.350> does<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.580> bit<00:02:05.789> more

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
machine that does it a little bit more

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.650 
machine that does it a little bit more
efficiently<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> other<00:02:09.060> thing<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
efficiently the other thing that I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
efficiently the other thing that I
should<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.050> very<00:02:10.649> quickly<00:02:10.920> note<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
should just very quickly note is that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
should just very quickly note is that
the<00:02:12.030> induction<00:02:12.330> furnace<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:12.900> has<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:13.230> great

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the induction furnace now has up great

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.150 
the induction furnace now has up great
slots<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:14.370> actually<00:02:14.940> only<00:02:15.620> there<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.770> also

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
slots that's actually only there is also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.330 
slots that's actually only there is also
another<00:02:17.640> item<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.500> sure<00:02:19.830> what<00:02:20.190> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
another item which are not sure what it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.039 
another item which are not sure what it
does<00:02:20.549> i<00:02:20.580> had<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> bit<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.180> play<00:02:21.450> around<00:02:21.810> with

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
does i had a bit of a play around with

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.470 
does i had a bit of a play around with
then<00:02:22.170> didn't<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.769> do<00:02:23.070> anything<00:02:23.480> it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
then didn't think to do anything it's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.280 
then didn't think to do anything it's
called<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> solar<00:02:25.140> distiller<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:28.140> got
