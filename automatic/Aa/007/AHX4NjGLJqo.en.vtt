what's up YouTube Daniel karma here for
a<00:00:08.840> quick<00:00:09.050> video<00:00:09.350> tutorial<00:00:10.340> and<00:00:11.030> showcase<00:00:11.510> of

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
a quick video tutorial and showcase of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.089 
a quick video tutorial and showcase of
my<00:00:12.190> one<00:00:13.190> block<00:00:13.490> thick<00:00:14.230> extremely<00:00:15.230> compact<00:00:15.740> bud

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
my one block thick extremely compact bud

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.730 
my one block thick extremely compact bud
switch<00:00:16.720> this<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.900> exactly<00:00:18.080> what<00:00:18.470> it<00:00:18.500> looks

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
switch this is exactly what it looks

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.269 
switch this is exactly what it looks
like<00:00:19.000> five<00:00:20.000> blocks<00:00:20.240> tall<00:00:20.650> three<00:00:21.650> blocks<00:00:21.980> wide

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
like five blocks tall three blocks wide

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.540 
like five blocks tall three blocks wide
one<00:00:23.180> block<00:00:23.449> thick<00:00:23.810> takes<00:00:24.650> up<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.980> total<00:00:25.369> of

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
one block thick takes up a total of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.990 
one block thick takes up a total of
fifteen<00:00:26.300> cubic<00:00:26.869> blocks<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:27.560> that's<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
fifteen cubic blocks and that's the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.259 
fifteen cubic blocks and that's the
dimensions<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.720> it<00:00:29.900> 15<00:00:30.710> blocks<00:00:31.269> small

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
dimensions of it 15 blocks small

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.390 
dimensions of it 15 blocks small
compared<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.809> most<00:00:33.110> bud<00:00:33.500> switches<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.220> I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
compared to most bud switches and I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400 
compared to most bud switches and I
think<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:34.790> may<00:00:35.150> be<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.540> most<00:00:35.570> compact<00:00:36.170> that

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
think this may be the most compact that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.820 
think this may be the most compact that
I've<00:00:36.530> ever<00:00:36.710> seen<00:00:37.960> also<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.229> can<00:00:39.409> fit<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.739> a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
I've ever seen also it can fit in a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.320 
I've ever seen also it can fit in a
three-block<00:00:40.129> thick<00:00:40.580> wall<00:00:40.850> which<00:00:41.089> is<00:00:41.210> an

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
three-block thick wall which is an

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.840 
three-block thick wall which is an
advantage<00:00:41.420> having<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:42.350> block<00:00:42.589> thick<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
advantage having it one block thick the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.789 
advantage having it one block thick the
output<00:00:44.449> is<00:00:44.659> taken<00:00:45.530> from<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.820> block<00:00:47.479> here<00:00:47.930> so

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
output is taken from this block here so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.759 
output is taken from this block here so
if<00:00:48.979> you<00:00:49.010> put<00:00:49.460> blocks<00:00:50.150> like<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:50.449> in<00:00:50.989> any

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
if you put blocks like this in any

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.689 
if you put blocks like this in any
direction<00:00:53.080> they<00:00:54.080> will<00:00:54.320> all<00:00:54.500> draw<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.010> same

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
direction they will all draw the same

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.820 
direction they will all draw the same
output<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.479> can<00:00:56.659> draw<00:00:56.900> it<00:00:56.930> with<00:00:57.199> just<00:00:57.530> plain

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
output you can draw it with just plain

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.729 
output you can draw it with just plain
redstone<00:00:58.400> wire<00:00:58.670> and<00:01:00.790> this<00:01:02.199> piston<00:01:03.199> over<00:01:03.439> here

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
redstone wire and this piston over here

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.550 
redstone wire and this piston over here
is<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.879> block<00:01:05.239> update<00:01:05.689> piston<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:06.470> you

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
is the block update piston so if you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560 
is the block update piston so if you
update<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.520> block<00:01:07.729> next<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.390> will

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
update the block next to it that will

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.780 
update the block next to it that will
flash<00:01:09.070> if<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:11.660> put<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.170> bigger<00:01:13.100> delay<00:01:13.490> on<00:01:13.670> this

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
flash if you put a bigger delay on this

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.020 
flash if you put a bigger delay on this
repeater<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.510> can<00:01:14.660> actually<00:01:14.960> control<00:01:16.030> you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
repeater you can actually control you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.410 
repeater you can actually control you
can<00:01:17.180> actually<00:01:17.450> control<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.490> delay<00:01:19.490> or<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
can actually control the delay or the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.500 
can actually control the delay or the
time<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.470> pulse<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.880> like<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.480> the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
time of the pulse but I like it on the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.700 
time of the pulse but I like it on the
lowest<00:01:23.810> setting<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.700> has<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:26.320> block<00:01:27.320> update

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
lowest setting it has this block update

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.570 
lowest setting it has this block update
detector<00:01:28.250> has<00:01:28.760> one<00:01:29.300> two<00:01:30.640> three<00:01:31.780> four<00:01:32.780> five

open<00:01:34.580> sides<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.270> piston<00:01:35.810> which<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:37.060> I

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
open sides of the piston which is as I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.610 
open sides of the piston which is as I
think<00:01:38.330> as<00:01:38.450> far<00:01:38.480> as<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.900> can<00:01:39.020> get<00:01:39.230> because<00:01:39.380> we

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
think as far as you can get because we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.960 
think as far as you can get because we
always<00:01:39.830> one<00:01:40.159> side<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.460> going<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.640> be<00:01:40.700> covered

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
always one side is going to be covered

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.120 
always one side is going to be covered
by<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.150> block<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:43.720> one<00:01:44.720> block<00:01:45.080> one<00:01:45.380> side<00:01:45.860> is

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
by the block and one block one side is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.750 
by the block and one block one side is
inside<00:01:46.730> of<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.170> but<00:01:48.170> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.440> build<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.250> farm

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
inside of it but if you build a farm

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.930 
inside of it but if you build a farm
through<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.510> like<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> pumpkin<00:01:51.530> farm<00:01:51.940> imagine

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
through it like a pumpkin farm imagine

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.910 
through it like a pumpkin farm imagine
dirt<00:01:53.450> over<00:01:53.870> here<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:56.320> melon<00:01:57.320> stem

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
dirt over here and then a melon stem

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.180 
dirt over here and then a melon stem
over<00:01:58.190> here<00:01:59.200> Mort<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.350> mean<00:02:00.590> till<00:02:00.800> dirt<00:02:00.979> over

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
over here Mort I mean till dirt over

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.920 
over here Mort I mean till dirt over
here<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.490> melons<00:02:01.760> time<00:02:01.880> over<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:02.299> the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
here and the melons time over here the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.080 
here and the melons time over here the
melon<00:02:03.260> will<00:02:03.380> grow<00:02:03.620> in<00:02:03.770> here<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.909> does

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
melon will grow in here and so it does

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.850 
melon will grow in here and so it does
not<00:02:05.120> render<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.960> face<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.560> piston

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
not render this face of the piston

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.770 
not render this face of the piston
useless<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.149> now<00:02:08.330> I'm<00:02:08.390> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.569> show<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:08.720> how

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
useless so now I'm going to show you how

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.289 
useless so now I'm going to show you how
to<00:02:08.869> build<00:02:09.049> it<00:02:09.429> I'm<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.849> build<00:02:11.120> out

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
to build it I'm just going to build out

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.620 
to build it I'm just going to build out
a<00:02:11.330> little<00:02:11.569> bit<00:02:11.690> from<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:13.120> first<00:02:14.120> step<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.600> to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
a little bit from here first step is to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.559 
a little bit from here first step is to
put<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.990> downward<00:02:15.620> facing<00:02:15.830> sticky<00:02:16.459> piston<00:02:16.880> with

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
put a downward facing sticky piston with

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.120 
put a downward facing sticky piston with
an<00:02:17.750> opaque<00:02:18.080> block

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
an opaque block

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.270 
an opaque block
on<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.370> face<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.770> did<00:02:22.010> over<00:02:22.220> here

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
on the face of it as as I did over here

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.020 
on the face of it as as I did over here
now<00:02:23.120> come<00:02:23.360> down<00:02:23.510> 12<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> cross<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.160> break

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
now come down 12 and a cross and break

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.240 
now come down 12 and a cross and break
these<00:02:26.210> two<00:02:26.480> last<00:02:26.690> blocks<00:02:27.020> put<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> redstone

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
these two last blocks put a redstone

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.400 
these two last blocks put a redstone
torch<00:02:28.490> here<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.750> side<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:29.990> this<00:02:30.170> block

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
torch here on the side of this block

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.610 
torch here on the side of this block
that<00:02:31.130> would<00:02:31.310> go<00:02:31.550> near<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.240> piston<00:02:32.660> put<00:02:33.440> a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that would go near to the piston put a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.310 
that would go near to the piston put a
repeater<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.250> top<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> block<00:02:35.180> then<00:02:36.020> in

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
repeater on top of the block then in

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.500 
repeater on top of the block then in
front<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> repeater<00:02:37.130> put<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.880> block<00:02:38.180> with<00:02:38.480> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
front of the repeater put a block with a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.930 
front of the repeater put a block with a
redstone<00:02:38.930> torch<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.440> top<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.280> top<00:02:40.640> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
redstone torch on top of that on top of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.360 
redstone torch on top of that on top of
that<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.330> put<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.690> block<00:02:41.960> with<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.370> with

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
that you put a block with a with

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.820 
that you put a block with a with
redstone<00:02:44.060> dust<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.230> side<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
redstone dust and on the side of the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.960 
redstone dust and on the side of the
dust<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.760> put<00:02:46.970> your<00:02:47.210> block<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.050> that's<00:02:48.380> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
dust you put your block and that's it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.630 
dust you put your block and that's it
here<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.810> very<00:02:51.740> compact<00:02:52.280> bud

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
here you have the very compact bud

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.150 
here you have the very compact bud
switch<00:02:52.850> um<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.560> cannot<00:02:54.950> actually<00:02:56.560> put<00:02:57.560> change

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
switch um you cannot actually put change

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.520 
switch um you cannot actually put change
this<00:02:58.310> repeater<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.970> wire<00:02:59.270> or<00:02:59.630> else<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.410> get

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
this repeater with wire or else you get

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.330 
this repeater with wire or else you get
this<00:03:00.890> flashy<00:03:01.850> thingy<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.600> then<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:04.010> burns<00:03:04.190> out

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
this flashy thingy and then it burns out

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.450 
this flashy thingy and then it burns out
the<00:03:04.400> torch<00:03:04.760> over<00:03:04.970> here<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:06.230> don't<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.250> it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
the torch over here so don't do that it

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.430 
the torch over here so don't do that it
needs<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> repeater<00:03:08.390> but<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.110> delay<00:03:09.410> of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
needs to be a repeater but the delay of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.080 
needs to be a repeater but the delay of
the<00:03:09.560> repeater<00:03:09.920> will<00:03:10.190> always<00:03:10.520> work<00:03:10.790> doesn't

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
the repeater will always work doesn't

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.120 
the repeater will always work doesn't
matter<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.480> delay<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.290> bud<00:03:12.560> switch<00:03:12.740> will

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
matter the delay this bud switch will

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.460 
matter the delay this bud switch will
work<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.510> delay<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.020> personal

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
work but the delay is just personal

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.990 
work but the delay is just personal
