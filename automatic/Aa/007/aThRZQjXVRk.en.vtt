leaked a whole lot of oil out so I was

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.070 
leaked a whole lot of oil out so I was
chasing<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:27.009> leak<00:00:27.460> down<00:00:27.730> from<00:00:28.449> starting<00:00:28.900> pond

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.679 
chasing the leak down from starting pond
underneath<00:00:29.349> where<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.099> saw<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.420> oil

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
underneath where I saw the the the oil

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.320 
underneath where I saw the the the oil
slick<00:00:32.169> on<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:32.410> ground<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:33.699> chase<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.239> up

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
slick on the ground and I chase it up

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.369 
slick on the ground and I chase it up
with<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.480> flashlight

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
with a flashlight

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.310 
with a flashlight
wound<00:00:36.250> up<00:00:36.430> popping<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.090> hood<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:38.170> then

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
wound up popping the hood and then

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.619 
wound up popping the hood and then
looking<00:00:38.559> up<00:00:38.800> here<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.370> I<00:00:39.820> thought<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.420> maybe

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
looking up here and I thought that maybe

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.210 
looking up here and I thought that maybe
the<00:00:40.900> gasket<00:00:41.470> for<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.250> distributor<00:00:42.850> had<00:00:43.720> gone

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
the gasket for the distributor had gone

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.640 
the gasket for the distributor had gone
but<00:00:45.220> on<00:00:45.400> today<00:00:46.059> after<00:00:46.720> I<00:00:46.750> got<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:47.019> better<00:00:47.530> look

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
but on today after I got a better look

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.460 
but on today after I got a better look
at<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.430> I<00:00:49.360> found<00:00:49.629> out<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.199> it<00:00:50.350> was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
at it and I found out that it was

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.200 
at it and I found out that it was
actually<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:52.049> oil<00:00:53.159> pressure<00:00:54.159> sending<00:00:55.030> unit

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
actually the oil pressure sending unit

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.000 
actually the oil pressure sending unit
had<00:00:56.140> gone<00:00:56.379> bad

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
had gone bad

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.009 
had gone bad
now<00:00:57.460> hopefully<00:00:57.670> that's<00:00:58.119> the<00:00:58.299> only<00:00:58.540> problem

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
now hopefully that's the only problem

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.369 
now hopefully that's the only problem
the<00:00:59.710> gasket<00:01:00.330> for<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.479> distributor<00:01:01.869> still<00:01:02.199> may

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
the gasket for the distributor still may

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.929 
the gasket for the distributor still may
need<00:01:03.040> replacing

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
need replacing

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.929 
need replacing
I<00:01:03.970> don't<00:01:04.449> know<00:01:04.629> but<00:01:05.590> today<00:01:05.920> I'm<00:01:06.280> going<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.670> show

you how to swap out your old oil

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940 
you how to swap out your old oil
pressure<00:01:10.720> sending<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.350> didn't<00:01:11.560> put<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.799> new

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
pressure sending you didn't put a new

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.789 
pressure sending you didn't put a new
one<00:01:12.159> in<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.799> what<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.159> picked<00:01:19.000> up<00:01:19.210> today

get<00:01:36.460> myself<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:37.149> special<00:01:37.539> socket<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.079> remove

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
get myself a special socket to remove

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.770 
get myself a special socket to remove
this<00:01:38.560> thing<00:01:38.859> right<00:01:39.100> here<00:01:39.210> deep<00:01:40.210> sockets<00:01:40.749> that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
this thing right here deep sockets that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.980 
this thing right here deep sockets that
I<00:01:40.929> got<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.289> my<00:01:41.380> tool<00:01:41.619> case<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:43.780> big

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
I got in my tool case they're not big

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.679 
I got in my tool case they're not big
enough<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.469> they<00:01:44.770> are<00:01:44.799> not<00:01:45.009> deep<00:01:45.219> enough<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.630> I

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
enough and they are not deep enough so I

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.389 
enough and they are not deep enough so I
had<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.899> go<00:01:47.020> buy<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.289> special<00:01:47.679> socket

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
had to go buy the special socket

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.300 
had to go buy the special socket
designed<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.899> remove<00:01:50.170> these<00:01:50.439> guys<00:01:50.740> right<00:01:51.039> here

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
designed to remove these guys right here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.359 
designed to remove these guys right here
so<00:01:51.609> that<00:01:52.210> cost<00:01:52.659> me<00:01:52.869> about<00:01:53.140> thirteen<00:01:53.890> dollars

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
so that cost me about thirteen dollars

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.450 
so that cost me about thirteen dollars
one-time<00:01:54.969> use<00:01:55.539> don't<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.259> but<00:01:56.859> it<00:01:57.280> is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
one-time use don't like that but it is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.840 
one-time use don't like that but it is
what<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.729> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
what it is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.639 
what it is
alright<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.030> let's<00:02:01.240> take<00:02:01.929> a<00:02:01.960> look<00:02:02.200> here<00:02:02.439> I

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
alright so let's take a look here I

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.459 
alright so let's take a look here I
disconnected<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.609> positive<00:02:04.179> all<00:02:04.420> term<00:02:05.259> rule

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
disconnected the positive all term rule

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.070 
disconnected the positive all term rule
from<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.710> battery<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.719> if<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> hats

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
from a battery I don't know if the hats

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.740 
from a battery I don't know if the hats
or<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:08.470> but<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.679> did<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.789> now<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:10.569> going<00:02:10.660> to

or not but I did and now I'm going to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.559 
or not but I did and now I'm going to
shine<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.080> light<00:02:11.110> down<00:02:11.500> here<00:02:12.300> I'll<00:02:13.300> show<00:02:13.540> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
shine the light down here I'll show you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.890 
shine the light down here I'll show you
what<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.870> found

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
what I found

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.309 
what I found
all<00:02:14.989> right<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:16.780> right<00:02:17.780> there

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
all right that right there

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.680 
all right that right there
that<00:02:18.500> rubber<00:02:18.739> bootie<00:02:20.319> keeps<00:02:21.319> water<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.690> dirt

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
that rubber bootie keeps water and dirt

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.399 
that rubber bootie keeps water and dirt
now<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.680> oil<00:02:24.920> sending<00:02:25.790> unit<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.379> assume<00:02:27.379> that

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
now the oil sending unit I assume that

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.000 
now the oil sending unit I assume that
that's<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:28.040> sensor<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.840> connected<00:02:30.830> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that's the sensor that is connected to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's the sensor that is connected to
the<00:02:31.310> gauge<00:02:31.599> inside<00:02:32.599> on<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.019> dashboard<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
the gauge inside on a dashboard that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520 
the gauge inside on a dashboard that
tells<00:02:34.730> me<00:02:34.879> what<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:35.090> fuel<00:02:35.480> pressure<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.170> all

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
tells me what my fuel pressure is all

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.250 
tells me what my fuel pressure is all
right<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.489> rubber<00:02:37.790> bootie<00:02:38.120> up<00:02:38.239> top<00:02:41.260> it's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260

how the oil came up through it that's
not<00:03:29.419> supposed<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.959> happen<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:31.400> happened

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
all right so here's the here's the old

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.630 
all right so here's the here's the old
unit<00:03:51.490> right<00:03:51.670> here<00:03:52.860> there's<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.070> top<00:03:54.340> where<00:03:54.610> I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
unit right here there's the top where I

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.330 
unit right here there's the top where I
had<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.030> plug<00:03:55.740> try<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.800> get<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:56.980> light<00:03:57.190> in

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
had that plug try to get the light in

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.270 
had that plug try to get the light in
there<00:03:57.490> hopefully<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:57.970> will<00:03:58.060> focus<00:03:58.300> right

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
there hopefully this will focus right
