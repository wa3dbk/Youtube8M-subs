00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
and the helicopters you take down so i'm

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.009 
and the helicopters you take down so i'm

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
guessing to you have to buy like

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.099 
guessing to you have to buy like
launchers<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.709> stuff<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.639> that<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:17.109> who

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
launchers and stuff like that like who

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.539 
launchers and stuff like that like who
uses<00:03:18.319> rocket<00:03:18.709> launches<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.069> zombies<00:03:19.370> so

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
uses rocket launches of zombies so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.090 
uses rocket launches of zombies so
they're<00:03:19.730> totally<00:03:20.030> changing<00:03:20.829> zombies<00:03:21.829> i<00:03:21.950> don't

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
they're totally changing zombies i don't

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
it will never be as good as zombies

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.559 
it will never be as good as zombies
because<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:51.919> zombies<00:03:52.459> inspired<00:03:53.120> game

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
and nothing is going to be as good as

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.789 
and nothing is going to be as good as
the<00:03:55.459> original<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.910> my<00:03:56.060> opinion<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.799> we'll

thing that upset me they're going to be

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.060 
thing that upset me they're going to be
adding<00:05:15.790> sway<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:17.080> sniper<00:05:17.380> rifles<00:05:17.830> in

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
adding sway to sniper rifles in

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.440 
adding sway to sniper rifles in
battlefield<00:05:18.760> like<00:05:19.210> click<00:05:19.900> or<00:05:20.710> hold<00:05:21.220> LS<00:05:22.000> to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
battlefield like click or hold LS to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.420 
battlefield like click or hold LS to
hold<00:05:22.960> your<00:05:23.110> breath<00:05:23.410> or<00:05:23.590> whatever<00:05:23.830> like

hold your breath or whatever like

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.250 
hold your breath or whatever like
honestly<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:25.300> ruins<00:05:25.600> sniping<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.139> my

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
honestly that ruins sniping in my

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.200 
honestly that ruins sniping in my
opinion<00:05:26.560> yeah<00:05:27.220> they<00:05:27.460> said<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.760> they<00:05:27.910> get<00:05:28.090> it

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
opinion yeah they said that they get it

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.000 
opinion yeah they said that they get it
to<00:05:28.240> counteract<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.200> whole<00:05:29.380> quickscoping

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
to counteract the whole quickscoping

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.130 
to counteract the whole quickscoping
mechanic<00:05:30.490> honestly<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.479> would<00:05:31.750> rather<00:05:31.870> be

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
mechanic honestly I would rather be

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.240 
mechanic honestly I would rather be
stuck<00:05:32.380> in<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.620> match<00:05:32.770> where<00:05:32.950> everyone's

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
stuck in a match where everyone's

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.990 
stuck in a match where everyone's
quickscoping<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.860> still<00:05:35.860> have<00:05:36.070> that<00:05:36.460> steady

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
quickscoping and still have that steady

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.960 
quickscoping and still have that steady
aim<00:05:37.270> because<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.830> sway<00:05:39.160> is<00:05:39.430> just<00:05:39.729> not

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
aim because it's the sway is just not

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.909 
aim because it's the sway is just not
realistic<00:05:40.270> at<00:05:40.539> all<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.020> in<00:05:41.560> my<00:05:41.830> opinion

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
realistic at all and in my opinion

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.850 
realistic at all and in my opinion
ruined<00:05:42.640> sniping<00:05:43.060> entirely<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:44.560> other<00:05:44.710> thing

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
ruined sniping entirely the other thing

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.200 
ruined sniping entirely the other thing
i<00:05:44.919> want<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.130> touch<00:05:45.340> on<00:05:45.520> is<00:05:45.729> that<00:05:45.880> they're

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
i want to touch on is that they're

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.000 
i want to touch on is that they're
marrying<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.140> assault<00:05:47.500> class<00:05:47.680> with<00:05:47.919> the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
marrying the assault class with the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.469 
marrying the assault class with the
medic<00:05:48.280> class<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.490> minute<00:05:48.850> class<00:05:49.030> isn't<00:05:49.360> gonna

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
medic class a minute class isn't gonna

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.600 
medic class a minute class isn't gonna
make<00:05:49.630> its<00:05:49.810> appearance<00:05:49.979> it's<00:05:50.979> going<00:05:51.310> to<00:05:51.430> take

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
make its appearance it's going to take

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.080 
make its appearance it's going to take
place<00:05:52.390> as<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:54.010> assault<00:05:54.400> class<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.850> assault

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
class is actually going to be the ones

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.450 
class is actually going to be the ones
are<00:05:57.190> with<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.810> medic<00:05:58.810> kits<00:05:59.050> now<00:05:59.289> because<00:06:00.100> they

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
are with the medic kits now because they

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.770

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
said that they're on the front lines and

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.270 
said that they're on the front lines and
they<00:06:01.930> should<00:06:02.110> be<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.530> ones<00:06:02.560> who<00:06:02.860> healing

they should be the ones who healing

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.750 
they should be the ones who healing
everyone<00:06:03.580> so<00:06:04.560> medic<00:06:05.560> class<00:06:05.710> is<00:06:06.039> going<00:06:06.160> to<00:06:06.250> be<00:06:06.430> a

everyone so medic class is going to be a

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.250 
everyone so medic class is going to be a
little<00:06:07.120> different<00:06:07.330> it's<00:06:07.690> going<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:07.930> be<00:06:08.080> called

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
little different it's going to be called

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.100 
little different it's going to be called
the<00:06:09.000> suppressor<00:06:10.000> class<00:06:10.240> there's<00:06:10.960> something

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
the suppressor class there's something

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.190 
the suppressor class there's something
like<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.440> and<00:06:12.120> they're<00:06:13.120> basically<00:06:13.930> going<00:06:14.139> to

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
like that and they're basically going to

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.070 
like that and they're basically going to

the salt and the medic classes have

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.100 
the salt and the medic classes have
basically<00:06:22.930> swapped<00:06:23.440> their<00:06:23.650> abilities<00:06:24.100> but

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110
