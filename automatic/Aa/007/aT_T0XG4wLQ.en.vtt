all<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:01.949> today<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:03.090> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.810> try<00:00:04.470> to

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
all right today I'm going to try to

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.419 
all right today I'm going to try to
explain<00:00:04.710> how<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.670> made<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> bell<00:00:06.839> siphon<00:00:07.429> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
explain how I made a bell siphon that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.790 
explain how I made a bell siphon that
will<00:00:08.760> automatically<00:00:09.599> site<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.710> will

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
will automatically site that will

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.419 
will automatically site that will
automatically<00:00:11.370> cycle<00:00:13.130> certainly<00:00:14.130> not<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
automatically cycle certainly not the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
automatically cycle certainly not the
only<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.059> doing<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> way

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
only way of doing it but it's the way

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.400 
only way of doing it but it's the way
that<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.650> found<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.100> will<00:00:17.460> work<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.930> key<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that I found that will work the key to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.140 
that I found that will work the key to
my<00:00:20.310> process<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.960> device<00:00:22.320> here

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
my process is this little device here

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.779 
my process is this little device here
you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.330> find<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:25.019> Home<00:00:25.199> Depot<00:00:25.789> it's

you can find this at Home Depot it's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
you can find this at Home Depot it's
called<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.510> kitchen<00:00:27.960> spray<00:00:28.650> hose<00:00:29.010> guide<00:00:30.439> as<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
called a kitchen spray hose guide as you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.380 
called a kitchen spray hose guide as you
can<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.460> fairly<00:00:32.940> simple<00:00:34.370> little

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
can see it's a fairly simple little

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.910 
can see it's a fairly simple little
fixture<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> did<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.850> took<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
fixture and what I did was I took this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
fixture and what I did was I took this
hole<00:00:40.920> saw<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.180> hole<00:00:42.360> saw<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
hole saw which is the hole saw that you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.940 
hole saw which is the hole saw that you
would<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.980> install<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.270> lock<00:00:45.840> set<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
would use to install a lock set on a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
would use to install a lock set on a
door<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.140> part<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> goes<00:00:50.629> in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
door and this is the part that goes in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
door and this is the part that goes in
the<00:00:51.840> edge<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> door<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.910> actual

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the edge of the door for the actual

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.779 
the edge of the door for the actual
locking<00:00:55.379> mechanism<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.329> see

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
locking mechanism and as you can see

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.240 
locking mechanism and as you can see
it'll<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.120> nearly<00:01:00.629> create<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> hole<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it'll pretty nearly create a hole that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.969 
it'll pretty nearly create a hole that
is<00:01:02.390> perfect<00:01:03.390> size<00:01:03.799> to<00:01:04.799> install<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:06.299> device

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
is perfect size to install this device

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
is perfect size to install this device
once<00:01:07.979> you've<00:01:08.159> got<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> hole<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
once you've got the hole you put it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440 
once you've got the hole you put it
inside<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> hole<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.150> bottom

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
inside the hole like that on the bottom

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
inside the hole like that on the bottom
side<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:14.369> simply<00:01:15.740> tighten<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:18.080> like<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
side you simply tighten it up like that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.149 
side you simply tighten it up like that
and<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.220> won't<00:01:20.430> leak<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.320> then<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and it won't leak and then what you have

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.910 
and it won't leak and then what you have
to<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> put<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.229> 90<00:01:25.650> degree

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
to do is you have to put a 90 degree

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
to do is you have to put a 90 degree
elbow<00:01:26.840> like<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.670> does<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
elbow like that and what that does is it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.450 
elbow like that and what that does is it
slows<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> water<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.280> gives

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
slows the water down so that it gives

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.109 
slows the water down so that it gives
the<00:01:32.670> siphon<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.570> engage<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> once<00:01:35.939> you've

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the siphon time to engage so once you've

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
the siphon time to engage so once you've
got<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:38.360> planning<00:01:39.360> bed<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
got that in your planning bed you can

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
got that in your planning bed you can
then<00:01:41.430> install<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:43.520> drain<00:01:44.520> pipe<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> stand

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
then install a drain pipe or a stand

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
then install a drain pipe or a stand
pipe<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> whatever<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> call

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
pipe with it whatever you want to call

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
pipe with it whatever you want to call
it<00:01:48.439> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.290> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it this is one like this it's a it's a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.789 
it this is one like this it's a it's a
one-inch<00:01:52.680> pipe<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:54.049> this<00:01:55.049> particular<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
one-inch pipe and this particular one is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.130 
one-inch pipe and this particular one is

about seven inches long and then over
this<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.689> install<00:02:04.939> your

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
this you would actually install your

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.360 
this you would actually install your
bell<00:02:07.079> siphon<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.740> siphon<00:02:08.280> pipe<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.619> what

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.479 
water to come in by the bottom and then
you've<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.660> tube<00:02:26.019> here<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
you've got this little tube here that

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.410 
you've got this little tube here that
enables<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.390> break<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.290> siphon<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.180> that

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
enables you to break the siphon so that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.589 
enables you to break the siphon so that
your<00:02:31.780> bell<00:02:32.560> siphon<00:02:32.769> will<00:02:33.599> automatically

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
your bell siphon will automatically

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.370 
your bell siphon will automatically
cycle<00:02:37.080> gonna<00:02:38.080> need<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.400> 3/8<00:02:39.400> inch<00:02:39.580> drill

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
cycle gonna need a 3/8 inch drill

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.240 
cycle gonna need a 3/8 inch drill
because<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:42.239> 3/8<00:02:43.239> inch<00:02:43.420> pipe<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:45.220> a

because this is a 3/8 inch pipe with a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.000 
because this is a 3/8 inch pipe with a
quarter<00:02:45.940> inch<00:02:45.970> opening<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:47.650> course<00:02:47.830> is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
quarter inch opening and of course is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.380 
quarter inch opening and of course is
zip<00:02:48.190> tie<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.260> that's<00:02:50.260> how<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.890> build<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.390> so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
zip tie so that's how you build it so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:06.620 
zip tie so that's how you build it so
now<00:02:52.660> let's<00:02:53.290> see<00:02:53.410> how<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.650> works

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.610 

as<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.440> can<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.890> we've<00:03:08.610> already<00:03:08.820> got<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
as you can see we've already got the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.040 
as you can see we've already got the
drain<00:03:10.620> pipe<00:03:10.890> install<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.560> I'll<00:03:13.680> drop<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
drain pipe install so I'll drop the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.960 
drain pipe install so I'll drop the
siphon<00:03:16.050> pipe<00:03:16.230> down<00:03:16.500> over<00:03:16.680> at<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> top<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.500> now

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
siphon pipe down over at the top and now

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:53.780 
siphon pipe down over at the top and now
I'll<00:03:20.970> simply<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:22.440> that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.860 

and<00:03:54.790> what<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.090> want<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.300> look<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:58.030> as<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
and what you want to look for is as the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.979 
and what you want to look for is as the
the<00:03:59.470> water<00:03:59.709> rises<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.550> see<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.420> mark<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
the water rises you see the mark on the

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.760 
the water rises you see the mark on the
siphon<00:04:02.410> tube<00:04:03.150> I'm<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> siphon<00:04:04.600> pipe<00:04:04.780> when<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
siphon tube I'm a siphon pipe when the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.680 
siphon tube I'm a siphon pipe when the
water<00:04:05.980> level<00:04:06.340> gets<00:04:06.550> about<00:04:06.850> there<00:04:07.150> you'll

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
water level gets about there you'll

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.300 
water level gets about there you'll
start<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:08.140> hear<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.739> siphon<00:04:09.160> engage<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:12.130> can

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
start to hear the siphon engage you can

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.530 
start to hear the siphon engage you can
get<00:04:12.430> water<00:04:12.640> dripping<00:04:12.940> now<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:14.230> now<00:04:15.389> water<00:04:16.389> is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
get water dripping now and now water is

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.259 
get water dripping now and now water is
actually<00:04:17.100> coming<00:04:18.100> out<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.519> what<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.940> bottom

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
actually coming out to what the bottom

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.850 
actually coming out to what the bottom
is<00:04:19.389> being<00:04:19.600> returned<00:04:19.989> for<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.320> reservoir<00:04:23.910> so

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
is being returned for the reservoir so

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.040 
is being returned for the reservoir so
you<00:04:26.860> come<00:04:27.070> back<00:04:27.100> here<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:29.380> can<00:04:29.530> see<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.100> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
you come back here you can see that the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.010 
you come back here you can see that the
at<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.200> water<00:04:32.440> level<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.950> now<00:04:33.100> dropping<00:04:37.020> let

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
at the water level is now dropping let

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.579 
at the water level is now dropping let
this<00:04:38.139> drop<00:04:38.410> down<00:04:39.960> until<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:44.589 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.589 

vacuum<00:04:45.429> is<00:04:45.519> broken<00:04:45.939> and<00:04:46.119> the<00:04:46.179> siphon

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
vacuum is broken and the siphon

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.509 
vacuum is broken and the siphon
disengages<00:04:49.799> what<00:04:50.799> her<00:04:50.919> level<00:04:51.189> will<00:04:51.279> have<00:04:51.429> to

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:51.519 
disengages what her level will have to

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:57.659 
disengages what her level will have to
go<00:04:51.669> down<00:04:51.849> just<00:04:52.349> below<00:04:54.269> what<00:04:55.269> zipped<00:04:55.599> is<00:04:56.669> which

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
go down just below what zipped is which

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.739 
go down just below what zipped is which
would<00:04:57.849> be<00:04:57.969> the<00:04:58.119> end<00:04:58.329> of<00:04:58.689> the<00:05:00.089> 3/8<00:05:01.089> inch<00:05:01.389> -<00:05:02.279> it's

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:03.749 
would be the end of the 3/8 inch - it's

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.279 
would be the end of the 3/8 inch - it's
cemented<00:05:04.749> in<00:05:04.959> place<00:05:04.989> at<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:05.499> top

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:50.410 

take<00:05:10.889> just<00:05:11.069> a<00:05:11.189> couple<00:05:11.430> minutes

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.730 

your<00:05:51.420> level<00:05:51.780> looks<00:05:51.930> like<00:05:52.110> it's<00:05:52.290> dropping<00:05:52.560> down

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
your level looks like it's dropping down

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:16.810 
your level looks like it's dropping down
below<00:05:53.310> zip<00:05:53.790> tie

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:26.260 

retarded<00:06:17.540> disengaged<00:06:18.290> in<00:06:18.470> a<00:06:18.530> minute<00:06:18.800> now

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.350 

hope<00:06:27.270> you<00:06:27.540> just<00:06:27.750> heard<00:06:27.930> it<00:06:28.520> if<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.670> vacuum<00:06:29.880> was

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
hope you just heard it if the vacuum was

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.860 
hope you just heard it if the vacuum was
broken<00:06:30.890> siphon<00:06:31.890> disengaged<00:06:32.660> now<00:06:33.660> we're

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
broken siphon disengaged now we're

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.860 
broken siphon disengaged now we're
filling<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.350> water<00:06:34.560> level<00:06:34.890> will<00:06:35.010> rise<00:06:35.220> and<00:06:35.870> as

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
filling the water level will rise and as

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.240 
filling the water level will rise and as
you<00:06:36.990> can<00:06:37.170> see<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.900> water<00:06:40.200> is<00:06:40.620> returning<00:06:41.100> to

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
you can see the water is returning to

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.110 
you can see the water is returning to
the<00:06:41.370> reservoir<00:06:41.970> because<00:06:42.630> we've<00:06:43.380> just<00:06:44.120> started

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
the reservoir because we've just started

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:54.110 
the reservoir because we've just started
the<00:06:45.300> new<00:06:45.660> cycle<00:06:50.720> just<00:06:51.720> so<00:06:51.990> we<00:06:52.140> can<00:06:52.940> see<00:06:53.940> that

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
the new cycle just so we can see that

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.770 
the new cycle just so we can see that
this<00:06:54.330> will<00:06:54.540> work<00:06:55.410> automatically<00:06:56.630> we'll<00:06:57.630> wait

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
this will work automatically we'll wait

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:06.310 
this will work automatically we'll wait
until<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.170> siphon<00:06:58.560> re-engages

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.560 

you<00:07:06.800> want<00:07:07.010> to<00:07:07.070> see<00:07:07.220> it<00:07:07.340> come<00:07:07.520> up<00:07:07.700> to<00:07:07.730> ride<00:07:08.150> about

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
you want to see it come up to ride about

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.340 
you want to see it come up to ride about
where<00:07:08.750> that<00:07:08.950> dark<00:07:09.950> line<00:07:10.190> is<00:07:10.810> I'm<00:07:11.810> a<00:07:11.870> siphon

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
where that dark line is I'm a siphon

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.160 
where that dark line is I'm a siphon
tube<00:07:16.060> and<00:07:17.060> then<00:07:17.210> you<00:07:17.300> hear<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.510> water<00:07:17.810> start

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
tube and then you hear the water start

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.910 
tube and then you hear the water start
to<00:07:18.230> trickle<00:07:18.970> and<00:07:20.260> then<00:07:21.260> the<00:07:21.350> siphon<00:07:21.770> will

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
to trickle and then the siphon will

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:30.920 
to trickle and then the siphon will
engage

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:38.710 

water<00:07:31.930> trickling<00:07:33.540> siphons<00:07:34.540> engage

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.030 

water<00:07:39.380> level<00:07:39.770> is<00:07:39.890> starting<00:07:40.190> to<00:07:40.310> drop<00:07:40.520> now<00:07:42.040> so

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
water level is starting to drop now so

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.830 
water level is starting to drop now so
as<00:07:43.940> long<00:07:44.150> as<00:07:44.210> your<00:07:44.570> pump<00:07:44.780> is<00:07:45.220> pumping<00:07:46.220> water<00:07:46.840> up
