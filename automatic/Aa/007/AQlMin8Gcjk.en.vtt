00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.609 
figures silver it shows a stripe but on
the<00:01:24.509> actual<00:01:24.750> figure<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> don't<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the actual figure I don't see that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
the actual figure I don't see that
stripe<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.759> hope<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> figure

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
stripe so I hope that's on the figure

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
stripe so I hope that's on the figure
and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> supercharged

personally<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.079> looks<00:01:34.110> extremely

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670 
personally I think it looks extremely
better<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.610> its<00:01:35.909> regular<00:01:36.329> version<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
better in its regular version because it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.460 
better in its regular version because it
just<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.159> looks<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.180> cooler<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.049> opinion

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
