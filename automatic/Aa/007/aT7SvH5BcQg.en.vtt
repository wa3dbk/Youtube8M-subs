piece<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.910> difficult<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
piece was a little difficult because of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.000 
piece was a little difficult because of
all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.430> curves<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.789> cutters<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.010> shape

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
all the curves and cutters of the shape

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
all the curves and cutters of the shape
of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> controller<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.199> painted<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of the controller that I just painted a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.570 
of the controller that I just painted a
flat<00:01:02.280> black<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> main<00:01:04.290> piece<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
flat black on to the main piece but I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.510 
flat black on to the main piece but I
continued<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> wood<00:01:06.510> grain<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
continued the wood grain on to the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
continued the wood grain on to the
battery<00:01:08.520> pack<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:11.150> I'm<00:01:12.150> thinking<00:01:12.210> about

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
battery pack so I'm thinking about

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
battery pack so I'm thinking about
selling<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.500> controller<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.930> mean<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
selling this controller I mean it's a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359 
selling this controller I mean it's a
brand<00:01:17.310> new<00:01:17.460> controller<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
brand new controller it was this is the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
brand new controller it was this is the
controller<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.150> opened<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
controller that was opened out of the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.660 
controller that was opened out of the
package<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.400> last<00:01:23.759> video<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:26.220> still

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
package in my last video and I still

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
package in my last video and I still
haven't<00:01:26.700> painted<00:01:27.090> anything<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> other

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
haven't painted anything on the other

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.620 
haven't painted anything on the other
controller<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> still<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
controller so if you still have and I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.609 
controller so if you still have and I
dr1<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.110> controller<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:31.460> not<00:01:31.579> too<00:01:31.820> late<00:01:32.619> but

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
dr1 a controller it's not too late but

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.469 
dr1 a controller it's not too late but
I'm<00:01:34.490> thinking<00:01:34.820> about<00:01:35.000> selling<00:01:35.240> this

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
I'm thinking about selling this

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.529 
I'm thinking about selling this
controller<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.200> probably<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.740> best<00:01:37.189> offer

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
controller it probably the best offer

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.310 
controller it probably the best offer
right<00:01:38.539> now<00:01:39.759> but<00:01:40.759> i<00:01:41.180> mean<00:01:41.450> if<00:01:41.780> i<00:01:41.899> don't<00:01:42.110> get<00:01:42.200> what

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
right now but i mean if i don't get what

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.779 
right now but i mean if i don't get what
i<00:01:42.380> want<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.920> i'll<00:01:43.039> probably<00:01:43.250> just<00:01:43.399> feel<00:01:43.700> like

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
i want and i'll probably just feel like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.510 
i want and i'll probably just feel like
whatever<00:01:44.179> your<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.689> i'll<00:01:44.810> keep<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.399> cuz<00:01:46.399> i

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
whatever your and i'll keep it cuz i

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.080 
whatever your and i'll keep it cuz i
think<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.820> looks<00:01:46.970> pretty<00:01:47.030> cool<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.799> um<00:01:49.090> yeah

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
think it looks pretty cool but um yeah

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.889 
think it looks pretty cool but um yeah
so<00:01:50.420> that's<00:01:51.319> pretty<00:01:51.500> much<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:52.119> my<00:01:53.119> stupid<00:01:53.750> dog

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
so that's pretty much it my stupid dog

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.620 
so that's pretty much it my stupid dog
spawn<00:01:54.229> at<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.560> door<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.979> can<00:01:55.130> hear<00:01:55.250> that

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
spawn at the door if you can hear that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.999 
spawn at the door if you can hear that
but<00:01:56.630> um<00:01:56.899> that's<00:01:57.890> pretty<00:01:58.399> much<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.610> just

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
but um that's pretty much it just

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
yeah I'll probably be more controllers

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.370
