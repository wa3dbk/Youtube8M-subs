00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
underneath the sketch layer which is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:54.440 
underneath the sketch layer which is
great

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.530 

now<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> your<00:02:55.740> lines<00:02:56.040> allit<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.819> click<00:02:57.390> on

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
that little checkerboard symbol that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.880 
that little checkerboard symbol that
locks<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.489> layer<00:03:00.080> then<00:03:01.080> go<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.410> your<00:03:01.620> brush

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.550 

then<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.210> do<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.660> select<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

darkest<00:03:12.950> colors<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.240> object<00:03:14.750> then<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.590> go

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
darkest colors in the object then I go

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.180 
darkest colors in the object then I go
to<00:03:15.770> my<00:03:16.130> color<00:03:16.520> palette<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.590> make<00:03:18.800> an<00:03:18.950> even

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
to my color palette and I make an even

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.730 
to my color palette and I make an even
darker<00:03:19.520> color<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:21.080> will<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.500> color

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
darker color and this will be the color

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.720 
darker color and this will be the color
of<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:22.070> outline

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
of my outline

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.050 
of my outline
I<00:03:23.410> turned<00:03:24.410> my<00:03:24.560> opacity<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.550> ten<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:25.940> my

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
I turned my opacity up to ten on my

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.230 
I turned my opacity up to ten on my
brush<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.570> then<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.620> start<00:03:28.240> painting

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
brush and then I just start painting

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960 
brush and then I just start painting
over<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.930> as<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.200> can<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.890> makes<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.760> so

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
over and as you can see it makes it so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.200 
over and as you can see it makes it so
you<00:03:32.240> are<00:03:32.270> only<00:03:32.510> painting<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.440> lines<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.210> I

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
you are only painting on the lines and I

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.870 
you are only painting on the lines and I
vary<00:03:35.690> my<00:03:35.780> color<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.260> bit<00:03:36.520> depending<00:03:37.520> on<00:03:37.640> if

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
vary my color a bit depending on if

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.200 
vary my color a bit depending on if
there's<00:03:38.090> lights<00:03:38.390> or<00:03:38.570> dark<00:03:38.780> areas<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:41.120> you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
there's lights or dark areas and if you

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.970 
there's lights or dark areas and if you
turn<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.600> other<00:03:41.810> layers<00:03:42.140> off<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.770> see

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
turn the other layers off you can see

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.570 
turn the other layers off you can see
we've<00:03:43.160> changed<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.670> color<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.180> lines<00:03:45.580> so

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
we've changed the color of the lines so

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.460 
we've changed the color of the lines so
what<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.820> like<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:47.360> after<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.870> make<00:03:48.320> an

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
what I like to do after that is make an

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.560 
what I like to do after that is make an
additional<00:03:48.980> layer<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:49.460> top<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.330> lines

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570
