know exactly what it is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.479 
know exactly what it is
but<00:02:20.010> when<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.250> test<00:02:21.489> results<00:02:23.160> live<00:02:24.160> data

grid yeah we have something a lot of
difference<00:02:29.250> things<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:31.269> can<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.720> values

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
difference things you can see the values

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.920 
difference things you can see the values
outside<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.800> we'll<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:34.360> rate<00:02:35.110> command

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
outside and we'll take this rate command

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.520 
outside and we'll take this rate command
and<00:02:37.930> all<00:02:38.080> stops<00:02:38.380> read<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> commands

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and update all the values as you can see

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.810 
and update all the values as you can see
here<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.180> arrow<00:02:49.400> cycling<00:02:50.400> through<00:02:50.550> and

here the arrow cycling through and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.790 
here the arrow cycling through and
updating<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:52.830> have<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.100> opportunity<00:02:53.460> to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
updating and we have this opportunity to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.660 
updating and we have this opportunity to
live<00:02:55.800> data<00:02:56.070> meter<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:57.600> choose<00:02:57.810> different

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
live data meter I can choose different

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.770 
live data meter I can choose different
thing<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.880> monitor<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.590> take<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.780> like

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
thing to a monitor we can take this like

Raph and we can take we can take what
you<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.460> take<00:03:11.240> calculated<00:03:12.240> load<00:03:12.570> value<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
you can take calculated load value that

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.200 
you can take calculated load value that
blah<00:03:13.770> blah<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:15.540> take<00:03:15.870> your<00:03:16.910> engine<00:03:17.910> coolant

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
blah blah I can take your engine coolant

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.760 
blah blah I can take your engine coolant
temperature<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.209> take<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.930> let's

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
temperature and I can take here let's

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.040 
temperature and I can take here let's
just<00:03:23.040> take<00:03:24.620> manifold<00:03:25.620> pressure<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.840> here

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
just take manifold pressure and here

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.310 
just take manifold pressure and here
let's<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.380> take<00:03:30.590> throttle<00:03:31.590> position<00:03:33.320> like

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
let's just take throttle position like

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:43.160 
let's just take throttle position like
this<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:37.550> stop<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> car<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:42.000> we'll<00:03:42.660> take<00:03:42.959> you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
this and stop the car and we'll take you

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.080 
this and stop the car and we'll take you
this<00:03:43.350> read<00:03:44.280> command

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
this read command

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.420 
this read command
a<00:03:46.709> needle<00:03:47.709> starts<00:03:48.269> read<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.450> values<00:03:51.780> no<00:03:52.780> no

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
a needle starts read the values no no

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.800 
a needle starts read the values no no
yeah<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.610> can<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:55.000> it

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.150 

she<00:03:58.440> is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.530 

very<00:04:02.790> cool

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.040 

say

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
say

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.580 
say
let's<00:04:08.680> try<00:04:08.890> something<00:04:09.190> different<00:04:09.700> here<00:04:10.590> you

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
let's try something different here you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.340 
let's try something different here you
have<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.890> stop<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.660> let's<00:04:13.660> see<00:04:13.840> if<00:04:13.900> we<00:04:14.020> can<00:04:14.170> take

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
have to stop it let's see if we can take

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.340 
have to stop it let's see if we can take
something<00:04:14.740> else

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
something else

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:27.000 
something else
vehicle<00:04:17.350> engine<00:04:17.970> rpm<00:04:20.730> like<00:04:21.730> this

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:46.370 

see<00:04:27.580> here<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.840> RPM

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.030 

so<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.100> quite<00:04:48.060> cool

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
so it's quite cool

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.290 
so it's quite cool
we'll<00:04:50.550> stop<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:51.380> what<00:04:52.380> else<00:04:52.670> this<00:04:53.670> live<00:04:53.970> data

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
we'll stop it what else this live data

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.890 
we'll stop it what else this live data
we<00:04:55.020> have<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.380> let's<00:04:56.250> just<00:04:56.460> try<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.940> will<00:04:57.720> check

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
we have to let's just try it will check

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.250 
we have to let's just try it will check
rapes<00:05:00.620> continues<00:05:01.940> potentially<00:05:03.110> update<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
rapes continues potentially update the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.330 
rapes continues potentially update the
values

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.600 

cycle<00:05:14.150> through<00:05:14.389> and<00:05:14.600> update<00:05:14.720> them<00:05:15.050> once<00:05:15.949> at<00:05:16.550> a

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
cycle through and update them once at a

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.480 
cycle through and update them once at a
time

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.680 

so

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
so

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.230 
so
it's<00:05:24.200> quite<00:05:24.410> good

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
it's quite good

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:36.260 
it's quite good
thank<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:26.960> for<00:05:27.080> watching
