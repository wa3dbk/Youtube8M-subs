 popular western tv series 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.240
 a new game of the season comes out once a year 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.760
 one way or another connected with the previous parts 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.850
 while you generally do not need to try 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.219
 all parts of the series 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.829
 you can start with any 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.429

 an era chosen by the authors 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.979
 but did not make a knight's move and instead 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.329
 specific location 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.359

 at least from the piracy of the popular bright and 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.420
 interesting to players from all over the world 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 it is therefore not surprising that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.720
 attention of the world press just 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.530
 previous parts 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 We will talk about this video asati with 3 4

 brawl why not bullying 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.080
 captives and what's the big deal 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.490
 but there is something like that that answers 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.400
 him from other pirates 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.380
 he is an assassin 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 which are willing to provide 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 robida last blood drop 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.670
 favorites are safe in an unusual way 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 they didn't make the main character 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.219
 positive 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.599
 on the contrary, they are happy to show 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.840
 the dark side of his character he 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.319
 ruthlessly killed 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.549
 which is ready to frame merchant ships and 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.210
 kill ordinary people 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.850
 just because he can 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.170
 by the right of the strong is not a cute girl 500 of which 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.920
 was divorced from Yakutia and it is not silent

 tiger today honored by long dignity 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.790
 at the same time the requirements were crazy for them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.450
 maniac 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.760
 he just pirates and lives as they lived 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 pirates are they buying

 key place vladislav 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.799
 predictably occupy the sea 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:31.319
 battle 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.010
 to capture the enemy's ship 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.770
 we need to cause him before 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 serious serb that is destroy everything 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.510
 his protective weapon 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 damage the sails and the mast 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.370
 after this begins boarding 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.720
 the most important thing in the capture of the ship to kill 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.579
 captain 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.349
 if you can do it quickly before 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.299
 bout finished minutes 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.029
 without a captain, the team quickly gives a ban 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.159
 further on the trailer decide what to do with 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.659
 loot we can turn the lead 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.299
 part of the captured pirates they came with a window and 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.529
 will serve on the side of kea hawaii 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.539
 or we can use 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.029
 materials received 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.409
 term learning your own Arabs in 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.919
 we have plenty of options 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.759
 because if the capture of the ship is like that 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.719
 less simple occupation of dollars 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.669
 neutralization of the fort is a whole art 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.579
 fortified desks and not the easiest 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.900
 attack center 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750
 you will be inferior to one two 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.400
 ship 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.539
 and land prices combat complex 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.550
 but you can destroy Kiev 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.270
 for that, truth will have to get you 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.859
 ship 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.609
 and set on him a special tool 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.919
 so just in local stores 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.429
 nothing suitable you will not find 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.089
 will have to look for treasure maps 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.790
 scattered around the world 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 and then orients the dead bird maps to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.590
 improvement drawings but so that you donâ€™t 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.010
 boring to give birth to the sea 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.270
 the developer added to the game beautiful 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.659
 pirate songs 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.719
 asked your team and performer 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.610
 several of them 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.750
 that sounds great especially if 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.760
 take into account the fact that Koreans are songs 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 can replenish 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.509
 Boris enemies have changed not very 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.140
 strong 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.190
 at least for now nothing new we 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.030
 have seen 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.360
 unless they became a little brighter more dynamic 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.210
 but in general the imprint warehouses that we 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.400
 not given seen and not once or twice but where 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.850
 more often it can seriously shake 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.380
 asus series positions sparkles in the market 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.640
 tom that from game to game 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.210
 the author did this for the most part 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.260
 cosmetic edits when it comes 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.809
 comes in on the combat system 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.919
 so it is obvious that the cloud headed where 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.500
 pistols play a big role 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.180
 sixth in a row get them 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.690
 as 3 4 enemies immediately go to the best 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.300
 world 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.680
 looks cute and spectacular but to name 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.480
 This is a serious step. 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.190
 not 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.010
 language does not turn out 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.390
 innovations worth noting glad that 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.880
 murder contracts by doing them we can 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.830
 to earn money 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.849
 as well as get fame points 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.999
 about offer to kill two takes of the Russian Federation 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.689
 local media may be our enemies 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.369
 shown the map killing in one then 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:52.649
 starts chasing the other 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:55.169
 and gently resentment flows into the sea 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.550
 as you already understood here a lot 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.240
 tied to the sea 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.380
 mixed feelings cause and place 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.130
 staged when the hero sneaks 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.940
 the enemies of ki will accidentally scare away 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.930
 a flock of birds his opponents begin 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.889
 look around and talk supposedly 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.880
 who here they will check the flute 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.219
 consumer not worth 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.720
 it's add about personality but essentially 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.690
 should have been realized where 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.469
 earlier than those who are apart 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.339
 can the authors over something surprise 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.289
 the final version of the game I doubt 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.509
 on the other hand, it is based on a hasis 3 4 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:26.170
 Blatter 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.770
 for evaluation is not afraid and there is following 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.170
 fifty huge posters are waiting for us 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.390
 including cube to gods and caribbean 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.500
 Florida each will please us buny 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.790
 chambers credits nature and a bunch 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.180
 secrets on waiting for immersion and 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.740
 explore the underwater world 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.750
 we have treasure and destructive 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.379
 storms 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.589
 which you can easily get 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.129
 gouging your precious ship 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.469
 and here it may attract attention 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:51.570
 mass brawl 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.789
 and fights 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:53.960
 let's be honest 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.500
 they start three parts 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.699
 as they also did not sit forced 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.749
 as someone from my colleagues said 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.139
 all i've been doing posts with 3 3 is 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.070
 some kind of horror 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.620
 according to hunter simulator but boring 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.490
 a game 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.370
 how to stay with 3 4 did not become main 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.080
 seafarer's stimulator 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.919
 when go to the open sea 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.349
 and was it too far away 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.550
 and the game 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.619
 game passed 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.379
 it's much more interesting here to just live 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.490
 that's all 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.880
 good luck for meeting on site applaud 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.130
 rub
