00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
aperture which would be pretty nice

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.270

currently take pictures in F stupid to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.520 
currently take pictures in F stupid to
aperture<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.540> guy<00:02:27.989> from<00:02:28.200> five

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
aperture and I think that guy from five

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520 
aperture and I think that guy from five
earlier<00:02:28.769> than<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.220> had<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:30.030> f<00:02:30.209> 2.4<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.379> this

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
earlier than that had like f 2.4 so this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.059 
earlier than that had like f 2.4 so this
would<00:02:31.739> be<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> nice<00:02:32.400> step<00:02:32.910> down<00:02:33.180> here<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.680> even

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
would be a nice step down here to even

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.789 
would be a nice step down here to even
better<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:36.209> then<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.810> also<00:02:36.989> had<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> rumor<00:02:37.739> that
