00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.000 
kind of surfaced around the internet
pretty<00:00:09.240> widely<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.139> mean<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.530> already<00:00:10.830> has

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
pretty widely I mean it already has

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.249 
pretty widely I mean it already has
about<00:00:11.480> 30,000<00:00:12.480> views<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.929> that's<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.230> the

that was a couple of days ago now there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
that was a couple of days ago now there
are<00:00:42.660> reasons<00:00:43.620> listed<00:00:43.950> below<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.120> agree

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
are reasons listed below and I can agree

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
are reasons listed below and I can agree
with<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.780> reasons<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> why<00:00:46.500> this

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
with all these reasons as to why this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
with all these reasons as to why this
would<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.219> fake<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.270> reason<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> want

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
would be fake but the reason why I want

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
would be fake but the reason why I want
to<00:00:49.020> talk<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> does

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to talk about this is because it does

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.330 
to talk about this is because it does
bring<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:50.969> interesting<00:00:51.149> concepts<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
bring out some interesting concepts and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.119 
bring out some interesting concepts and
it's<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> said<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.800> really

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it's just it's like I said it's really

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.590 
it's just it's like I said it's really
interesting<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> how<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
interesting as to how they kind of you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.490 
interesting as to how they kind of you
know<00:00:57.660> bring<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> they're<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
know bring this up so they're in this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
know bring this up so they're in this
video<00:01:01.829> they're<00:01:02.550> making<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.149> thing<00:01:03.420> called

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
video they're making this thing called

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
video they're making this thing called
of<00:01:03.899> course<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.409> Nintendo<00:01:04.830> cross<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
of course the Nintendo cross which I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
of course the Nintendo cross which I
guess<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.689> would<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:06.930> sense<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.770> it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
guess that would make sense if it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
guess that would make sense if it's
called<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> X<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:11.060> Nintendo<00:01:12.060> cross<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
called the in X so Nintendo cross and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
called the in X so Nintendo cross and
all<00:01:13.080> they're<00:01:13.320> trying<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.340> seems

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
all they're trying to do is it seems

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
all they're trying to do is it seems
like<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.840> actual<00:01:16.020> system<00:01:16.619> itself

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
like it's the the actual system itself

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.749 
like it's the the actual system itself
is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.330> hub<00:01:18.470> but<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> use<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.070> mobile<00:01:20.340> device

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is a hub but you use your mobile device

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.859 
is a hub but you use your mobile device
or<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:22.409> gamepad<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> game

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
or a gamepad to actually play the game

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.499 
or a gamepad to actually play the game
on<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.070> basically

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
on it but you're just basically

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.380 
on it but you're just basically
streaming<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> over<00:01:28.280> that's<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.640> concept<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
streaming it over that's the concept I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.749 
streaming it over that's the concept I
think<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.680> trying<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> get

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
think that's what they're trying to get

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
think that's what they're trying to get
here<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.090> video<00:01:33.420> um<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.200> that's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
here in this video um and that's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
here in this video um and that's
actually<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.400> idea<00:01:35.820> because

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
actually a really good idea because

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
actually a really good idea because
obviously<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:37.200> said<00:01:37.409> mobile

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
obviously you know they said mobile

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
obviously you know they said mobile
games<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> come<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:39.329> our<00:01:39.360> market

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
games are going to come to our market

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
games are going to come to our market
now<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> stuff<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
now and stuff like that and it's just

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
now and stuff like that and it's just
really<00:01:42.570> interesting<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:44.399> put

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
really interesting to see then put

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.590 
really interesting to see then put
something<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.479> also

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
something out like this they also

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.760 
something out like this they also
mentioned<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.680> an

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
mentioned that you know would have an

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
mentioned that you know would have an
AMD<00:01:46.979> processor<00:01:47.520> blah<00:01:47.729> blah<00:01:47.850> blah<00:01:48.140> again<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
AMD processor blah blah blah again it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.219 
AMD processor blah blah blah again it
looks<00:01:49.649> pretty<00:01:50.159> fake<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> surprised

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
looks pretty fake I'm kind of surprised

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.639 
looks pretty fake I'm kind of surprised
to<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:53.009> many<00:01:53.340> views<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.140> cut<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to get this many views it is cut it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.700 
to get this many views it is cut it
would<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.189> convincing<00:01:57.000> though<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.530> be

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
would be convincing though it would be

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
would be convincing though it would be
convincing<00:01:59.399> though<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.210> did

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
convincing though if they actually did

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.160 
convincing though if they actually did
the<00:02:01.140> whole<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.829> Japanese<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the whole thing in Japanese and not the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.819 
the whole thing in Japanese and not the
first<00:02:04.439> trailer<00:02:04.920> thingy<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.729> English<00:02:06.600> because

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
first trailer thingy in English because

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.249 
first trailer thingy in English because
it's<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.950> shareholders<00:02:08.520> meeting<00:02:08.550> for

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
it's a shareholders meeting for

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's a shareholders meeting for
basically<00:02:10.259> all<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> Oliver

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
basically all the Oliver

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.330 
basically all the Oliver
you<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:12.049> mean<00:02:13.049> maybe<00:02:13.439> it's<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.159> I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
you know I mean maybe it's not but I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.640 
you know I mean maybe it's not but I
would<00:02:14.790> assume<00:02:15.120> their<00:02:15.629> shareholders<00:02:16.260> meeting

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
would assume their shareholders meeting

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.160 
would assume their shareholders meeting
why<00:02:16.799> would<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.040> suddenly<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.879> go<00:02:18.060> from<00:02:18.810> all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
why would it suddenly just go from all

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.619 
why would it suddenly just go from all
japanese<00:02:19.860> text<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> full<00:02:20.700> English<00:02:21.180> trailer

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
japanese text to a full English trailer

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.149 
japanese text to a full English trailer
why<00:02:22.019> would<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.409> do<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> why<00:02:22.920> would<00:02:22.950> they

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
why would they do that why would they

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.220 
why would they do that why would they
show<00:02:23.310> an<00:02:23.430> English<00:02:23.849> trailer<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
show an English trailer and what it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990

seemed<00:02:25.409> like<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.739> Japanese<00:02:26.370> shareholder

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
seemed like a Japanese shareholder

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
seemed like a Japanese shareholder
meeting<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.599> what<00:02:27.810> why<00:02:28.200> would<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.950> that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
meeting so what why would they do that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.809 
meeting so what why would they do that
plus<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.269> hands<00:02:30.659> look<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.170> fake

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
plus the just the hands look really fake

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.380 
plus the just the hands look really fake
the<00:02:32.819> music<00:02:33.859> we're<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.269> know

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the music we're the not you know

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.259 
the music we're the not you know
capitalizing<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> words<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.939> just<00:02:39.150> got

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
capitalizing the words and it just got

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.280 
capitalizing the words and it just got
too<00:02:39.420> looks<00:02:39.629> weird<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.319> there<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
too looks weird here and there and it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.280 
too looks weird here and there and it
doesn't<00:02:43.889> look<00:02:43.920> great<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.690> concept

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
doesn't look great but just the concept

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
doesn't look great but just the concept
of<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.639> interesting<00:02:48.299> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
of it actually is really interesting and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.690 
of it actually is really interesting and
maybe<00:02:48.799> we<00:02:49.799> would<00:02:49.950> actually<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.459> something

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
maybe we would actually see something

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.690 
maybe we would actually see something
like<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.889> maybe<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.250> some<00:02:53.519> sort

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
like this because maybe it is some sort

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.660 
like this because maybe it is some sort
of<00:02:53.760> cross<00:02:54.030> platform<00:02:54.720> where<00:02:55.409> it's<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.609> to

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of cross platform where it's going to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.220 
of cross platform where it's going to
stream<00:02:56.939> on<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.420> your<00:02:57.540> mobile<00:02:57.659> device<00:02:57.989> via

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
stream on to your mobile device via

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.580

iphone via tablet via android via we

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.619 
iphone via tablet via android via we
gamepad<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.250> maybe<00:03:02.639> that's<00:03:02.909> what<00:03:03.480> their

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
gamepad and maybe that's what their

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.720 
gamepad and maybe that's what their
whole<00:03:03.659> thing<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.049> because<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.489> know<00:03:05.609> they

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
whole thing is because you know they

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.099 
whole thing is because you know they
mentioned<00:03:06.060> about<00:03:06.180> mobile<00:03:06.510> games<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.079> they

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
mentioned about mobile games but they

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.509 
mentioned about mobile games but they
didn't<00:03:07.379> really<00:03:07.560> go<00:03:07.680> too<00:03:07.739> much<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.220> depth<00:03:08.400> about

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
didn't really go too much in depth about

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.610 
didn't really go too much in depth about
they<00:03:09.000> also<00:03:09.150> mentioned<00:03:09.389> about<00:03:09.659> Nintendo<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.470> X

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
they also mentioned about Nintendo and X

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.710 
they also mentioned about Nintendo and X
but<00:03:10.939> really<00:03:11.939> not<00:03:12.030> say<00:03:12.239> anything<00:03:12.359> about<00:03:12.540> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
but really not say anything about that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.110 
but really not say anything about that
either<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:14.129> if<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.400> literally<00:03:14.849> just

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
either so what if this is literally just

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.569 
either so what if this is literally just
merging<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.780> two<00:03:15.810> together<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.470> yes<00:03:17.220> it's

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
merging the two together and yes it's

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.670 
merging the two together and yes it's
going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> cross-platform<00:03:18.680> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
going to be a cross-platform that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.259 
going to be a cross-platform that
actually<00:03:20.040> might<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.370> pretty<00:03:20.549> interesting<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
actually might be pretty interesting and

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.199 
actually might be pretty interesting and
if<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> look<00:03:22.079> at<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.260> shareholder<00:03:22.859> uh

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
if you look at the shareholder uh

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.059 
if you look at the shareholder uh
resuming<00:03:24.209> every<00:03:24.449> all<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:25.069> everybody's

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
resuming every all of everybody's

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.309 
resuming every all of everybody's
shareholders<00:03:26.639> on<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.239> think<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.629> interest<00:03:28.049> or

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
shareholders on I think it's interest or

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.629 
shareholders on I think it's interest or
not<00:03:28.560> interest<00:03:28.980> something<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.609> that

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
not interest something like that

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.020 
not interest something like that
percentage<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.859> basically<00:03:31.859> got<00:03:32.250> raised<00:03:32.519> which

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
percentage I basically got raised which

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.369 
percentage I basically got raised which
means<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.659> know<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> shareholders

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
means that you know the shareholders

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.720 
means that you know the shareholders
liked<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.280> know<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:35.489> want<00:03:35.609> to

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
liked it and you know they want to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.379 
liked it and you know they want to
support<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> company<00:03:36.329> more<00:03:36.449> so<00:03:38.269> that's<00:03:39.269> going

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
support the company more so that's going

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.089 
support the company more so that's going
to<00:03:39.449> be<00:03:39.510> really<00:03:39.659> interesting<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.169> see<00:03:40.409> how<00:03:40.709> all

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
to be really interesting to see how all

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.680 
to be really interesting to see how all
this<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:42.120> know<00:03:43.010> comes<00:03:44.010> about<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.609> just<00:03:45.030> don't

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
this you know comes about I just don't

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.899 
this you know comes about I just don't
know<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.500> probably<00:03:46.859> not<00:03:47.069> going<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.310> you

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
know but it's probably not going to you

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.369 
know but it's probably not going to you
know<00:03:48.000> look<00:03:48.329> like<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.169> probably

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
know look like that but it's probably

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.899 
know look like that but it's probably
going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.680> similar<00:03:50.010> concept<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.579> do<00:03:50.729> like

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
going to be a similar concept I do like
