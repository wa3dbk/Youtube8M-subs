00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
thing really sturdy can take a lot of

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.300 
thing really sturdy can take a lot of
use<00:02:41.450> next<00:02:42.450> thing<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.020> hook<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.650> many

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
use next thing is the hook and many

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.730 
use next thing is the hook and many
people<00:02:44.850> are<00:02:45.090> lost<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.930> words<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.350> when<00:02:46.620> they

people are lost for words and when they

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.860 
people are lost for words and when they
get<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.010> hook<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:48.090> I've<00:02:48.390> thought<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
get to the hook but I've thought a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.320 
get to the hook but I've thought a
little<00:02:49.050> bit<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.160> ever<00:02:50.280> go<00:02:50.520> fishing<00:02:50.850> it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
little bit and if you ever go fishing it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.090 
little bit and if you ever go fishing it
could<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.720> used<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.290> you're<00:02:52.440> stringing<00:02:52.890> up

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
could be used if you're stringing up

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.820 
could be used if you're stringing up
anything<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:53.880> mono<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:55.470> could<00:02:55.620> actually

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
anything with mono you could actually

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.460 
anything with mono you could actually
mono<00:02:56.490> can<00:02:56.790> cut<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.270> your<00:02:57.450> skin<00:02:57.750> sometimes<00:02:58.050> if

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
mono can cut in your skin sometimes if

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.340 
mono can cut in your skin sometimes if
it's<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.950> thin<00:02:59.490> tests<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.180> small<00:03:00.870> task<00:03:01.110> so

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it's really thin tests and small task so

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's really thin tests and small task so
you<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:02.010> probably<00:03:02.250> grab<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.820> loop<00:03:03.150> amano

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
you could probably grab a loop amano

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
you could probably grab a loop amano
with<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.990> or<00:03:04.200> something<00:03:04.560> something<00:03:05.130> like

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
with this or something something like

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.150 
with this or something something like
that<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:07.020> would<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:07.350> some<00:03:07.560> uses<00:03:07.890> if<00:03:08.070> you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that so it would have some uses if you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.600 
that so it would have some uses if you
thought<00:03:08.340> about<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.710> last<00:03:10.710> thing<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.310> your

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
thought about it and last thing is your

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.010 
thought about it and last thing is your
reamer<00:03:11.880> ensuing<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.020> comes<00:03:13.770> with<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> sharp<00:03:14.310> edge

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
reamer ensuing I comes with a sharp edge

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.790 
reamer ensuing I comes with a sharp edge
pointy<00:03:16.020> tip<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:17.240> okay<00:03:18.240> so<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:19.680> it
