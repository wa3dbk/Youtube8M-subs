just<00:00:22.240> announcing<00:00:22.840> what<00:00:23.169> this<00:00:23.410> thing<00:00:23.619> is<00:00:23.650> what

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
just announcing what this thing is what

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.140 
just announcing what this thing is what
it<00:00:24.460> does<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:25.169> all<00:00:26.169> that<00:00:26.560> now<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.609> starting

more features as you can see they made
this<00:01:47.700> gtx<00:01:48.700> 690<00:01:49.360> look<00:01:50.310> industrial<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.520> i<00:01:52.000> think

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
this gtx 690 look industrial and i think

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.219 
this gtx 690 look industrial and i think
they<00:01:52.750> did<00:01:52.990> quite<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.680> well<00:01:54.010> job<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.869> it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
they did quite a well job because it

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.280 
they did quite a well job because it
does<00:01:56.830> look<00:01:57.310> fairly<00:01:57.880> nice<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.810> spread

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290

does look fairly nice this is spread
pretty<00:01:59.740> much<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.880> nicest<00:02:01.570> reference<00:02:02.530> card<00:02:02.890> i

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
pretty much the nicest reference card i

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.320 
pretty much the nicest reference card i
have<00:02:03.460> ever<00:02:03.700> seen<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.320> quite<00:02:05.979> good<00:02:06.400> now

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

more<00:02:32.260> info<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.920> i'm<00:02:33.040> not<00:02:33.190> telling

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
more info because i'm not telling

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.510 
more info because i'm not telling
everything<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.020> video<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
everything in this video go to the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.600 
everything in this video go to the
website<00:02:36.960> now<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.020> have<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.500> GPU<00:02:38.920> over<00:02:39.430> here

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
website now you have the GPU over here

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.949 
website now you have the GPU over here
and<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.600> memory<00:02:41.940> slide<00:02:42.940> projector<00:02:43.180> our

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
and there the memory slide projector our

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.070 
and there the memory slide projector our
supply<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:45.370> basically<00:02:46.180> giving<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> power

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
supply just basically giving the power

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.900 
supply just basically giving the power
to<00:02:47.290> both<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.860> GPUs<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:50.530> let's<00:02:51.160> hop<00:02:51.459> over

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
to both of the GPUs now let's hop over

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.570 
to both of the GPUs now let's hop over
to<00:02:52.230> technologies<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.530> check<00:02:54.100> out<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.310> more

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
to technologies and check out some more

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.710 
to technologies and check out some more
features<00:02:55.120> over<00:02:55.420> there<00:02:56.130> nvidia<00:02:57.130> TX<00:02:57.730> AAA<00:02:58.090> which

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
features over there nvidia TX AAA which

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.510 
features over there nvidia TX AAA which
is<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.350> new<00:02:59.620> version<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:02.520> anti-aliasing

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
is the new version of anti-aliasing

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.120 
is the new version of anti-aliasing
which<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.660> which<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.850> using<00:03:06.850> less<00:03:07.750> memory<00:03:08.500> but

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
which is which is using less memory but

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.300 
which is which is using less memory but
it<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.430> performing<00:03:10.270> better<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:11.800> also

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
it is performing better so you can also

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.150 
it is performing better so you can also
get<00:03:12.670> more<00:03:13.030> FPS<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.680> will<00:03:14.920> look

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
get more FPS out of this and will look

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.660 
get more FPS out of this and will look
nicer<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.959> win-win<00:03:19.799> adaptive<00:03:20.799> vsync<00:03:21.130> is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
nicer so it's win-win adaptive vsync is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.770 
nicer so it's win-win adaptive vsync is
basically<00:03:22.209> once<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.630> go<00:03:22.810> above<00:03:23.970> 60<00:03:24.970> FPS<00:03:25.480> it

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
basically once you go above 60 FPS it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.180 
basically once you go above 60 FPS it
will<00:03:25.989> try<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.820> stay<00:03:27.820> at<00:03:28.030> 60fps<00:03:28.780> all<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.950> time

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
will try to stay at 60fps all the time

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.380 
will try to stay at 60fps all the time
and<00:03:30.489> once<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.110> under<00:03:32.650> 60<00:03:33.130> FPS<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.850> will

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
and once you get under 60 FPS it will

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.610 
and once you get under 60 FPS it will
stop<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.810> fee<00:03:35.170> sing<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.239> doesn't

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
stop the fee sing so it so it doesn't

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.170 
stop the fee sing so it so it doesn't
stutter<00:03:38.620> because<00:03:39.190> otherwise<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.970> will<00:03:40.120> just

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
stutter because otherwise it will just

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.370 
stutter because otherwise it will just
fall<00:03:40.840> down<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.320> dirty<00:03:41.620> FBS<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.230> won't

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
fall down to dirty FBS and you you won't

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.580 
fall down to dirty FBS and you you won't
like<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.420> starting<00:03:46.420> all<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.900> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
like that and just starting all that the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.270 
like that and just starting all that the
video<00:03:47.860> physics<00:03:48.370> that's<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:49.350> making<00:03:50.350> yeah

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
video physics that's just making yeah

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.160 
video physics that's just making yeah
III<00:03:51.880> don't<00:03:52.180> know<00:03:52.330> how<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.570> explain<00:03:53.049> this

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
III don't know how to explain this

pretty much covers up most of the

pretty much covers up most of the
features<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.239> how<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.080> looks<00:04:05.410> off<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:07.350> gtx
