to figure out how to get to the tie
wraps<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:28.630> guess<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> truck<00:02:29.959> just

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
wraps on this I guess the truck just

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.330 
wraps on this I guess the truck just
slips<00:02:30.350> out<00:02:35.200> alright<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:36.829> four<00:02:37.100> tire

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
slips out alright so we have four tire

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.360 
slips out alright so we have four tire
wraps<00:02:37.579> at<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.850> bottom<00:02:44.170> cut<00:02:45.170> those<00:02:45.410> off

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.110 

hopefully<00:02:49.370> there's<00:02:49.519> nothing<00:02:49.790> else<00:02:49.910> hidden

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
hopefully there's nothing else hidden

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.509 
hopefully there's nothing else hidden
but<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.510> truck<00:02:50.750> should<00:02:50.900> just<00:02:51.310> fall<00:02:52.310> out<00:02:52.340> of

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
but the truck should just fall out of
