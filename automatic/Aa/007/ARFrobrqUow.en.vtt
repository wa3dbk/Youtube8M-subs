you're wondering what specific sound

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.399 
you're wondering what specific sound
performance<00:03:44.000> settings<00:03:44.629> I've<00:03:44.930> been<00:03:45.169> using

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
performance settings I've been using

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.770 
performance settings I've been using
that<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.709> know<00:03:45.859> work<00:03:46.040> good<00:03:46.340> with<00:03:47.150> these<00:03:47.389> I'll

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
that I know work good with these I'll

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.809 
that I know work good with these I'll
just<00:03:47.989> give<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.260> go<00:03:48.739> back<00:03:48.889> into<00:03:49.040> configuration

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819

just give you go back into configuration
again<00:03:49.909> I<00:03:50.980> think<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.189> performances<00:03:54.609> that's

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
again I think it's performances that's

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.210 
again I think it's performances that's
what<00:03:55.790> I've<00:03:55.939> got<00:03:55.970> for<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:57.290> CDJ<00:03:57.769> 400<00:03:58.430> I've<00:03:59.180> got
