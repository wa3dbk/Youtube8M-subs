they're all set up with with single
strand<00:00:28.910> chinese-style<00:00:29.910> tubing<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> they're

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
strand chinese-style tubing so they're

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
strand chinese-style tubing so they're
not<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> more<00:00:33.360> power<00:00:33.630> crowd<00:00:34.050> but

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
not really for the more power crowd but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.080 
not really for the more power crowd but
they're<00:00:34.950> pretty<00:00:35.130> good<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.610> somebody<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:35.969> me

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
they're pretty good for somebody like me

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
they're pretty good for somebody like me
who<00:00:36.420> has<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> bum<00:00:37.410> arm<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.719> occasionally<00:00:39.719> can't

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
who has a bum arm and occasionally can't

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.280 
who has a bum arm and occasionally can't
shoot<00:00:40.290> anything<00:00:40.469> heavier<00:00:41.840> this<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.079> had

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
shoot anything heavier this one had

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
shoot anything heavier this one had
originally<00:00:43.710> been<00:00:43.770> set<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.460> their<00:00:44.730> blue

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
originally been set up with their blue

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.049 
originally been set up with their blue
thera-band<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.590> shot<00:00:46.829> fine<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.730> but

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
thera-band and it shot fine that way but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.950 
thera-band and it shot fine that way but
I<00:00:48.120> decided<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> switch<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> over<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> tubing

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
I decided to switch it over to tubing

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
I decided to switch it over to tubing
because<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.140> considering<00:00:52.649> putting<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.219> up

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because I'm considering putting these up

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.540 
because I'm considering putting these up
on<00:00:53.579> ebay<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.530> I<00:00:55.530> thought<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.100> might<00:00:56.250> sell

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
on ebay and I thought they might sell

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
on ebay and I thought they might sell
better<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.969> tubing<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.510> opposed<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
better with tubing as opposed to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.689 
better with tubing as opposed to
thera-band<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> thick<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> tubing<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thera-band the thick of the tubing is

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.140 
thera-band the thick of the tubing is
fine<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> said<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.070> for<00:01:05.070> medium<00:01:05.880> range

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
fine like I said for for medium range

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.050 
fine like I said for for medium range
target<00:01:06.780> shooting<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.500> short<00:01:08.250> range<00:01:08.520> target
