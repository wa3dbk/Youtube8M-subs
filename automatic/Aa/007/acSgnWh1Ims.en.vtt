00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and I do agree that it is a very easy

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.150 
and I do agree that it is a very easy
skill<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> get<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:09.900> but<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> reason<00:00:10.800> why<00:00:11.040> I'm

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
skill to get up but the reason why I'm

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.499 
skill to get up but the reason why I'm
doing<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.400> cooking<00:00:11.700> guide<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.389> may

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
doing this cooking guide when you may

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.209 
doing this cooking guide when you may
think<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.780> obvious<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.920> major

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
think it's obvious is for one major

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039 
think it's obvious is for one major
reason<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.030> that's<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.540> after<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
reason and that's because after the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.380 
reason and that's because after the
bonfire<00:00:16.260> update<00:00:16.920> came<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:18.180> was<00:00:18.300> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
may four fire making it also gives a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
may four fire making it also gives a
cooking<00:00:21.810> boost<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.890> quite<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> good

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
I put it a little lower than it should

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.740 
I put it a little lower than it should
be<00:02:49.430> why<00:02:49.609> because<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:50.180> are<00:02:50.239> always<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.480> lot<00:02:50.569> of

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.149 
be why because there are always a lot of
skeptics<00:02:51.200> who<00:02:51.349> will<00:02:51.470> say<00:02:51.650> unrealistic

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
skeptics who will say unrealistic

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.099 
skeptics who will say unrealistic
figures<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:53.269> putting<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.599> figures<00:02:53.900> at

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
figures so I'm putting the figures at

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.770 
figures so I'm putting the figures at
lower<00:02:54.349> than<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:54.799> actually<00:02:55.010> are<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.750> I

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
lower than they actually are so that I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.050 
lower than they actually are so that I
