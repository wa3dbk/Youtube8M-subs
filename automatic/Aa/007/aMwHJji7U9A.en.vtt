scenes like like this one commonly

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.220 
scenes like like this one commonly
you'll<00:00:10.469> find<00:00:10.800> problems<00:00:11.790> when<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
you'll find problems when you have a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.790 
you'll find problems when you have a
bright<00:00:13.620> sky<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.370> dark<00:00:14.610> landscape

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
bright sky and a dark landscape

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
bright sky and a dark landscape
typically<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:17.190> sunset<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.240> even<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
typically at sunset but even in the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
typically at sunset but even in the
middle<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.320> day<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
middle of a day like this it can be a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
middle of a day like this it can be a
lot<00:00:21.359> brighter<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> sky<00:00:22.289> than<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
lot brighter in the sky than it is on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.140 
lot brighter in the sky than it is on
the<00:00:23.430> landscape<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:25.519> of<00:00:26.519> course<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> use

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the landscape and of course you can use

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.929 
the landscape and of course you can use
filters<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> neutral<00:00:28.680> density<00:00:28.939> graduated

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
filters and neutral density graduated

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
filters and neutral density graduated
filters<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.660> pop<00:00:31.140> those<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.189> your

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
filters you can pop those on the on your

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
filters you can pop those on the on your
lens<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.320> they're<00:00:34.530> dark<00:00:34.770> at

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
lens and that all that they're dark at

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
lens and that all that they're dark at
the<00:00:35.010> top<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> light<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> bottom<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the top and light at the bottom so that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.139 
the top and light at the bottom so that
that<00:00:37.440> helps<00:00:37.770> even<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that helps even things up but if you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
that helps even things up but if you
don't<00:00:39.450> fancy<00:00:39.660> shelling<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.410> filters<00:00:41.040> or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
don't fancy shelling out for filters or

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
don't fancy shelling out for filters or
you<00:00:41.850> don't<00:00:42.149> want<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> lug<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.690> around<00:00:43.070> we

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you don't want to lug them around we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.209 
you don't want to lug them around we
just<00:00:44.250> want<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> faff<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
just want go on the faff of them and

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.430 
just want go on the faff of them and
then<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.610> technique<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.059> help<00:00:48.480> another

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
then this technique can help another

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.689 
then this technique can help another
option<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> HD<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:52.070> using<00:00:53.070> HDR

option would be HD are using HDR

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
option would be HD are using HDR
software<00:00:54.110> but<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> quite<00:00:56.340> unnatural

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
software but you can get quite unnatural

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
software but you can get quite unnatural
effects<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.219> going

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
effects of that so when what I'm going

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540 
effects of that so when what I'm going
to<00:00:59.399> show<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> blending<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to show you is a way of blending a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.679 
to show you is a way of blending a
couple<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> exposures<00:01:03.719> together<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.630> how<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
couple of exposures together and how you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.210 
couple of exposures together and how you
do<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.020> tripod<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
do that is you would take a tripod and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.260 
do that is you would take a tripod and
take<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.400> exposures<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.220> take

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.410 

a<00:01:17.329> shot<00:01:18.109> which<00:01:18.289> is<00:01:18.759> exposed<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.329> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
a shot which is exposed to the for the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.870 
a shot which is exposed to the for the
landscape<00:01:20.840> like<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.320> one<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:22.460> makes<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.820> a

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
landscape like this one that makes it a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.539 
landscape like this one that makes it a
landscape<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:23.450> pretty<00:01:23.630> bright<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.549> you

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
landscape but pretty bright and you

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.950 
landscape but pretty bright and you
would<00:01:25.700> take<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.299> for<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:29.539> exposed

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
would take one for that it's exposed

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.830 
would take one for that it's exposed
correctly<00:01:30.439> for<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.770> sky<00:01:31.069> like<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.030> one<00:01:32.299> so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
correctly for the sky like this one so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.289 
correctly for the sky like this one so
on<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.350> on<00:01:33.649> this<00:01:33.710> darker<00:01:34.369> photo<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.939> can<00:01:35.090> see

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
on this on this darker photo you can see

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.569 
on this on this darker photo you can see
that<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.630> landscape<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.679> bit<00:01:36.829> too<00:01:37.009> dark<00:01:37.280> but

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
that the landscape is a bit too dark but

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.240 
that the landscape is a bit too dark but
the<00:01:37.700> sky<00:01:37.939> is<00:01:37.969> just<00:01:38.659> about<00:01:38.869> right<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.469> on<00:01:40.100> this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
the sky is just about right and on this

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.399 
the sky is just about right and on this
one<00:01:40.549> vice<00:01:41.209> versa<00:01:41.829> so<00:01:42.829> what<00:01:43.100> I've<00:01:43.219> done<00:01:44.380> let<00:01:45.380> me

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
one vice versa so what I've done let me

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.929 
one vice versa so what I've done let me
just<00:01:45.560> get<00:01:45.890> rid<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.789> I've<00:01:49.909> done

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
just get rid of that so what I've done

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.460 
just get rid of that so what I've done
is<00:01:50.360> I've<00:01:52.929> copied<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:56.209> brighter<00:01:56.929> one<00:01:57.259> and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
is I've copied the brighter one and

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.620 
is I've copied the brighter one and
popped<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.799> on<00:01:57.920> top<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.640> darker<00:01:59.179> one<00:01:59.360> so

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
popped it on top of the darker one so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.139 
popped it on top of the darker one so
way<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.619> go<00:02:00.739> to<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.099> lighter<00:02:01.539> picture<00:02:04.149> control

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
way to go to the lighter picture control

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.350 
way to go to the lighter picture control
a<00:02:05.360> will<00:02:05.599> select<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.020> all<00:02:06.170> control<00:02:07.009> C<00:02:07.369> copy<00:02:08.119> it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
a will select it all control C copy it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.970 
a will select it all control C copy it
and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.310> ctrl<00:02:10.310> V<00:02:10.729> on<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.349> darker<00:02:12.769> one

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
and then ctrl V on to the darker one

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.270 
and then ctrl V on to the darker one
will<00:02:13.430> paste<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:14.000> over<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.269> top<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.129> can

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
will paste it over the top so you can

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.069 
will paste it over the top so you can
now<00:02:16.640> see<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.910> there's<00:02:17.209> two<00:02:17.390> layers<00:02:17.690> there's

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
now see that there's two layers there's

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.660 
now see that there's two layers there's
a<00:02:18.140> dark<00:02:18.410> background<00:02:18.620> layer<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> light

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
a dark background layer and the light

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
top layer you then click on add layer

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.160 
top layer you then click on add layer

you'll<00:02:29.239> just<00:02:29.389> have<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.720> use<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.989> eraser<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
you'll just have to use the eraser to to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.030 
you'll just have to use the eraser to to
basically<00:02:34.150> arrays<00:02:35.150> through<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.200> bright<00:02:36.650> sky

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
basically arrays through this bright sky

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.379 
basically arrays through this bright sky
and<00:02:37.370> reveal<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.359> darkest<00:02:38.900> guy<00:02:39.109> beneath<00:02:39.650> and

and reveal the darkest guy beneath and

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.640 
and reveal the darkest guy beneath and
but<00:02:41.389> i'm<00:02:41.510> just<00:02:41.540> going<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.959> use<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.290> add<00:02:42.410> layer

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650

you just paint paint over the opacity

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.589 
you just paint paint over the opacity
I've<00:02:58.730> got<00:02:58.910> thirty<00:02:59.299> one<00:02:59.569> percent<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.359> vary

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
I've got thirty one percent you can vary

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.800 
I've got thirty one percent you can vary
that<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.109> I<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:03.709> thirty<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:04.340> percent<00:03:04.810> seems

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that but I like thirty one percent seems

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 
that but I like thirty one percent seems
ok<00:03:05.959> because<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.560> could<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:06.829> keep<00:03:07.040> painting

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340

some of the darker landscape beneath but

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.980 
some of the darker landscape beneath but
I<00:03:46.280> think<00:03:46.490> that's<00:03:46.670> about<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.060> says<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.840> quite

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
I think that's about it says it's quite

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.400 
I think that's about it says it's quite
nicely<00:03:48.260> leveled<00:03:48.710> up<00:03:48.830> now<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.990> means<00:03:51.170> I

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
nicely leveled up now and that means I

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.570 
nicely leveled up now and that means I
can<00:03:52.120> start<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.360> edit<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> photo<00:03:54.530> as<00:03:55.070> a

can start to edit the photo as a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.990 
can start to edit the photo as a
completely<00:03:56.210> properly<00:03:56.780> exposed<00:03:57.440> photo<00:03:58.070> so

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
completely properly exposed photo so

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.330 
completely properly exposed photo so
what<00:03:59.210> I'll<00:03:59.300> do<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.510> I'll<00:03:59.720> press<00:03:59.930> four<00:04:00.920> keys<00:04:01.190> at

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
what I'll do is I'll press four keys at

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.870 
what I'll do is I'll press four keys at
the<00:04:01.370> same<00:04:01.430> time<00:04:01.790> patrol<00:04:02.450> shift<00:04:02.990> alt<00:04:03.620> +<00:04:03.980> e<00:04:04.460> on

layers<00:04:11.120> beneath<00:04:11.390> into<00:04:12.050> one<00:04:12.320> so<00:04:13.160> now<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.580> can<00:04:13.670> do

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
layers beneath into one so now I can do

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.750 
layers beneath into one so now I can do

sky<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:58.690> could<00:05:58.840> also<00:05:58.990> use<00:05:59.910> dodge<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.150> burn

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180

technique burning you can burn the

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.770 
technique burning you can burn the
shadows<00:06:06.850> to<00:06:07.240> make<00:06:07.420> those<00:06:07.630> look<00:06:07.900> darker

to add contrast your photo and what you

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.640 
to add contrast your photo and what you
can<00:06:23.650> find<00:06:23.860> if<00:06:24.040> you<00:06:24.160> zoom<00:06:24.190> in<00:06:24.670> if<00:06:25.450> you<00:06:25.870> do<00:06:26.620> a

can find if you zoom in if you do a

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.000 
can find if you zoom in if you do a
little<00:06:26.830> bit<00:06:27.070> too<00:06:27.340> much<00:06:27.580> editing<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:29.010> do

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
little bit too much editing to do

little bit too much editing to do
anything<00:06:30.430> you<00:06:30.550> think<00:06:30.700> it<00:06:30.970> can<00:06:31.150> get<00:06:31.300> kind<00:06:31.540> of

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
anything you think it can get kind of

anything you think it can get kind of
kind<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.140> a<00:06:32.200> course<00:06:32.530> effect<00:06:33.010> might<00:06:33.790> not<00:06:33.820> be

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
kind of a course effect might not be

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.150 
kind of a course effect might not be

become<00:06:36.280> a<00:06:36.400> little<00:06:36.490> bit<00:06:36.790> grainy<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.420> what<00:06:37.870> I

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
become a little bit grainy and what I

become a little bit grainy and what I
often<00:06:38.140> do<00:06:38.530> is<00:06:38.710> I<00:06:38.830> use<00:06:40.320> filter<00:06:41.880> blur<00:06:43.290> surface

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
