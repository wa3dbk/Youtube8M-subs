00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.430 

the<00:01:08.620> hub<00:01:08.800> guard<00:01:09.390> right<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.110> then<00:01:11.320> it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
the hub guard right on and then it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.399 
the hub guard right on and then it
slides<00:01:11.650> on

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
slides on

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.499 
slides on
and<00:01:14.219> we're<00:01:14.399> also<00:01:14.549> working<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> bipolar

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and we're also working on the bipolar

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
and we're also working on the bipolar
peg<00:01:15.899> so<00:01:16.560> what's<00:01:16.740> gonna<00:01:16.860> happen<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.490> you've<00:01:17.729> got

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
peg so what's gonna happen is you've got

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
peg so what's gonna happen is you've got
an<00:01:17.939> aluminum<00:01:18.119> core<00:01:18.539> which<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.110> come<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
an aluminum core which will come with a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310 
an aluminum core which will come with a
plastic<00:01:20.039> sleeve<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.079> switch

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
plastic sleeve and if you want to switch

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
plastic sleeve and if you want to switch
out<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> crow<00:01:23.009> Molly<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
out to a crow Molly will have the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.859 
out to a crow Molly will have the
bipolar<00:01:24.689> chromoly<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> buy<00:01:26.869> sleeves

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
bipolar chromoly and you can buy sleeves

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.340 
bipolar chromoly and you can buy sleeves
separate<00:01:28.880> that'll<00:01:29.880> slide<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.259> it's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
separate that'll slide right on so it's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
separate that'll slide right on so it's
basically<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:32.039> aluminum<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.850> chromoly

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
basically an aluminum and a chromoly

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
basically an aluminum and a chromoly
option<00:01:33.899> with<00:01:34.890> interchangeable<00:01:35.250> sleeves<00:01:36.500> then

up this is the elite bird face on a lead
we<00:03:55.400> did<00:03:55.580> one<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.940> was<00:03:56.030> based<00:03:56.210> on<00:03:56.300> many<00:03:56.540> hub

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.630 

protesting<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.109> it'd<00:04:00.200> be<00:04:00.230> more<00:04:00.409> adorable

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.400 

quite<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.240> bit<00:04:04.390> goes<00:04:04.570> into<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:04.960> it's<00:04:05.230> not<00:04:05.350> just

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
quite a bit goes into this it's not just

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.430 
quite a bit goes into this it's not just
your<00:04:06.270> master<00:04:07.270> sample<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.630> think<00:04:07.870> everything<00:04:08.350> is

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
your master sample I think everything is

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.610 
your master sample I think everything is
