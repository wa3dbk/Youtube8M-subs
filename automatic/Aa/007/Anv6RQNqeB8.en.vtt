00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
far as triathlons go the first thing to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.690 
far as triathlons go the first thing to
determine<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.190> why<00:00:35.309> they're<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.520> be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
determine is why they're gonna be

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
determine is why they're gonna be
putting<00:00:35.910> socks<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.750> run<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.260> because

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
putting socks on the run or not because

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.530 
putting socks on the run or not because
if<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.969> somewhat<00:00:39.270> irrelevant

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
if you are then it's somewhat irrelevant

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.209 
if you are then it's somewhat irrelevant
you<00:00:39.870> might<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.500> socks<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> bike

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you might as well put socks for the bike

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
you might as well put socks for the bike
and<00:00:41.460> keep<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> run<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:43.110> not

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and keep it on the run if you're not

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.690 
and keep it on the run if you're not
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.649> putting<00:00:43.950> socks<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> run

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
going to be putting socks on the run

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
going to be putting socks on the run
then<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.320> important<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.160> consider

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then it will be important to consider

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
then it will be important to consider
the<00:00:48.090> fit<00:00:48.600> without<00:00:48.899> socks<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.920> buying<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the fit without socks when buying a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
the fit without socks when buying a
cycling<00:00:50.850> shoe<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.840> fit<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.260> change

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
cycling shoe because the fit can change

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
cycling shoe because the fit can change
and<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.399> most<00:00:53.610> triathletes<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and what most triathletes will do is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
and what most triathletes will do is
that<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.620> thinking<00:00:56.399> about<00:00:56.699> wearing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that if you are thinking about wearing

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
that if you are thinking about wearing
shoes<00:00:57.570> without<00:00:57.840> socks<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.430> may

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
shoes without socks is that they may

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
shoes without socks is that they may
wear<00:00:59.940> thin<00:01:00.359> socks<00:01:00.750> during<00:01:01.170> training<00:01:01.770> rides

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
wear thin socks during training rides

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
wear thin socks during training rides
and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.030> sockless<00:01:03.629> during<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> race<00:01:04.290> are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and then go sockless during a race are

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.020 
and then go sockless during a race are
some<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> shoes<00:01:05.369> made<00:01:05.640> slightly

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
some of the shoes made slightly

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
some of the shoes made slightly
differently<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> accommodate<00:01:06.930> sockless<00:01:07.799> wear

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
differently to accommodate sockless wear

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
differently to accommodate sockless wear
yes<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.540> again<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
yes they are and again back to the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
yes they are and again back to the
triathlon<00:01:11.760> shoes<00:01:12.200> most<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> triathlon

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
triathlon shoes most of the triathlon

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.270 
triathlon shoes most of the triathlon
shoes<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.580> gonna<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:15.259> seamless<00:01:16.280> interior

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
shoes are gonna have seamless interior

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.240 
shoes are gonna have seamless interior
or<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:18.509> put<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.770> thought<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
or they put a little bit more thought in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
or they put a little bit more thought in
the<00:01:20.369> interior<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.119> reduce<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> number<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the interior to reduce the number of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
the interior to reduce the number of
seams<00:01:23.040> rough<00:01:23.580> edges<00:01:23.880> etc<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
seams rough edges etc so that you can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.840 
seams rough edges etc so that you can
wear<00:01:26.640> sockless<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.780> less<00:01:28.080> friction

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
wear sockless and have less friction

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
wear sockless and have less friction
again<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> wearing<00:01:31.020> shoes<00:01:31.340> wearing

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
again this is wearing shoes wearing

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
again this is wearing shoes wearing
cycling<00:01:32.759> shoes<00:01:32.939> without<00:01:33.119> socks<00:01:33.299> may<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.079> be

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
cycling shoes without socks may not be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
cycling shoes without socks may not be
for<00:01:34.500> everybody<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:36.119> some<00:01:36.420> point<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.840> need

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
for everybody and at some point you need

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
for everybody and at some point you need
to<00:01:37.110> decide<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.710> comfort<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.549> important

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to decide if comfort is more important

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.640 
to decide if comfort is more important
than<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.299> extra<00:01:39.810> ten<00:01:40.020> seconds<00:01:40.530> in

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
than that extra ten seconds in

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
than that extra ten seconds in
transition<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> important<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> kind

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
transition but it is important to kind

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
transition but it is important to kind
of<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.070> idea<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.880> you're<00:01:45.060> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
of have an idea which way you're going

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
of have an idea which way you're going
to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.479> before<00:01:46.079> purchasing<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> proper<00:01:47.490> pair

to go before purchasing the proper pair
of<00:01:47.759> shoes<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.290> try<00:01:49.590> them<00:01:49.829> on

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of shoes because if you do try them on

in the store with big thick socks then

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
in the store with big thick socks then
it's<00:01:53.130> gonna<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.520> very<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:54.060> challenging<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it's gonna be very very challenging to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.929 
it's gonna be very very challenging to
be<00:01:55.020> wear<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> same<00:01:55.530> shoe<00:01:55.829> without<00:01:56.130> socks<00:01:56.670> or
