last 24 hours we see the cause of the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.370 
last 24 hours we see the cause of the
second<00:02:05.159> storm<00:02:05.369> came<00:02:05.700> faster<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> whole<00:02:07.200> day

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
second storm came faster but a whole day

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.339 
second storm came faster but a whole day
later<00:02:07.680> aka<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> same<00:02:09.209> event<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.170> see

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
later aka not the same event you can see

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.050 
later aka not the same event you can see
that<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.619> soho's<00:02:11.009> three-day<00:02:11.370> solar<00:02:11.640> wind<00:02:11.879> data

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.430 
that on soho's three-day solar wind data
as<00:02:12.270> well<00:02:12.450> where<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> second<00:02:13.110> event

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
as well where the second event

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
as well where the second event
speedier<00:02:13.890> yet<00:02:14.130> managed<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:15.060> later

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
speedier yet managed to get here later

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.450 
speedier yet managed to get here later
that's<00:02:15.990> because<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> second<00:02:16.770> impact<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
that's because the second impact was the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.310 
that's because the second impact was the
