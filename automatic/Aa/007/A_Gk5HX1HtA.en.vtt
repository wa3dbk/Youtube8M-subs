hello guys what's up is it here and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.180 
hello guys what's up is it here and
today<00:00:02.810> I'm<00:00:03.139> going<00:00:03.199> to<00:00:03.469> do<00:00:03.679> a<00:00:03.709> quick<00:00:03.800> unboxing

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
today I'm going to do a quick unboxing

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.150 
today I'm going to do a quick unboxing
of<00:00:04.700> SSR<00:00:05.330> tea<00:00:05.540> and<00:00:05.810> one<00:00:06.020> for<00:00:06.200> you<00:00:06.380> HP<00:00:06.740> high<00:00:06.920> power

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
of SSR tea and one for you HP high power

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.120 
of SSR tea and one for you HP high power
out<00:00:07.370> so<00:00:08.060> this<00:00:08.720> is<00:00:08.750> not<00:00:09.020> just<00:00:09.260> a<00:00:09.350> regular<00:00:09.769> outer

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
out so this is not just a regular outer

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.730 
out so this is not just a regular outer
it<00:00:10.490> can<00:00:10.670> be<00:00:10.820> access<00:00:11.450> point<00:00:11.660> or<00:00:11.809> H<00:00:12.050> extender<00:00:12.559> so

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
it can be access point or H extender so

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.190 
it can be access point or H extender so
let's<00:00:13.640> take<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.820> quick<00:00:14.059> look<00:00:14.090> at<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.510> features

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
let's take a quick look at the features

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.140 
let's take a quick look at the features
here<00:00:15.759> zoom<00:00:16.759> in<00:00:17.050> alright<00:00:18.050> okay<00:00:18.820> with<00:00:19.820> the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
here zoom in alright okay with the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.899 
here zoom in alright okay with the
drought<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:20.869> capable<00:00:21.499> of<00:00:21.589> creating<00:00:22.369> for

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
drought is capable of creating for

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.409 
drought is capable of creating for
different<00:00:23.390> SSID<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.349> for<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.159> gas<00:00:25.819> access<00:00:26.179> and

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
different SSID so for the gas access and

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.880 
different SSID so for the gas access and
the<00:00:27.249> next<00:00:28.249> is<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.489> rotor<00:00:28.909> apec<00:00:29.569> switch<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.859> you

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the next is a rotor apec switch so you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.180 
the next is a rotor apec switch so you
can<00:00:31.310> easily<00:00:31.519> switch<00:00:31.880> from<00:00:32.449> AP<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.500> router<00:00:33.800> one

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
can easily switch from AP to router one

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.860 
can easily switch from AP to router one
and<00:00:35.620> ssai<00:00:36.620> cloud<00:00:37.149> which<00:00:38.149> means<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.629> can

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
and ssai cloud which means you can

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.709 
and ssai cloud which means you can
synchronize<00:00:39.859> your<00:00:39.890> files<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.760> data<00:00:41.120> from

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
synchronize your files and data from

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.869 
synchronize your files and data from
your<00:00:42.469> computer<00:00:43.010> wirelessly<00:00:43.820> using<00:00:43.969> its<00:00:44.390> rotor

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
feature standard SS packaging and we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.600 
feature standard SS packaging and we
have<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.720> spec<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:33.070> alright<00:01:34.070> without

this the Quick Start menu guy yeah so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.990 
this the Quick Start menu guy yeah so
let's<00:02:20.680> take<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.890> look<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> router<00:02:21.459> itself

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.010 

all<00:02:31.000> right<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:32.020> we<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:34.920> oops<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.989> is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
all right there we go oops so this is

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.640 
all right there we go oops so this is
the<00:02:38.140> router<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.700> plain<00:02:40.120> black<00:02:41.819> yeah<00:02:42.819> and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the router just plain black yeah and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.790 
the router just plain black yeah and
let's<00:02:44.650> look<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:45.430> look<00:02:45.550> at<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.760> back<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
let's look just look at the back of it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.500 
let's look just look at the back of it
all<00:02:47.800> right<00:02:48.569> there<00:02:49.569> we<00:02:49.840> go<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:51.459> don't<00:02:52.299> know<00:02:52.390> if

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
all right there we go I don't know if

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.559 
all right there we go I don't know if
you<00:02:52.660> guys<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:52.989> see<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.299> pretty

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
you guys can see this but this is pretty

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.650 
you guys can see this but this is pretty
obvious<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.370> antenna<00:02:57.420> doping<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
obvious the antenna doping for the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.580 
obvious the antenna doping for the
antenna<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.660> power<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.470> power

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
antenna and this is the power the power

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.250 
antenna and this is the power the power
switch<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:05.319> SE<00:03:05.860> conectar<00:03:07.560> USB<00:03:08.560> part<00:03:10.260> 1

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
switch and the SE conectar USB part 1

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.650 
switch and the SE conectar USB part 1
part<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:13.049> LAN<00:03:14.049> port<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.430> think<00:03:15.670> that's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
part and for LAN port so I think that's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.480 
part and for LAN port so I think that's
all<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.110> unboxing<00:03:17.319> today<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:19.000> cow
