00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.560
 sadness because these wanted to be inconsistent 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.240
 is 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.960
 it's a fantastic part of which I'm happy about 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.349
 but having been installed a bmv because it is anyway 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.960
 probably the technology 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.590
 hidden inside the soul of this bolide has saved me in two or three 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.569
 occasions 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:27.219
 but it's really a wonderful bike and feel the thrust 

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.329
 from the king still on the body 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.960
 it is something that frankly I had forgotten to be so beautiful then 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 I'm very happy it is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.130
 I hope there will be an opportunity to make a second episode 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.650
 and in truth when using the helmet visor is not that 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.960
 I love to think of nothing else but to concentrate on trying not to do 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.940
 nonsense because in any case at the end of the straight line you touch 260 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.480
 then three kilometers then 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 n is nice to go to cannon quickly things at that speed 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.450
 rm 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.610
 if you want a little 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.239
 common denominator with how how 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.610
 inside the passenger compartment of racing cars that is to leave the emotions a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.660
 back even if there are crumbs with the year 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.600
 you actually learn to ignore them by simply focusing on what you smoke 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.800
 you have to do more 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.660
 as far as the controls that have been installed on this bike are concerned 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.200
 ie they were incredibly precise enough it was boston photomatic or 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 round 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.160
 so assimilate them immediately anyway 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.420
 away it was not an exercise 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.910
 so simple 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.670
 and therefore 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 I had several things about which 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.899
 stay focused however told this in a corner of my mind 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 there was alessandro parodi he had like a madman 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 I believe that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.540
 not just a thing like this sea 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.280
 all the things that govern our existence 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 very often we find ourselves facing difficulties that can even in some 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.890
 way to discourage 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.249
 more easily the people who do not have 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.910
 induced what I thought it was born with 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.610
 if the undersigned will do it if you don't try not 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.999
 you'll never have an answer somos e monti asks the question then 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.979
 he makes an attempt so many times we realize that in truth 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:33.279
 you weren't even that complex i think this is a classic case 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.660
 classic demonstration that if you really want something 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.579
 just strive to reason 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.809
 in compensating for your lack of traverses of residual talents that later 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:48.329
 having in my case the hands have been moved to the handlebar 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.859
 obvious though 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.889
 this type of exercise done on the track to everything is absolutely 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.649
 enough 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:59.379
 because in any case there are no traffic lights timing I have not taken the 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.499
 classic or sunny and I didn't need to set foot on the ground 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.689
 logical that today we had the luxury of being able to run on the track and then 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.790
 we thought only harp to handle the bike at speed takes about 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:16.879
 for 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.659
 incito anyway I make an invitation anyway to all guys who maybe 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.909
 we want to make a first attempt to do it in a place where 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.409
 thought for the purpose now if there is not really a track at least one 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.609
 parking to make sure that if something should go wrong 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.989
 in short, at least he gets mad 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.969
 then only one part at a time does not look 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.139
 to run into consequences that can be the most serious not only for itself 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.329
 themselves but also for others
