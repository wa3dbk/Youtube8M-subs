00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.720 
wrap the graphics color right there and
I'll<00:00:18.119> full<00:00:18.630> gigabyte<00:00:19.820> g.skill<00:00:20.820> memory<00:00:21.210> ram

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
I'll full gigabyte g.skill memory ram

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.720 
I'll full gigabyte g.skill memory ram
and<00:00:23.779> here<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.900> got<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> antec<00:00:25.710> 900<00:00:26.369> k<00:00:28.730> let's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and here we got the antec 900 k let's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.889 
and here we got the antec 900 k let's
take<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.949> the<00:00:31.949> components<00:00:32.279> first

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
take a look at all the components first

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.549 
take a look at all the components first
like<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.050> said<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.890> G<00:00:35.070> scale<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.610> gigabyte

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559

antec 900 k so that's pretty much it and
I'm<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.459> will<00:02:19.180> probably<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:21.100> making<00:02:21.459> an

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
I'm I will probably be making an

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.199 
I'm I will probably be making an
unboxing<00:02:22.000> video<00:02:23.220> alls<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.150> of

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
unboxing video alls I'm just kind of

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.440 
unboxing video alls I'm just kind of
running<00:02:25.720> cut<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.610> well<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.670> install

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
running cut right to the well I install

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.190 
running cut right to the well I install
all<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.690> components<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.739> case<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> yeah

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
all the components to the case so yeah

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.920 
all the components to the case so yeah
I'm<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.440> gonna<00:02:32.650> do<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.160> tune<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.519> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.470 

since<00:02:37.859> um<00:02:38.280> I'm<00:02:39.239> finished<00:02:39.719> installing<00:02:40.079> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
since um I'm finished installing the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.420 
since um I'm finished installing the
everything<00:02:42.480> went<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.930> take<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.560> multiple<00:02:44.400> of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
everything went to go take a multiple of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.959 
everything went to go take a multiple of
the<00:02:44.700> CPU<00:02:45.180> graph<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.140> cause<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:47.519> fine<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
the CPU graph is cause I was fine and

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:56.149 
the CPU graph is cause I was fine and
I'll<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:54.060> right<00:02:54.090> hand<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> LG<00:02:55.530> optical

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
I'll do right hand with the LG optical

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.009 
I'll do right hand with the LG optical
drive<00:02:57.109> that's<00:02:58.109> pretty<00:02:58.319> basic<00:02:59.599> now<00:03:00.599> let's<00:03:00.840> take

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
drive that's pretty basic now let's take

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.319 
drive that's pretty basic now let's take
a<00:03:01.079> look<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.560> inside<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.219> case<00:03:05.329> because

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
a look at the inside of the case because

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.420 
a look at the inside of the case because
our<00:03:06.569> look<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> best<00:03:07.859> cable

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
our look it's not the best cable

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.759 
our look it's not the best cable
management<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.049> long<00:03:10.439> as<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
management but you know long as the

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.470 
management but you know long as the
works<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> matters<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> on

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
works that's all the matters and on

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.740 
works that's all the matters and on
these<00:03:16.319> cables<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:17.450> extremely<00:03:18.450> small<00:03:18.689> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
these cables are extremely small and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
these cables are extremely small and
that's<00:03:19.049> why<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.639> was<00:03:20.639> unable<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:22.189> put<00:03:23.189> all<00:03:23.310> these

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
that's why I was unable to put all these

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.550 
that's why I was unable to put all these
cables<00:03:23.909> behind<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.359> case<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.959> Google<00:03:25.379> call

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
cables behind the case or Google call

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.780 
cables behind the case or Google call
out<00:03:25.709> better<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.310> cleaner<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:28.590> yeah<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:29.639> know

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
out better and cleaner but yeah you know

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.209 
out better and cleaner but yeah you know
it<00:03:29.939> is<00:03:30.060> what<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:32.030> got<00:03:33.030> some<00:03:33.540> stock<00:03:33.840> fan

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
it is what it is I got some stock fan

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.280 
it is what it is I got some stock fan
pretty<00:03:35.219> basic<00:03:35.430> tool<00:03:35.879> but<00:03:36.120> I'm<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.200> be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
pretty basic tool but I'm going to be
