 the truth 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.270
 I've taken the trouble to get 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.130
 I've seen several comments on 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.520
 internet that say that the textual brand 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.110
 It is a very good brand quite 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.630
 economic and so I decided to buy it 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.270
 to see if it's true 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.750

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.550

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.310
 duration since it lasts quite 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.640

 and good as what the box pretty 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.360
 elegant of my taste 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.850
 good as you can see when opening the box 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.970
 we found what is the tablet of 10 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.970
 inches 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
 good as you can see we stopped with this 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.760
 single table that is the front camera 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.189
 vga 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.879
 the capacitive 10-inch screen 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.879
 multi touch 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 in the back we will find what 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.180
 which is the touchpad brand the model 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.420
 the speakers 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.090
 and the 2 megapixel rear camera with 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.520
 pretty good flash 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.750
 on this side we find what is 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.520
 the slot for microsd the port for 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.050
 load it from 5 balls 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.050
 the entrance to mini usb 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.459
 the hdmi port and the 3.5 input 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 millimeters for the hearing aids in this 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.480
 another part we find what is the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.540
 button on and off the keys 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.939
 of volume more and less 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.030
 and good is what we will see here in the 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.030
 West 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.420
 well in the box we will find what is 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.350
 the little bag where the tablet was going 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:40.060
 the cable vtr or axis forgiveness where we can 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.240
 connect a mouse or keyboard to our 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.520
 tablet 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.200
 we remove this from here we find what 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.200
 it's the typical manual that nobody reads 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.209
 earphones are pretty 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.920
 cheap but it's already an advantage that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.430
 bring as some tablets that do not 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.330
 they bring nothing that the truth because nobody 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.319
 use and they go to the garbage we find what 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.650
 which is the usb cable to load the time 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.420
 and transfer data we found the policy 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.030
 guarantee 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.000
 and the five-bag wall charger 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.350
 and that's all we find here 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.150
 as I repeat I is already 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.650
 using the tablet during the course of 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.760
 day and the truth that has left me a good 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.760
 taste of mouth up is very 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.760
 customized 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.110
 as you can see it has a big screen 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.110
 which is pretty good high definition 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.770
 you can be good 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.430
 stable economic has a 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.030
 Android 4.2 or beta operating system 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.030
 I'm going to show 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.420
 as you can see a trick of all already 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.420
 from the factory 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.610
 the truth is that it's a pretty tablet 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.550
 good in the course of the day has not 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.240
 given no problem has a cost of 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.430
 thousand nine hundred and two thousand pesos that the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.390
 true then for a tablet of 10 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.070
 inch HD is pretty good 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.870
 a description of the video I leave my 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.570
 facebook page where I will be uploading 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.540
 images taken with the rear camera and 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.060
 the front camera and so for it to 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.340
 a 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.660
 in another upcoming video can be a 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.330
 complete analysis of what you can and 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.819
 It can not be done on this tablet 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.979
 how he has run the games and all that 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.889
 that in my opinion loose those that have 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:54.879
 tested goes pretty well good with nothing 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:57.699
 more than say ah by the way it has 8 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.860
 gigas but as you will know that never 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.940
 we have 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.070
 complete 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.050
 says that it brings 8 gigas so if it brings them 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.889
 but it's divided for the user one 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.889
 6 mesh left 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.240
 already included are the raml does not arrive 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.340
 of the processor and you can see you're left 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.520
 a little to the user but still 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.530
 you can put a microsd card of what 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.840
 that you want and then of the amount that 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.610
 want 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.230
 because this has been everything I hope that you 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.190
 have liked to see you in the next 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.780
