00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.930
 in terms of YouTube today we are going to 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:21.520
 do the review the unboxing of an imac 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.900
 27-inch once to the machine in 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.510
 my opinion I 'll give you my opinion 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.940
 staff about this wonder 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.050
 and nothing we will see how it works 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.050
 so good now 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.510
 as well 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.989
 all right 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.989
 and here we have the first view 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.070
 where do we meet 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.079
 I guess he wants to come the keyboard with 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.039
 a previous experience 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.039
 keyboard and mouse 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.580
 well let's see 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.730
 what 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 or 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.720
 and nothing 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.990
 conventional and wireless and to all 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.979
 Models 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.979
 even those who are like that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.440
 are bad 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440
 why 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.300
 the small world fast installation 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.560
 and the stickers 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.329
 to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.070
 Well let's do something that we also 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.070
 the team is interested in here 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.300
 and we are going to uncover 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.609
 plastic brings a protector 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.840
 also 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 and a little more here 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.489
 good but it's already 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 you could tell it was then let's see 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.820
 we have a small plastic 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.830
 we can already see that it is very 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.670
 thin 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.120
 we see a part 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.120
 fair 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.370
 ah 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.370
 by the seal 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 we are this peak force 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.600
 the abbot 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.600
 How am I 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.590
 in this project 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.280
 and I do not know if you can see it here is its 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.849
 Power button on 4 USB ports 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.470
 2 ports thunderbolt a port of 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.880
 ethernet 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.140
 headphone output headphones 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.110
 here is for cards 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.450
 card reader I do not know exactly 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.610
 how the card reader pains for 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.650
 that model but it is a card reader 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.280
 logically that we do not have a DVD player 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.140
 and we do not have any of that is let's say 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 very thin 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.099
 Charles 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.099
 in santa more or less thin that is 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.560
 and good guys we skip a bit what 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.459
 what was it 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.380
 the first the first turn on and already 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.870
 you know what brings your configurations of 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.720
 welcome languages that gives you the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.510
 system to the user not to do so 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.350
 long series of organs and first one 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.570
 moment we notice the screen and the system 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 which for my taste is one of the best 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.440
 systems or good up right now is the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.040
 better system than apple has 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:45.919
 mavericks 10.9 if we get some 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.919
 specifications of the imac as such 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.030
 the operating system is a mavericks 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.220
 10.9 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.530
 in this specific model has 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.250
 3.2 processor arrives exercises between 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:09.420
 the core i5 8 gb of memory of 1600 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.020
 megadrive ddr3 to put more 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.020
 information 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:23.240
 we have nvidia or nvidia graphics not 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.620
 I know how I want to read geforce gts 755 m 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.620
 1 gb 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.420
 do not 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.560
 and maybe model 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.660
 at the end of 2013 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.510
 at the end of 2000 pesos that means 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.639
 that is to this day that I think 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.830
 that the conference of the double 2000 of 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.040
 CD 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.600
 of apple and today they are going to present to be 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.850
 as an area that will present new 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.460
 models to date this is the model 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.780
 more recent there is another configuration 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.650
 just 27 inches that is a bit more 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.280
 More expensive 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:09.570
 talking about money yes but this model 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.980
 it's awesome awesome guys in 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:16.390
 this part 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:21.010
 that we have of the system using 1% or 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:24.010
 2% of the complete system active 98 per 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.460
 hundred means that our 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.240
 processor 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.580
 is not basically being used and in the 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.360
 first fired we have 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.230
 we have a memory consumption of 2.06 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:43.720
 gigabytes of ram 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.170
 leaving us with a little more than 5 gigas of 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.409
 memory 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.219
 free 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:53.420
 a little more than 5 gb of free memory a 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:57.250
 last detail let's put them there 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.250
 to see more humans 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.379
 s 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.810
 so that it is more or less the size 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:09.500
 the size difference there is to not 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.530
 be so long is the video 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:16.070
 if you have any questions and I can 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.750
 answer it gladly do not have 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.870
 the least doubt that we are going to 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.590
 answer, leave your questions in the 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.240
 comments 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.550
 any opinion any doubt they have and 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.800
 We will gladly answer what 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.910
 this was all said goodbye to you your 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.910
 friend leonard
