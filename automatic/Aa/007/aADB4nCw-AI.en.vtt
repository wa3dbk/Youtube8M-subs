it into the downloads folder you just

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
it into the downloads folder you just
need<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.570> exactly<00:01:12.810> where<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.470> later

for<00:01:14.369> step<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.950> clockworkmod

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

now<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.299> order<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> need<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
now in order to do this you need to have

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
now in order to do this you need to have
an<00:01:19.799> unlocked<00:01:20.689> bootloader<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.770> a

an unlocked bootloader on and a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
an unlocked bootloader on and a
completely<00:01:23.430> stock<00:01:23.759> recovery<00:01:24.380> installed<00:01:25.380> on

completely stock recovery installed on

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.560 
completely stock recovery installed on
it<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.000> booting<00:01:27.360> into

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it but we will be booting into

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.749 
it but we will be booting into
clockworkmod<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> exact<00:01:29.579> same

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
clockworkmod it's not the exact same

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
clockworkmod it's not the exact same
thing<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.170> can't<00:01:31.409> have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
thing you need that you can't have

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
thing you need that you can't have
clockworkmod<00:01:32.360> replace<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> stock<00:01:34.170> recovery

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
clockworkmod replace the stock recovery

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
clockworkmod replace the stock recovery
because<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.579> need<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> stock<00:01:36.060> recovery

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
because you need the stock recovery

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
because you need the stock recovery
files<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.079> upload<00:01:37.409> update<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.509> package<00:01:40.159> Clark

booting<00:01:41.759> into<00:01:41.970> clockworkmod<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> little

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
booting into clockworkmod is a little

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.940 
booting into clockworkmod is a little
bit<00:01:43.229> different<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bit different because now you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
bit different because now you
essentially<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.149> recoveries<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
essentially have two recoveries on the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950 
essentially have two recoveries on the
phone<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.850> once<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.090> reboot<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> phone

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
phone and once you reboot the phone

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
phone and once you reboot the phone
clockworkmod<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.829> no<00:01:49.979> longer<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
clockworkmod is no longer there it's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.139 
clockworkmod is no longer there it's
just<00:01:51.600> temporary<00:01:55.040> recovery<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.280> reason

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just temporary recovery and the reason

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
just temporary recovery and the reason
why<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> directions<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.899> work<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.409> the

then sup overall the I've known some

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.640 
then sup overall the I've known some
improvements<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:37.550> when<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.930> guess<00:05:39.930> drawback

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
improvements the when I guess drawback

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.350 
improvements the when I guess drawback
is<00:05:40.919> that<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:43.070> speed<00:05:44.070> on<00:05:44.400> speedtest.net<00:05:45.030> app

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
is that the speed on speedtest.net app

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.030 
is that the speed on speedtest.net app
is<00:05:46.200> a<00:05:46.700> drastically<00:05:47.700> slither<00:05:48.180> for<00:05:48.510> LTE<00:05:49.010> but<00:05:50.010> I

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
is a drastically slither for LTE but I

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.460 
is a drastically slither for LTE but I
haven't<00:05:50.460> had<00:05:50.669> any<00:05:50.910> issues<00:05:51.150> with<00:05:51.479> like
