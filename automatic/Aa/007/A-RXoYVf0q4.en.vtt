00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.820
 well let's do a demonstration of 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.900
 the matrices 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.850
 to make washers good by 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.850
 example we have this washer 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.260
 the answer has some some 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.260
 dates 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.120
 they are great are die-cutting that is called 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.070
 composite 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.070
 because it makes 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.579
 makes the cut of both external and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.820
 internal in a single blow 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.859
 although we accede clear the internal cut 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.859
 and the external in a single blow 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.860
 If these are the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.870
 the springs 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.610
 the matrix is ​​hit 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.390
 and it is the cut when it passes to the sheet 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.960
 i 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.960
 a boy 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 it's the same exactly the same with the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.550
 springs and this is the die-casting of this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.060
 it would be the matrix holders or the columns 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.060
 today 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.060
 here low this part of the portal 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 matrix with the matrix and short 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.729
 from the puddle 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 with all the external cut as internal 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.050
 he does it alone in one hit 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.050
 ah 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 the ancients 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.550
 and 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.850
 this hit to the seesaw here goes down all 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.700
 this goes down as a spring 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.659
 low and short on materials such as climbing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.659
 isabella 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 these are these are the doors 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.620
 tools say them for the ones they carried 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
 three mechanized states be in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.290
 perfect condition they do not have oxides and the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.540
 sharp are in good condition 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 and this is the characteristic of all 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.829
 matrix of short matrix with columns and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.980
 the matrices here in this is everything 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:37.050
 that is here in the matrixes would be 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.050
 of what we have 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
 Y
