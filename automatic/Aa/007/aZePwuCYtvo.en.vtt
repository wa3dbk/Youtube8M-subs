00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
normal standard sized nib and so you can

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
normal standard sized nib and so you can
imagine<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.320> width<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.980> nib<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> way

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
imagine the width on this nib is way

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
imagine the width on this nib is way
wider<00:00:39.710> than<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> actual<00:00:41.309> detail<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
wider than the actual detail in the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.529 
wider than the actual detail in the
dress<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.829> combat<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.340> problem<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
dress so to combat that problem what you

dress so to combat that problem what you
would<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.530> insert<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
would need to do is just insert the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
would need to do is just insert the
bullet<00:00:47.730> tip<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.329> into<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> fine<00:00:49.050> tip<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
bullet tip right into the fine tip and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
bullet tip right into the fine tip and
give<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.250> good<00:00:50.280> click<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> do

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
give it a really good click now I do

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.380 
give it a really good click now I do
this<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.020> two<00:00:52.199> hands<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.460> within<00:00:53.730> seconds

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this with two hands and within seconds

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.930 
this with two hands and within seconds
your<00:00:54.539> ink<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.410> run<00:00:55.620> through<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
your ink will actually run through now I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
your ink will actually run through now I
have<00:00:57.180> actually<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> earlier<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
have actually put this on earlier so the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
have actually put this on earlier so the
ink<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.219> loaded<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.730> there<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
ink is actually loaded in there but you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.340 
ink is actually loaded in there but you
can<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.620> fine<00:01:01.949> detail<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.059> get

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
can see the fine detail that you can get

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.509 
can see the fine detail that you can get
this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.890> great<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.339> adding

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this is going to be great for adding

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.600 
this is going to be great for adding
patterns<00:01:06.180> onto<00:01:06.630> smaller<00:01:07.110> areas<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.979> also
