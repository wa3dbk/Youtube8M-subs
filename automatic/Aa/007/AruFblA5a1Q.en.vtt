00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.350 

and<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:12.910> have<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:14.410> coming<00:01:14.770> up<00:01:15.210> around<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
and so I have it coming up around the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.500 
and so I have it coming up around the
back<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.780> my<00:01:16.870> shirt<00:01:17.050> dude<00:01:17.440> looks<00:01:17.650> like<00:01:17.950> this

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
back of my shirt dude looks like this

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.920 
back of my shirt dude looks like this
and<00:01:19.510> then<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.560> final<00:01:21.340> step<00:01:21.370> is<00:01:21.610> just<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.240> tie<00:01:22.900> a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
and then the final step is just to tie a

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.570 
and then the final step is just to tie a
bow<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.440> back

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.930 

and<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:28.870> takes<00:01:29.560> any<00:01:30.130> extra<00:01:30.640> fabric

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
and so it just takes any extra fabric

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:40.260 
and so it just takes any extra fabric
t-shirt<00:01:31.870> just<00:01:32.080> makes<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.220> short<00:01:33.370> tighter<00:01:39.270> so

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
t-shirt just makes the short tighter so
