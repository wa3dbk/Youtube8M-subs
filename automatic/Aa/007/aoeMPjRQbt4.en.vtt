actually<00:00:27.660> surprisingly<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.650> quicker<00:00:29.160> than

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually surprisingly a lot quicker than

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually surprisingly a lot quicker than
I<00:00:29.520> thought<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.939> would<00:00:30.059> be<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> let's<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.239> ready

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I thought it would be so let's get ready

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
I thought it would be so let's get ready
to<00:00:33.989> take<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.220> spin<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to take it out for a little spin and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.479 
to take it out for a little spin and
you'll<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.469> bit<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.250> do

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
you'll see a little bit what it can do

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.889

gave me 39 miles an hour when my speedo
read<00:01:29.369> 40<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.740> calibrated<00:01:31.740> pretty<00:01:32.159> well

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
read 40 so it's calibrated pretty well

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
well and as you can see you could go on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.050 
well and as you can see you could go on
backroads<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:40.470> quite<00:01:40.740> well

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
backroads here and do quite well

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.620
