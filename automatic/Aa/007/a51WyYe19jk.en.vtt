all righty well I did say I was going to
do<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.710> fist<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.790> my<00:00:06.540> brand<00:00:07.020> new<00:00:07.140> rebuilt<00:00:07.740> engine

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
do a fist of my brand new rebuilt engine

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.509 
do a fist of my brand new rebuilt engine
video<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.710> go<00:00:10.860> hopefully<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.400> won't

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
video so here we go hopefully I won't

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.610 
video so here we go hopefully I won't
regret<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
regret this

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.800 
regret this
I<00:00:15.260> have<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.830> ignition<00:00:17.250> timing<00:00:17.490> event<00:00:18.119> set<00:00:18.630> up

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I have the ignition timing event set up

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
I have the ignition timing event set up
I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:19.710> right<00:00:20.130> valve

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
I think just about right valve

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.790 
I think just about right valve
clearances<00:00:24.470> 15,000<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> oral<00:00:26.490> pressure<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
clearances 15,000 is oral pressure and I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
clearances 15,000 is oral pressure and I
have<00:00:28.830> cranked<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.310> over<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> few<00:00:29.820> times

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
have cranked it over a few times

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.620 
have cranked it over a few times
obviously<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.380> process<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:33.210> trying<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
obviously in the process of trying to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.530 
obviously in the process of trying to
get<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> ignition<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.940> file<00:00:35.940> counts<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
get the ignition and file counts is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.549 
get the ignition and file counts is
right<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:38.270> I'm<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.420> worried<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.840> anything

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
right so I'm not worried about anything

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.779 
right so I'm not worried about anything
at<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.160> point<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.910> oil<00:00:42.120> pressure<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
at this point of an oil pressure and the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190 
at this point of an oil pressure and the
only<00:00:44.910> end<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> problem<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> I've<00:00:45.899> got

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
only end of the problem that I've got

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
only end of the problem that I've got
here<00:00:47.030> that's<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.690> there

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here that's what I need to see there

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900 
here that's what I need to see there
good<00:00:49.110> old<00:00:49.260> pressure<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.399> other<00:00:50.460> problem<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
good old pressure the other problem of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.939 
good old pressure the other problem of
God<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> ignition<00:00:52.289> switch<00:00:52.469> has

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
God is that the ignition switch has

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.319 
God is that the ignition switch has
shared<00:00:53.489> itself<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
shared itself so I'm going to have to

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.130 
shared itself so I'm going to have to
dodge<00:00:57.329> war<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.460> ignition<00:00:59.460> /<00:01:00.140> electric

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
dodge war in the ignition / electric

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.189 
dodge war in the ignition / electric
fuel<00:01:01.410> pump<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.329> which<00:01:03.329> I've<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.930> figured

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fuel pump here which I've just figured

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.600 
fuel pump here which I've just figured
out<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> last<00:01:04.680> couple<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.250> minutes<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
out in the last couple of minutes so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
out in the last couple of minutes so
here<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> start<00:01:07.140> first

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
here we go we're about to start first

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
here we go we're about to start first
engine<00:01:07.979> start

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
engine start

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 
engine start
attempt<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.600> engine<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.500> alright<00:01:11.250> got

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
attempt first engine start alright got

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
attempt first engine start alright got
ignition<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> hear<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> fuel<00:01:12.960> pump

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
ignition on I can hear the fuel pump

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
ignition on I can hear the fuel pump
running<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> remote<00:01:14.250> starter<00:01:14.820> set<00:01:15.030> up

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
running I've got a remote starter set up

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.140 
running I've got a remote starter set up
so<00:01:15.979> maybe<00:01:16.979> able<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> crank<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> front

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
that might have been the easiest out

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.300 
that might have been the easiest out
I've<00:02:10.360> ever<00:02:10.539> done<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:11.440> first<00:02:11.650> out

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:31.210 

pretty<00:02:16.730> happy<00:02:17.090> with<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.300> Wow<00:02:17.810> even

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.950 

that<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:31.790> prison<00:02:34.390> no<00:02:35.390> pressure<00:02:35.750> is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
that all prison no pressure is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.320 
that all prison no pressure is
rock-solid

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
rock-solid

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.490
