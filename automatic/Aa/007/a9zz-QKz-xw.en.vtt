 2007 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.240
 our starting activity and snowmobiling 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400
 so the organization of hikes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 snowmobiling and it's true that the fact of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 make a starting point with a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 accommodation allowed us to accommodate 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.860
 our snowmobile clientele and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 finally to have an income also to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.930
 the year because we discovered this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.200
 beautiful nature this beautiful landscape of 900 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200
 brigitte 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.780
 we are hungry the most 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.380
 comfortable possible 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.180
 and then we also acquired a spa that 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.280
 is in a location that gives a 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.260
 unobstructed view of the mountains the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.970
 river so it's pretty fabulous I 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.729
 think people appreciate a lot 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.560
 one has access to the river which is a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.390
 other to very interesting was like 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 winter since winter can be 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 go snowshoeing on the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.509
 river also around the cottage so 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.130
 in the surrounding mountains 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.720
 and then of course all the trails 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 pedestrian trunk saint brigitte de 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 laval 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.830
 and which are in general worth almost to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 visitors we have a little bit of everything 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.620
 world finally it's true we 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.810
 works a lot with a clientele 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.180
 European 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.610
 but eventually a lot too maybe 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.220
 more off season or for the purposes of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 week with a Canadian clientele 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 Quebecois so a little all origins 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.850
 finally 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.940
 so we have five rooms so five 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.860
 different rooms from the floor peac3 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.680
 in ground garden so that gives access 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.950
 in the garden they all have a view of 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.950
 mountains 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.680
 what other service at the price move if 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.090
 even in the refuge yes so so the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.220
 people can actually enjoy 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.350
 massage since I have 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.720
 massage therapists who come here 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.360
 massage so different 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.960
 techniques so a great possibility 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.190
 of relaxation and do you believe to finish 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.260
 who the city of saint brigitte de laval 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.330
 realize more about development 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.890
 tourism 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 yes actually I would say of a 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
 generally jacques cartier but 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.820
 actually saint brigitte de laval 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.380
 especially because these last 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.890
 years the development was a lot 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.540
 done at the residential level but so 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.400
 without necessarily taking into account the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.010
 sustainability of access to the trails etc 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.500
 and that's very important to keep 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.209
 to actually attract tourists 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.260
 when we see this beautiful nature the 11th ' 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.630
 my god but it must be that people 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.340
 come see it and including in 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.430
 period of colors that's all 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.060
 beauty but withdrawal thanks a lot of 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.620

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.620

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.159

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.480
 log cabin nature 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.819
 exceptional and the warm welcome 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 of its owners make the place 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.069
 a place of predilection for Saint 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.069
