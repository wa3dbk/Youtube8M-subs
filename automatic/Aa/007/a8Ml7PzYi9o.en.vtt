00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.429
 and the lord again 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.720
 to my magic tricks for that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.240
 we need to impose the normal 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:19.619
 with him or anybody 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 and a toothpick like this normal 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.920
 and we are going to put it then to bring a little 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 here if yes we will put it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.309
 here in the center 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 and then in a little bit we're going to start 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.870
 Roll spoon supported not reach 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.500
 roll up 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.390
 rogen rÃ¶ntgen radiology 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.540
 roll it up and it would contain the patient is 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.540
 on the roll let's proceed to look for the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.830
 stick where is where is the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.070
 home and this is coming to take out the toothpick 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.269
 so they can see who is here 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.150
 because I am here 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.120
 producing what they should take 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.380
 and I'm going to break it 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.409
 listen to the click 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.890
 a stick that is broken would not 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.640
 this 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.990
 see that it is not broken I would not do this and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.460
 this now we are going to develop and measure 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.680
 that the stick 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.680
 still intact 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.720
 this trick is very easy before 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.500
 now the explanation is before 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.170
 the students trick starts 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.479
 and also 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.479
 I'm going to look for a polygon 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.220
 before the trick without anyone seeing you 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.710
 it's a stick in espartales lieutenant is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.930
 a rag 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.420
 with the edge known as skiing 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.210
 and the known size inside this web 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.350
 with everything if you stick a stick here 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.350
 by the edge like this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.370
 I always have a lot of possibility and the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.819
 another stick you put it in the center in 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.170
 Rolls rolls well rotates 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.719
 and when in proceeding to look for the toothpick 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.120
 the stick you put in at the beginning is 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.490
 completely see what is this and what 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 bankruptcies 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.120
 A) Yes 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.640
 what bankrupt 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:46.050
 and then developments in rolls the country 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.040
 this stick is still intact but this is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.550
 the one that is broken and the nascar pulled it out 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.550
 to see 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.030
 this this 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.750
 look 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.940
