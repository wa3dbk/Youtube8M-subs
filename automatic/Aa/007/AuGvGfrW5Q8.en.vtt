could<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.250> kill<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.940> probably<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.300> the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
could not kill I was probably like the

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.660 
could not kill I was probably like the
only<00:03:51.660> person<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.260> could<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> kill<00:03:52.890> so

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
only person that could get a kill so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.759 
only person that could get a kill so
there<00:03:54.630> was<00:03:54.780> definitely<00:03:54.810> something<00:03:55.350> going<00:03:55.650> on

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
get on the same map he's like hey I felt

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.660 
get on the same map he's like hey I felt
I<00:04:33.260> went<00:04:33.500> right<00:04:33.680> through<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.920> map<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.400> he's

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
I went right through the map and he's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.310 
I went right through the map and he's
like<00:04:34.850> oh<00:04:35.000> look<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.510> select<00:04:35.810> team<00:04:35.930> made<00:04:36.140> four

like oh look the select team made four
went<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.620> map<00:04:36.800> he's<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:37.580> I'm<00:04:37.700> finding

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
went to the map he's like I'm finding

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.540 
went to the map he's like I'm finding
out<00:04:38.270> there's<00:04:38.570> there's<00:04:39.320> holes<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.130> mean

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
out there's there's holes so I mean

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.640 
out there's there's holes so I mean
there<00:04:41.270> could<00:04:41.420> be<00:04:41.450> holes<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.170> map<00:04:42.380> and

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
there could be holes in the map and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.630 
there could be holes in the map and
obviously<00:04:43.780> dice<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:45.110> working<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:45.800> patching

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
obviously dice is working on patching

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.870 
obviously dice is working on patching
the<00:04:46.730> bugs<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.890> they<00:04:49.250> know<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.490> there's

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
the bugs and and they know that there's

bugs<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.390> hiccups<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.900> mean<00:04:51.170> right<00:04:51.440> as<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:52.010> see

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
bugs and hiccups I mean right as you see

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.160 
bugs and hiccups I mean right as you see
in<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.370> game<00:04:52.520> plan<00:04:52.790> I'm<00:04:52.970> back<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.690> using<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
in this game plan I'm back to using the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.020 
in this game plan I'm back to using the
l85<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.040> I'm<00:04:55.100> starting<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.490> really<00:04:55.730> like<00:04:56.000> it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
l85 and I'm starting to really like it

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.480 
l85 and I'm starting to really like it
it's<00:04:57.020> taking<00:04:57.200> me<00:04:57.410> something<00:04:57.830> used<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
it's taking me something used to the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.030 
it's taking me something used to the
upward<00:04:58.820> recoil<00:04:59.060> is<00:04:59.570> very<00:05:00.050> easy<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.470> manage

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
upward recoil is very easy to manage

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.340 
upward recoil is very easy to manage
I<00:05:01.070> just<00:05:01.550> gotta<00:05:01.760> learn<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.210> used<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.110> does

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
I just gotta learn to used to it it does

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.400 
I just gotta learn to used to it it does
rock<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> lot<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.670> sights<00:05:05.330> move<00:05:05.600> around<00:05:05.810> but

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
rock a lot the sights move around but

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.440 
rock a lot the sights move around but
the<00:05:06.530> hipfire<00:05:06.920> on<00:05:07.040> this<00:05:07.160> thing<00:05:07.310> is<00:05:07.490> becoming

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
the hipfire on this thing is becoming

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.670 
the hipfire on this thing is becoming
pretty<00:05:08.990> nice<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.930> recently<00:05:11.930> finding<00:05:12.470> out

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
pretty nice and recently finding out

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.600 
pretty nice and recently finding out
that<00:05:13.100> some<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.880> its<00:05:14.590> minimum<00:05:15.590> damage<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:16.280> close

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
that some of its minimum damage is close

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.120 
that some of its minimum damage is close
to<00:05:16.790> 19<00:05:17.300> which<00:05:17.810> if<00:05:17.990> its<00:05:18.170> minimum<00:05:18.500> damage<00:05:18.560> is

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
to 19 which if its minimum damage is

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.400 
to 19 which if its minimum damage is
around<00:05:19.520> 19<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.360> means<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.810> has<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.050> higher

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
around 19 that means it has a higher

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.370 
around 19 that means it has a higher
minimum<00:05:21.680> damage<00:05:22.270> than<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.690> general<00:05:24.080> assault

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
minimum damage than the general assault

minimum damage than the general assault
