00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
alright so we know this controllers

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.720 
alright so we know this controllers
updated<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.350> everyone's<00:03:32.770> saying<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.190> update

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
updated so everyone's saying that update

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.020 
updated so everyone's saying that update
the<00:03:33.880> controller<00:03:34.270> it'll<00:03:34.510> fix<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.490> there<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:36.790> go

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
the controller it'll fix it there you go

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.330 
the controller it'll fix it there you go
look<00:03:37.450> at<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:38.050> can't<00:03:38.380> make<00:03:38.620> tiny<00:03:39.010> aim

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
look at that you can't make tiny aim

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.580 
look at that you can't make tiny aim
adjustments<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.450> have<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.720> make<00:03:40.870> big<00:03:40.900> aim

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
adjustments you have to make big aim

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.380 
adjustments you have to make big aim
adjustments<00:03:42.430> not<00:03:43.150> tiny<00:03:43.630> ones<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:46.060> I'll<00:03:46.150> cut

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
adjustments not tiny ones so I'll cut

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.480 
adjustments not tiny ones so I'll cut
that<00:03:46.540> off<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.080> we<00:03:47.740> will<00:03:47.920> try<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.190> new

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
that off and we will try the new

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.870 
that off and we will try the new
controller<00:03:50.100> alright<00:03:51.100> guys<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:51.550> we<00:03:51.640> got<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
controller alright guys so we got the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 
controller alright guys so we got the
brand<00:03:52.150> new<00:03:52.270> controller<00:03:52.810> let's<00:03:53.140> look<00:03:53.440> know<00:03:54.070> day

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
brand new controller let's look know day

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.700 
brand new controller let's look know day
one<00:03:54.670> edition<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.270> middle<00:03:55.570> here<00:03:55.900> brand

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
one edition in the middle here brand

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.880 
one edition in the middle here brand
spanking<00:03:57.610> new<00:03:57.640> controller<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:59.500> we'll<00:03:59.710> check

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
spanking new controller and we'll check

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.500 
spanking new controller and we'll check
the<00:04:00.070> dead<00:04:00.250> zones<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.120> will<00:04:01.300> prove

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the dead zones on it and I will prove

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.720 
the dead zones on it and I will prove
that<00:04:01.570> it's<00:04:01.870> not<00:04:01.930> updated<00:04:02.620> after<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:03.160> so

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
that it's not updated after this so

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:13.260 
that it's not updated after this so
let's<00:04:04.510> check<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.960> dead<00:04:05.140> zones<00:04:12.270> definitely

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
let's check the dead zones definitely

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.900 
let's check the dead zones definitely
still<00:04:14.050> dead<00:04:14.350> zones<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.100> brand<00:04:15.760> new

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
still dead zones on a brand new

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.570 
still dead zones on a brand new
controller<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:20.380> can't<00:04:20.680> make<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.280> tiny

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
controller you can't make the tiny

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.910 
controller you can't make the tiny
adjustments<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.510> need<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.960> do<00:04:23.140> in<00:04:23.440> a

adjustments that you need to do in a
shooting<00:04:24.310> game<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.850> this<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> big<00:04:25.570> mistake

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
shooting game and this is a big mistake
