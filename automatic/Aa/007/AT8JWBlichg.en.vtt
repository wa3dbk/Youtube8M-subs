00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 hi all guys are kiwis and here I am 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.130
 here with a new video a second video 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.080
 me really important because we will do a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 little point of the situation on mine 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 channel we will also see a little to understand 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630
 what is happening in the latter 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 days 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 then the background is a mob of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 msr has finally arrived and is made in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.270
 a sniper lobby for those of you who don't 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 he knew practically how to play 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 team deathmatches only ed 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 exclusively with snipers no and yes 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 some of you may think that it is more 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.980
 Simple, some of you may think 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.570
 which is more difficult and sincerely but 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.340
 I honestly don't care 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.399
 nothing if you put thumbs down a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.899
 this mob 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.219
 I only tell you that as you can see is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.630
 almost it is practically all left is 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:10.759
 almost all done in quick purpose therefore 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.779
 in short it is done but you on a pc so then 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.700
 put me an answer video and then 

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:16.349
 I can accept yours I don't like 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 but as I said before I don't care 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:22.950
 however the short video then I say yes 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.149
 I want to talk today then lately 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 you are no longer active 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.529
 what it means for a long time this is mine 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.779
 channel to this problem and I remember 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:32.520
 that had already happened during the summer e 

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:33.689
 I was told kiwi not you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 worry 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.169
 with the arrival of the school with the arrival 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.669
 in short, all your winter 

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:41.789
 writings will come back from vacation and 

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:45.899
 will be active was not so because 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.060
 guys the last video then was of 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.399
 battlefield train my first video of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.999
 battlefield 3 first day 100 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.289
 views and 40 I like and I 1250 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.020
 subscribers 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.029
 here there is something that does not come back and I have 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.539
 tried varied as you know i have 

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:06.179
 tried sniper elite 80 views 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.000
 it was nice if i arrived at 20 i like it 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.500
 proven battlefield 3 is not good if 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.530
 however I charge the fashions 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.770
 just mob we want 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.750
 the variety then guys said their own 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.030
 out of the teeth what the fuck you want to see 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.250
 on my channel because then I think 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.190
 so 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.050
 I'm the one who makes video ok but if the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.940
 my audience doesn't follow me if mine 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 public does not appreciate my videos i i 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.280
 video I don't make them anymore is very simple 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 because obviously it's not you 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.650
 decide which videos will be uploaded to 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 my channel but if one tells me it begins 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 a series on the night pokemon I say no 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.090
 is said to start a series on battlefield 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.620
 all right I'll try to buy the game 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.769
 I will try to have the game and I will try to 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.410
 doing this series is fine because this 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.180
 is my view not many 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.870
 they think i am my channel i do 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.360
 what they want 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.250
 you are my writings and the only thing 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.540
 what interests me is entertaining you and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.630
 make the videos that you upload there 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.730
 like them then then starting from 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.709
 this time there will be two videos a 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.290
 week in such a way that none of 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.760
 you can use the excuse that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.340
 don't know when my videos come out or 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.989
 I don't even know why to throw one 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.690
 look at the home of youtube 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.730
 it doesn't take much and so the first one 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.680
 video will be on Tuesday according to video will be 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.209
 on Friday I will try to respect 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.650
 these days and maybe they won't be videos 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.610
 they will be put at random not necessarily 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.640
 Tuesday one type of game and Friday one 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.620
 another type of game and nothing said 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.590
 this guys I'm waiting for yours 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.510
 advice because I honestly don't know anymore 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.130
 what fish to take 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.859
 more than once I thought of closing 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.980
 the channel more than once I thought of 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.090
 stop making videos not to search 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.010
 in short, being a victim is in short 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.930
 read in the comments no who continues to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.070
 make kiwi videos stay with us and so on 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.170
 me all these things are interested in pro 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.019
 what interests me most is that it is 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.549
 a channel with these members 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.500
 writings must be active because me 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.289
 I have never but never really obliged 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.560
 no one to sign up for my channel either 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.419
 much less I did and I registered 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.650
 then replace all this inactivity 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.410
 where it comes I really hope that 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.050
 you know how to give me an answer the video 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.960
 it's already running out and it's been really short 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.820
 as I said at the beginning please 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.039
 show me that you are there I ask you 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.110

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.919
