we're<00:00:14.700> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:16.100> get<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> good<00:00:17.369> steady<00:00:17.640> base

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
we're going to do get a good steady base

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.640 
we're going to do get a good steady base
or<00:00:18.240> something<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.990> work<00:00:19.380> with

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
or something that you can work with

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.070 
or something that you can work with
because<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> create<00:00:20.550> pressure

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
because you're going to create pressure

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
because you're going to create pressure
you<00:00:22.080> want<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:22.740> battery<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
motor is not turning therefore the motor

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.749 
motor is not turning therefore the motor
is<00:01:26.070> no<00:01:26.310> good<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:28.189> instead<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> tearing<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is no good so instead of tearing this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.719 
is no good so instead of tearing this
apart<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:31.320> send<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
apart I will send it out and have it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
apart I will send it out and have it
rebuilt<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.810> show<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> another<00:01:34.350> test

rebuilt now I will show you another test

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060 
rebuilt now I will show you another test
that<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.579> another<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.860> can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that we do another one and see if we can

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
that we do another one and see if we can
get<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> might<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.780> approve<00:01:40.290> don't

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
right they either ground out the mortar
and<00:02:00.750> properly<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.649> fry<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.219> doesn't

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and properly and they fry it it doesn't

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.929 
and properly and they fry it it doesn't
take<00:02:02.670> long<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> fry<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.450> motors<00:02:04.110> there's

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
take long to fry these motors there's

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
take long to fry these motors there's

one<00:02:20.069> year<00:02:20.310> only<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:22.459> lot<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.610> things<00:02:23.849> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.239> 65

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
one year only a lot of things on the 65

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.210 
one year only a lot of things on the 65
is<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.319> year<00:02:25.560> only

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
is one year only

is one year only
so<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.450> again<00:02:27.599> we<00:02:27.989> got<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> good<00:02:28.590> ground<00:02:29.390> we'll

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
so here again we got a good ground we'll

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.420 
so here again we got a good ground we'll
attach<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.049> we<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.439> tack<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.069> one<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
attach it we can tack it to one of the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
attach it we can tack it to one of the
shiny<00:02:32.730> balls<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.659> that's<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.049> good<00:02:34.230> ground

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
shiny balls up here that's a good ground

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.880 
shiny balls up here that's a good ground
area<00:02:37.400> grab<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.579> plug<00:02:38.790> again<00:02:39.439> this<00:02:40.439> is<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
area grab the plug again this is the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.949 
area grab the plug again this is the
second<00:02:41.310> motor<00:02:42.950> nothing<00:02:44.750> haha<00:02:47.810> started<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
second motor nothing haha started to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.420 
second motor nothing haha started to
work<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.409> let's<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.769> back<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.129> see<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
work now let's go back and see if it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.819 
work now let's go back and see if it
goes<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.730> other<00:02:50.849> way<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.049> works

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
goes the other way there go it's works

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.160 
goes the other way there go it's works
now<00:02:53.579> here's<00:02:53.879> again<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.599> their<00:02:55.049> head

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
now here's again on the on their head

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.710 
now here's again on the on their head
over<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.159> you<00:02:56.220> got<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.760> pin<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.510> is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
over here you go you got one pin that is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.319 
over here you go you got one pin that is
one<00:02:58.680> way<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.099> other<00:02:59.250> pin<00:02:59.489> takes<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.000> together

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
one way the other pin takes it together

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.410 
one way the other pin takes it together
open<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.930> close<00:03:01.189> touch<00:03:02.189> one<00:03:02.430> pin<00:03:04.939> that<00:03:05.939> motors

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
open and close touch one pin that motors

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.330 
open and close touch one pin that motors
working<00:03:06.750> quite<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.439> of<00:03:07.530> torque<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
working quite a bit of torque there a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.330 
working quite a bit of torque there a
lot<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.879> torque<00:03:09.680> put<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.889> neutral

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
lot of torque put it in the neutral

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.140 
lot of torque put it in the neutral
position<00:03:11.370> let's<00:03:12.209> rearrange<00:03:12.689> my<00:03:13.170> ground<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
position let's rearrange my ground so I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.039 
position let's rearrange my ground so I
can<00:03:15.450> check<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.049> see<00:03:17.150> how<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.480> strength<00:03:18.840> this

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
can check and see how much strength this

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.309 
can check and see how much strength this
motor<00:03:19.379> is<00:03:19.620> got<00:03:21.530> make<00:03:22.530> sure<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> got<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.069> good

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
motor is got make sure I got a good

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:36.199 
motor is got make sure I got a good
ground<00:03:25.609> good<00:03:26.609> ground<00:03:27.709> now<00:03:32.629> pin<00:03:34.519> okay<00:03:35.549> now<00:03:35.790> Todd

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
ground good ground now pin okay now Todd

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.530 
ground good ground now pin okay now Todd
will<00:03:36.449> hold<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:38.430> I'm<00:03:38.760> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.000> try<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.299> hold

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
will hold that I'm going to try to hold

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.319 
will hold that I'm going to try to hold
this<00:03:39.750> motor<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.579> touch<00:03:41.579> someone<00:03:41.849> pin<00:03:44.329> so

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
this motor and touch someone pin so

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.580 
this motor and touch someone pin so
you're<00:03:45.449> kind<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.629> working<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> little<00:03:46.229> bit<00:03:46.409> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
you're kind of working it a little bit I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.369 
you're kind of working it a little bit I
can<00:03:46.739> stop<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> motor<00:03:47.659> so<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:48.690> motor<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.169> no

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
can stop the motor so the motor is no

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.149 
can stop the motor so the motor is no
good<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.010> very<00:03:50.400> weak<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:52.590> that's<00:03:52.799> another

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
good it's very weak so that's another

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.339 
good it's very weak so that's another
bad<00:03:53.430> sign<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.269> means<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.840> to

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
bad sign so that means you have to

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.969 
bad sign so that means you have to
replace<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.040> motor<00:03:59.599> and<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.709> give<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
replace the motor and just to give the

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.979 
replace the motor and just to give the
viewers<00:04:02.729> an<00:04:02.879> idea<00:04:03.180> what<00:04:03.449> does<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.659> cost<00:04:03.810> to

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
viewers an idea what does it cost to

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.930 
viewers an idea what does it cost to
either<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.409> one<00:04:04.440> rebuilt<00:04:05.010> or<00:04:05.269> or<00:04:06.620> fixed<00:04:07.940> well

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
either have one rebuilt or or fixed well

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.990 
either have one rebuilt or or fixed well
it<00:04:09.150> really<00:04:09.389> depends<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.379> use<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.760> best

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
it really depends I use one of the best

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.210 
it really depends I use one of the best
people<00:04:12.269> around<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:14.299> I'd<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.949> they<00:04:16.949> do<00:04:17.010> a

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
people around and I'd like to they do a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.839 
people around and I'd like to they do a
real<00:04:17.519> good<00:04:17.549> job<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.599> field<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.320> armature

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
real good job the field and the armature

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.760 
real good job the field and the armature
brushes<00:04:20.849> everything<00:04:21.269> else<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.750> lot<00:04:22.409> of<00:04:22.529> places

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
brushes everything else a lot of places

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.720 
brushes everything else a lot of places
just<00:04:23.010> change<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.729> brushes

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
just change the brushes

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.790 
just change the brushes
or<00:04:24.790> they'll<00:04:25.150> rotate<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.870> gear<00:04:26.200> head<00:04:26.470> and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
or they'll rotate the gear head and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.400 
or they'll rotate the gear head and
consider<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.910> rebuilt<00:04:28.420> that's<00:04:28.840> not<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.290> way
