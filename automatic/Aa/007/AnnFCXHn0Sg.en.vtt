 may the rival always let you 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 you have to place the ball well with 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.519
 the handles down then it incorporates you 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.289

 security what we can say is that

 Of course the same ball already covers you 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.100
 body and we have incorporated 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 also a knee brace for protecting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.220
 knees and be able to get up with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.920
 security if it harms them as we have 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.929
 three sizes we can play from children 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 even people who play basketball 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.810
 professional is a sport that as 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.149
 You can see frantic crashes each 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.340
 with the others bounces the wheels and good 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.049
 the case is having a great time 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.840
 it seemed very funny a very idea 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.700
 original different and good we are 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.549
 It's going very well I throw myself on the floor 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 all the time but good if we give ourselves 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.470
 blows we fall we put goals and it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 can and quite well we take good 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 protected with knee pads 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.590
 the balls since they dampen enough 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.020
 the blow and well tired tires tired 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.370
 rather more than if a ball 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.760
 obviously but good very good 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.190
 true that very funny experience 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.930
 tired tired but you have a great time 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.460
 There comes a time when you are 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.990
 looking for the ball but as soon as you see 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.450
 a person you forgot the ball 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 directly and you go for it to sack and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.010
 to play sports you can also be 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.260
 very well because the truth is that it tires and 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.870
 does it's pretty sport the idea for 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.759
 to win in the shock is that if you see 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.370
 that someone comes to you do not stay still 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.170
 go to the still positive all 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.880
 the forces back then you have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.890
 that trying to throw had it fall or the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.440
 two was the idea the truth that is very 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 fun yes because being small then 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.330
 like they throw you before and I do not know no 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 they enjoy more because again you are 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 running because I at least I get tired 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.200
 a little more than the balls I thought 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.600
 that weighed more and I did not walk before and 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.600
 the one that throw people I laugh a lot 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.420
 Well, we have several games about everything 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.830
 those who have the best time 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.310
 participants is to one who is called 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.800
 protect the leader that deals with there is a 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.720
 leader in the team the team that goes 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.820
 together protects the leader and the leader can 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.340
 get in the goal with your hands 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.830
 throw it by the ball the goal or 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.930
 kick it too if the leader falls to 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.370
 ground the opposing team wins and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.110
 exchanged and again it is again the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.700
 leader the opposing team and another game 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.950
 also very fun that is of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.200
 Fame innovation is everyone's against 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.820
 it does not matter to the team that you go 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.500
 to which the color of the important bib is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.910
 that only one winner remains and the winner 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 is the one that remains standing others there 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.030
 they would fall, they would be eliminated and 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.190
 off the track we have been 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.350
 playing this google soccer that is 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.850
 awesome it's really fun 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.580
 loose a lot of adrenaline on everything 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.290
 when you're falling to the ground you're 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.730
 circling like everyone else this 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.650
 is trying to throw you try 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.300
 get up can not be very very 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.350
 fun and if you add soccer 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.600
 jazz 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.110
 At the best, the truth is very good. 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.110
 I recommend
