00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.450 
Duffy one of the things I like about
your<00:00:39.989> design<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.770> always<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.370> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
your design they don't always have to be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
your design they don't always have to be
straight<00:00:41.760> lines<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.420> effective<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
straight lines to be effective and the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
straight lines to be effective and the
depths<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.399> lines<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.390> deliberate

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
depths of your lines are very deliberate

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
depths of your lines are very deliberate
and<00:00:46.320> symmetrical<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.730> gives<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and symmetrical so it really gives this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
and symmetrical so it really gives this
thing<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.480> standout<00:00:48.960> look<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> distance

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
thing a standout look from a distance

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.720 
thing a standout look from a distance

the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> use<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.539> tools<00:00:54.750> for

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the way that you use the tools for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
the way that you use the tools for
different<00:00:55.230> effects<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> overall<00:00:56.699> the

line<00:01:00.510> weights<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.379> strong<00:01:01.559> piece

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
line weights it's a really strong piece

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
line weights it's a really strong piece
thank<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.309> much

Kito the amount of depth you were able

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
Kito the amount of depth you were able
to<00:01:06.509> cut<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.899> this<00:01:07.079> thing<00:01:07.289> and<00:01:07.469> keep<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.950> as

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to cut out of this thing and keep it as

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
to cut out of this thing and keep it as
clean<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> crisp<00:01:09.329> as<00:01:09.539> it<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.079> very<00:01:10.170> sharp

clean and crisp as it is it's very sharp

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
clean and crisp as it is it's very sharp
gives<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.789> dynamic<00:01:12.479> shadowing<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
gives it a lot of dynamic shadowing and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.959 
gives it a lot of dynamic shadowing and
it<00:01:13.469> just<00:01:13.679> makes<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.039> very<00:01:14.189> legible<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.789> a
