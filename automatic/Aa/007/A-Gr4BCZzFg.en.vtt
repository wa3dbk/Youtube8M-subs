00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello people welcome again to put together 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:10.360
 the new channel design continued with the 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.970
 series of tutorials on this occasion then 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.770
 is a very short tutorial about 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.039
 basically how to fix errors 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.650
 of the hard disk these errors can 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.350
 cause your laptop or pc to get 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.880
 slow and for that we're going to use a 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.840
 of the tools that windows us 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.910
 offers while my team and you go to 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.590
 hard disk you press right button and 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.620
 you choose properties 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.340
 here for example we realize the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 slowness of this machine due to the fact 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.320
 I give a click and it takes a while to open 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.030
 the program that does have some 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.500
 errors in hard disk and therefore with this 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.370
 we will solve it 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.200
 she opened but basically because 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.930
 you have to go to this tab that is 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.180
 tools 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.680
 and use the file verifier of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.199
 hard drive and select the two 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.180
 tabs and you give it to start once 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.360
 done this so you put it to check 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.440
 the hard disk when you start the machine 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.420
 this 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.220
 this option many times appears 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.920
 when the machine starts and many people 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.400
 it jumps the truth is that sometimes there 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.320
 to leave it because it solves problems 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 of corrupt files damaged files 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 Hard disk sectors 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.980
 in most cases it solves 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.690
 the slowness of some machines here 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.440
 Well, let's hope it restarts that 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.200
 read a little the camera took a minute in 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.420
 turn off but good already starting this 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.040
 then the error tester starts 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 and then you have to let it finish 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 let it charge let it work 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310
 take five minutes may take 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.159
 fifteen minutes can even reach you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 back up to an hour or more but once 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.600
 that ends then your machine will be 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 faster more stable and then you're going to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 be more happy with the result 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.150
 and already after the end of the machine 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.690
 if it feels much more stable and much 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.980
 better and for my part because that's all 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.560
 Here are some videos in case 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.530
 like to see some of my work in 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.959
 youtube and well then I hope that it 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.019
 subscribe me of the aic and we see the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.019
 next 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.900
 to me
