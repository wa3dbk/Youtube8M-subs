00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.729 
skittish around people but mix right in
with<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> other<00:02:13.209> chickens<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.750> hopefully

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
with the other chickens and hopefully

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.780 
with the other chickens and hopefully
they'll<00:02:14.889> take<00:02:15.040> after<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.400> Reds<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:15.700> lay

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
they'll take after the Reds and lay

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.699 
they'll take after the Reds and lay
their<00:02:15.970> eggs<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.299> coop<00:02:16.510> tests<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.560> don't

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
their eggs in the coop tests so we don't

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.840 
their eggs in the coop tests so we don't
have<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.920> search<00:02:18.100> all<00:02:18.250> over<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.549> yard<00:02:18.639> for

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
have to search all over the yard for

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.599 
have to search all over the yard for
their<00:02:18.940> eggs<00:02:19.120> which<00:02:19.980> unlike<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.040> normal<00:02:21.250> Brown

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
their eggs which unlike the normal Brown

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.000 
their eggs which unlike the normal Brown
shells<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.540> Rhode<00:02:22.989> Island<00:02:23.290> Reds<00:02:23.500> their

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
shells of the Rhode Island Reds their

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.330 
shells of the Rhode Island Reds their
eggshells<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.489> green<00:02:24.639> or<00:02:24.760> blue<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.100> far

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
eggshells are green or blue and so far

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.309 
eggshells are green or blue and so far
in<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.489> first<00:02:27.639> night<00:02:27.940> they're<00:02:28.930> roosting<00:02:29.109> in

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
in the first night they're roosting in

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.599 
in the first night they're roosting in
the<00:02:29.440> coop<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:29.709> along<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> Reds<00:02:30.310> while

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
the coop right along with the Reds while

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.949 
the coop right along with the Reds while
the<00:02:30.700> black<00:02:30.910> rocks<00:02:31.180> still<00:02:31.450> prefer<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> high

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the black rocks still prefer the high

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.590 
the black rocks still prefer the high
tree<00:02:32.200> branch<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.819> we're<00:02:33.970> making<00:02:34.090> some<00:02:34.269> smart

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
tree branch so we're making some smart

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.579 
tree branch so we're making some smart
decisions<00:02:35.109> and<00:02:35.290> we're<00:02:36.130> encouraged
