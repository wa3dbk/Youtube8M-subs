light up to now what you see is the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.139 
light up to now what you see is the
brightness<00:00:59.309> turned<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.359> usually

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
brightness turned up all the way usually

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
brightness turned up all the way usually
I'll<00:01:03.149> show<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> where<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.409> I'm

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I'll show you where I have it when I'm

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820 
I'll show you where I have it when I'm
using<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.810> usually<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.350> above<00:01:07.650> all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
using it I usually have it one above all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.640 
using it I usually have it one above all
the<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:08.100> dim<00:01:08.630> because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.990> rings<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the way dim because the rings around the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
the way dim because the rings around the
gauges<00:01:11.420> show<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:14.460> cuz<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
gauges show up see cuz if you have it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
gauges show up see cuz if you have it
all<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.810> low<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:17.460> doesn't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
all the way low they don't it doesn't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
all the way low they don't it doesn't
light<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> outlying<00:01:19.619> all

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
light up I like to see the outlying all

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.749 
light up I like to see the outlying all
of<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:24.680> like<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> rear<00:01:26.430> lights

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of it I like the look of the rear lights

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.800 
of it I like the look of the rear lights
on<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.590> 2010<00:01:28.590> through<00:01:29.040> 13<00:01:29.610> better<00:01:29.939> than<00:01:31.100> 2014<00:01:32.810> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
on a 2010 through 13 better than 2014 it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.140 
on a 2010 through 13 better than 2014 it
has<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> meaner<00:01:34.290> look

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.440 

now<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.740> rear<00:01:39.190> side<00:01:39.790> marker<00:01:40.240> light

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
now you do have a rear side marker light

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.720 
now you do have a rear side marker light
and<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.750> front<00:01:41.080> side<00:01:41.680> marker<00:01:42.100> turn<00:01:42.280> signal

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
and a front side marker turn signal

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.320 
and a front side marker turn signal
light<00:01:42.910> -<00:01:46.830> since<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:47.980> is<00:01:48.190> just<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.760> base<00:01:49.030> model

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
light - since this is just a base model

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.560 
light - since this is just a base model
it<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.810> has<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> regular<00:01:50.760> halogen<00:01:51.760> lights<00:01:52.090> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.770 

do<00:01:55.570> want<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.990> eventually<00:01:56.410> add<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.710> fog<00:01:57.010> lights

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
do want to eventually add the fog lights

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.240 
do want to eventually add the fog lights
probably<00:01:58.780> next<00:01:59.140> year<00:01:59.410> I'll<00:01:59.740> probably<00:01:59.770> put<00:02:00.220> a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
probably next year I'll probably put a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.280 
probably next year I'll probably put a
video<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:03.150> now<00:02:04.150> this<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.330> my<00:02:04.600> other<00:02:04.900> car

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
video of that now this is my other car

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.510 
video of that now this is my other car
an<00:02:05.590> old<00:02:06.040> one<00:02:06.310> Pontiac<00:02:06.820> Bonneville<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.340> want

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
to put these footwell lights like in

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.100 
to put these footwell lights like in
this<00:02:13.630> car<00:02:13.930> probably<00:02:14.320> in<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> Camaro<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
this car probably in the Camaro and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.250 
this car probably in the Camaro and
they're<00:02:17.740> wired<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.190> with<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.510> dash<00:02:19.720> panel

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
they're wired in with the dash panel

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.280 
they're wired in with the dash panel
lights<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:21.790> brighten<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.540> dim<00:02:23.050> them

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
lights so you can brighten and dim them

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.790 
lights so you can brighten and dim them
along<00:02:23.590> with<00:02:23.860> your<00:02:24.310> dash<00:02:25.000> panel<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.720> really<00:02:26.650> do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
along with your dash panel I really do

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.460 
along with your dash panel I really do
like<00:02:26.980> how<00:02:27.190> they<00:02:27.370> turned<00:02:27.610> out<00:02:28.140> when<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> first

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
like how they turned out when I first

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.310 
like how they turned out when I first
started<00:02:29.800> driving<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.310> Camaro<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:31.810> night<00:02:32.110> it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
started driving the Camaro at night it's

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.140 
started driving the Camaro at night it's
like<00:02:32.470> something's<00:02:32.890> missing<00:02:33.130> without<00:02:33.850> having

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
like something's missing without having

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
like something's missing without having
these<00:02:34.240> lights<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.620> since<00:02:36.190> there's<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.460> little

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
these lights and since there's a little

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
these lights and since there's a little
bit<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.910> red<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.480> dash<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.960> that<00:02:38.110> car<00:02:38.350> I'm

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bit of red on the dash in that car I'm

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.560 
bit of red on the dash in that car I'm
probably<00:02:38.590> gonna<00:02:38.800> go<00:02:38.950> with<00:02:38.980> red<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.330> go<00:02:40.510> to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
probably gonna go with red if they go to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.800 
probably gonna go with red if they go to
