00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
on the August 2012 video but as you can

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.770 
on the August 2012 video but as you can
see<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.080> gets<00:04:24.230> really<00:04:24.470> tough<00:04:25.070> later<00:04:25.970> on<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.480> I

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
see it gets really tough later on and I

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.020 
see it gets really tough later on and I
did<00:04:27.110> not<00:04:27.350> die<00:04:27.620> since<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:28.010> had<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.400> extra<00:04:28.820> power

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
did not die since I had that extra power

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.660 
did not die since I had that extra power
up<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:29.450> if<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.690> die<00:04:29.930> right<00:04:29.960> if<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.070> got<00:04:31.250> hit<00:04:31.490> right

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
up but if I die right if I got hit right

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.420 
up but if I die right if I got hit right
now<00:04:31.730> I'd<00:04:32.060> die<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:33.230> definitely<00:04:33.800> really<00:04:34.190> fun

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430
