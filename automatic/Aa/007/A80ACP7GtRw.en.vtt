00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
these knifes which is good if you want

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.349 
these knifes which is good if you want
to<00:04:17.979> cut<00:04:18.160> through<00:04:18.310> some<00:04:18.430> small<00:04:18.609> branches<00:04:19.180> or

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
to cut through some small branches or

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.860 
to cut through some small branches or
things<00:04:19.859> carve<00:04:20.859> up<00:04:20.979> some<00:04:21.160> wood<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.720> again<00:04:22.720> this

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
things carve up some wood and again this

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.560 
things carve up some wood and again this
one<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.139> is<00:04:23.700> well<00:04:24.700> it's<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.880> little<00:04:25.090> looser<00:04:25.389> but

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
one is is well it's a little looser but

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.550 
one is is well it's a little looser but
it's<00:04:25.750> not<00:04:26.340> it's<00:04:27.340> not<00:04:27.460> spring-assisted<00:04:28.560> okay

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
it's not it's not spring-assisted okay

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.750 
it's not it's not spring-assisted okay
so<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.770> have<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.979> give<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> little<00:04:30.400> bit<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.669> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
so you have to give it a little bit of a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.520 
so you have to give it a little bit of a
momentum<00:04:31.510> if<00:04:31.690> you're<00:04:31.900> going<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.080> open<00:04:32.289> it<00:04:32.440> up

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
momentum if you're going to open it up

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.350 
momentum if you're going to open it up
can't<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.520> do<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.760> on<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:33.969> short<00:04:34.210> little

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
can't really do it on this short little
