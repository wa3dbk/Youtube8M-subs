00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.960
 new colors with a completely new one 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 corporate identity website and clothing 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 marianne vos women's team a complete 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:20.189
 new look the logo of strong together 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 achieved on clothing and cars and is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.010
 just one of the team's spearheads 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 sugar from the bank together is also the only one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.250
 time to demolish the window because of it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.329
 symbolizes what the windows was afraid of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 and the teams actually thought so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
 snowfall the women's team feels there 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 also very strongly addressed because they 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.250
 also realize your performance 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 so never lived alone with each other 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 actually it was very nice to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 combine it and therefore also as a slogan 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 use the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 bank , they also came up with this idea 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 I stand well together well that is too 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 something we like teams that wore 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120
 We are already out and we will continue to do so 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 yes you can get enough samples and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.520
 families of course with merchant throughout 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.530
 bad negative words can really only 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 just as a team 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 the team explain what a beautiful 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.540
 project is yes that are things involving you 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 can tell this story very well 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.880
 carry out 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 and not just the riders among the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 but also the person behind that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.670
 rensen stands where the caregiver thereby 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.409
 unique and the team leader the doctors 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 trainer everything that comes with it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.240
 to make a team like this successful 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 are some fly and and of clothing 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 well i think it is beautiful it is and that is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.579
 very innovative and yes that is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 nice that you just the old 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.799
 the past then 8 hours later than again 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.659
 something with something fresh 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.939
 I really like beautiful clothes then you have the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.290
 the slogan and together what stronger 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.280
 means that for the team and for the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.689
 Bank 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.159
 well i think that's the parallel 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.149
 whole between the bench in the team 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.950
 has strong 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.930
 stronger together it is natural gaiwan 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 cook cooperative banking 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.560
 well with one with the cycling team 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 nothing more important than yesterday 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.040
 collaborate 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 the stronger together is the best slogan 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.440
 that you can have for that I think it is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 well 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.390
 yes it takes some getting used to and the star 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.800
 totally different and i think it is 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.750
 Not just because it must radiate 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.650
 beautiful is of course it stands for something 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.900
 and I think we like the steam 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.980
 10200 worn out actually 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 strong together
