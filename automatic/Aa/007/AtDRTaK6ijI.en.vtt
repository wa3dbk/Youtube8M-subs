this pot I've melted down some sugar and
some<00:00:30.900> water<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.859> create<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.759> nice

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
some water to create a really nice

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180 
some water to create a really nice
caramel<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> key<00:00:34.530> thing<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:35.130> you're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
caramel now the key thing when you're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.490 
caramel now the key thing when you're
making<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.820> caramel<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.079> stir<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
making this caramel is not to stir it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
making this caramel is not to stir it
because<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> stir<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.640> sugar<00:00:38.940> will

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
because if you stir it as sugar will

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
because if you stir it as sugar will
become<00:00:39.329> crystallized<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> won't<00:00:40.469> get

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
become crystallized and you won't get

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
become crystallized and you won't get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.940 
this cake we are going to need a salted
caramel<00:01:27.000> sauce<00:01:27.080> now<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
caramel sauce now what I have here is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.679 
caramel sauce now what I have here is
similar<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.729> we've<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:29.909> done<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
similar to what we've just done and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
similar to what we've just done and
that's<00:01:30.990> creating<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> caramel<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.759> sugar<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that's creating a caramel from sugar and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
that's creating a caramel from sugar and
water<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> high

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
water so I'm gonna get that on a high

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
water so I'm gonna get that on a high
heat<00:01:37.820> now<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> point<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.720> caramel<00:01:40.380> has

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
heat now at this point my caramel has

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
heat now at this point my caramel has
become<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.340> rich<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.759> golden<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
become really rich in golden and just

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
become really rich in golden and just
make<00:01:43.049> sure<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.700> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
make sure that you don't go too much on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.060 
make sure that you don't go too much on
your<00:01:45.450> gold<00:01:45.750> color<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.380> otherwise<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.829> can

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
your gold color because otherwise it can

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
your gold color because otherwise it can
actually<00:01:47.220> burn<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> bitter<00:01:48.450> taste

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
actually burn and you get a bitter taste

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
actually burn and you get a bitter taste
in<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.020> caramel<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.009> pretty<00:01:50.159> good

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
in your caramel but this is pretty good

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
in your caramel but this is pretty good
so<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.610> gonna<00:01:50.729> knock<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> heat<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> at

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so I'm gonna knock off the heat and at

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
so I'm gonna knock off the heat and at
this<00:01:52.740> point<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.399> stir<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.899> cream

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
this point I'm gonna stir in some cream

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.530 
this point I'm gonna stir in some cream
now<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.490> important<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> stand<00:01:57.240> back

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
now it really is important to stand back

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.749 
now it really is important to stand back

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because this will spit and bowl so

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.679 
because this will spit and bowl so
straight<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.799> mix<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:03.210> give<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> good

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the heat and allow it to cool so now we

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.150 
the heat and allow it to cool so now we
need<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.510> talk<00:02:52.750> about<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.290> cake<00:02:53.530> batter<00:02:53.769> it's

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
need to talk about this cake batter it's

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.770 
need to talk about this cake batter it's
a<00:02:54.250> little<00:02:54.519> unusual<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.300> fact<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.600> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
a little unusual in the fact that it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.350 
a little unusual in the fact that it
doesn't<00:02:56.110> use<00:02:56.140> flour<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.040> uses<00:02:57.400> almonds<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.269> it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
doesn't use flour it uses almonds so it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.110 
doesn't use flour it uses almonds so it
becomes<00:02:58.660> quite<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.019> dense<00:02:59.500> chocolatey<00:03:00.220> cake<00:03:00.430> so

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
becomes quite a dense chocolatey cake so

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.940 
becomes quite a dense chocolatey cake so
to<00:03:01.180> start<00:03:01.480> off<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.170> some<00:03:02.530> melted

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
to start off I have some melted

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.040 
to start off I have some melted
chocolate<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.459> butter<00:03:03.820> over<00:03:04.239> here<00:03:04.720> which

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
chocolate and butter over here which

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.900 
chocolate and butter over here which
I've<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.410> simmered<00:03:05.769> in<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.280> little<00:03:06.519> pan<00:03:06.730> of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
I've just simmered in a little pan of

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.300 
I've just simmered in a little pan of
water<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.840> has<00:03:07.989> become<00:03:08.140> really<00:03:08.560> silky

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
water and this has become really silky

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.670 
water and this has become really silky
and<00:03:09.430> glossy<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.060> exactly<00:03:10.959> how<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.140> need<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and glossy and exactly how I need to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.759 
and glossy and exactly how I need to
start<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.130> pie<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.090> grab<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> big<00:03:13.989> bowl<00:03:14.200> spoon

start this pie so grab a big bowl spoon
this<00:03:15.010> out<00:03:15.220> now<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.090> case<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.329> folding

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
this out now it's just a case of folding

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.600 
this out now it's just a case of folding
through<00:03:17.290> our<00:03:17.470> dry<00:03:17.680> ingredients<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.280> our<00:03:18.430> egg

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
through our dry ingredients and our egg

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.250 
through our dry ingredients and our egg
yolks<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.600> ground<00:03:20.110> almonds<00:03:20.530> go<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.799> here

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
yolks so ground almonds go in here

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.810 
yolks so ground almonds go in here
our<00:03:23.260> caster<00:03:23.769> sugar<00:03:23.799> goes<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:24.579> as<00:03:24.670> well

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
our caster sugar goes in here as well

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.710 
our caster sugar goes in here as well
and<00:03:25.980> then<00:03:26.980> those<00:03:27.220> egg<00:03:27.459> yolks<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:30.030> now<00:03:31.030> all<00:03:31.360> it

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
and then those egg yolks and now all it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then those egg yolks and now all it
is<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:32.079> case<00:03:32.380> folded<00:03:33.160> these<00:03:33.310> through<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.880> it

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
is is a case folded these through and it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.090 
is is a case folded these through and it
changes<00:03:34.510> consistency<00:03:35.170> into<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.709> really

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
changes consistency into this really

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.240 
changes consistency into this really
thick<00:03:36.579> chocolaty<00:03:37.269> batter<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.590> now<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:38.980> time

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
thick chocolaty batter so now it's time

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.310

nice fluffy white peaks so into a
standing<00:03:44.980> mixer<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:46.320> we'll<00:03:47.320> just

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
standing mixer like this and we'll just

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
now I'm just gonna fold these big

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.540 
now I'm just gonna fold these big
voluminous<00:04:05.840> quite<00:04:06.500> Peaks<00:04:06.830> through<00:04:07.310> our

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
voluminous quite Peaks through our

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.720 
voluminous quite Peaks through our
chocolate<00:04:08.090> mixture<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:09.110> just<00:04:09.290> scoop<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.430> a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
chocolate mixture so just scoop it out a

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.170 
chocolate mixture so just scoop it out a
little<00:04:11.660> bit<00:04:11.870> first<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.610> we'll<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:13.760> cut<00:04:14.000> that

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
little bit first and we'll just cut that

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.850 
little bit first and we'll just cut that
through<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.720> then<00:04:15.050> cut<00:04:15.320> through<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.680> whole

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860

through and then cut through the whole
rest<00:04:16.160> of<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.239> method<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:17.780> great

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
rest of it and this method is great

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.420 
rest of it and this method is great
because<00:04:18.350> it's<00:04:18.590> actually<00:04:18.769> gluten<00:04:19.220> free

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
because it's actually gluten free

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.220 
because it's actually gluten free
because<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.880> don't<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.450> any<00:04:20.600> flour<00:04:20.959> in

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
because you don't have any flour in

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.170 
because you don't have any flour in
there<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.590> instead<00:04:21.920> your<00:04:22.430> ground<00:04:22.700> almonds

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
there and instead your ground almonds

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.740 
there and instead your ground almonds
form<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.660> basis<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.560> consistency<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
form the basis of the consistency so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.870 
form the basis of the consistency so
just<00:04:26.990> fold<00:04:27.590> through<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.919> rest<00:04:28.100> now<00:04:28.310> very<00:04:28.610> very

just fold through the rest now very very
gently<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.419> ensure<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:30.050> keep<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.710> lot<00:04:30.919> of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
gently to ensure that we keep a lot of

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.650 
gently to ensure that we keep a lot of
the<00:04:31.130> air<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.640> we've<00:04:31.790> folded<00:04:32.060> through<00:04:32.450> there

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
the air that we've folded through there

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.200 
the air that we've folded through there
and<00:04:33.310> instantly<00:04:34.310> when<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.460> add<00:04:34.669> them<00:04:34.880> in<00:04:35.030> there
