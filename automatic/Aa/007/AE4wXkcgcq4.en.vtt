someone out there that has wanted to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
someone out there that has wanted to
play<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.259> real-life<00:01:46.799> sniper<00:01:47.430> trying<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
play like a real-life sniper trying to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
play like a real-life sniper trying to
take<00:01:48.030> people<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.350> mile<00:01:49.649> away<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.159> mean

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
take people out from a mile away I mean

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
take people out from a mile away I mean
that's<00:01:50.399> always<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's always going to be in there and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
that's always going to be in there and
so<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.979> appears<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.549> dice<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> doing<00:01:54.210> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so what appears that dice is doing is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810 
so what appears that dice is doing is
kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.140> catering<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.009> catering<00:01:56.460> but

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
kind of catering not really catering but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
kind of catering not really catering but
making<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.869> want<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.469> play

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
making it so that if you want to play

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219 
making it so that if you want to play
that<00:01:59.009> type<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> gameplay<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.049> but

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that type of gameplay you can do so but

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.690 
that type of gameplay you can do so but
they're<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:01.500> giving<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.979> incentive<00:02:02.490> to

they're also giving you incentive to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.749 
they're also giving you incentive to
play<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.180> an<00:02:03.630> aggressive<00:02:04.140> recon<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.520> while

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
play as an aggressive recon and so while

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.670 
play as an aggressive recon and so while
yeah<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.930> concerns<00:02:07.409> are

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
dice will put in destroyable roofs and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.090 
dice will put in destroyable roofs and
floors<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.480> about<00:02:45.870> before<00:02:46.320> because<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.980> will

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
floors in about before because it will

game<00:02:50.190> no<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.330> don't<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.080> been

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
game no I don't think it's been

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400 
game no I don't think it's been
confirmed<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:53.000> roofs<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.390> floors<00:02:54.810> will<00:02:55.290> be

confirmed that roofs and floors will be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.610 
confirmed that roofs and floors will be
destructible<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.940> don't<00:02:57.300> see<00:02:57.630> why<00:02:57.930> they

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
destructible but I don't see why they

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.230 
destructible but I don't see why they
wouldn't<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.100> especially<00:02:59.340> for<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
wouldn't do that especially for the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.420 
wouldn't do that especially for the
roofs<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.690> mean<00:03:01.140> I'm<00:03:01.320> kind<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.890> hesitant<00:03:02.220> at

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
roofs I I mean I'm kind of hesitant at

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.340 
roofs I I mean I'm kind of hesitant at
least<00:03:02.640> four<00:03:02.880> floors<00:03:03.209> because<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.260> were

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
least four floors because if you were

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.960 
least four floors because if you were
able<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> take<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.220> floor<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.820> building

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
able to take out the floor of a building

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.000 
able to take out the floor of a building
and<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.660> all<00:03:06.870> every<00:03:07.440> single<00:03:07.470> part<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and just like all every single part of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.890 
and just like all every single part of
it<00:03:08.100> was<00:03:08.190> destroyed<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.720> would<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it was destroyed then that would be a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.420 
it was destroyed then that would be a
little<00:03:10.080> silly<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.530> then<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.130> part<00:03:11.370> of

little silly like then that that part of
the<00:03:11.520> map<00:03:11.640> would<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.880> completely<00:03:12.209> ruined<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the map would be completely ruined and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.020 
the map would be completely ruined and
dice<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.380> said<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.770> they<00:03:14.070> still<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
dice is said that they still want the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.580 
dice is said that they still want the
maps<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.870> structure<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.230> them<00:03:16.440> they

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
maps to have some structure to them they

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
maps to have some structure to them they
don't<00:03:16.680> want<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.100> take<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:17.489> every<00:03:17.940> single

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
don't want you to take down every single

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.910 
don't want you to take down every single
skyscraper<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:19.350> then<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> would<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.769> be

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
skyscraper because then it would just be

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.380 
skyscraper because then it would just be
a<00:03:19.950> rubble<00:03:20.280> mess<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:21.030> would<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.360> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
a rubble mess and it would just be a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.330 
a rubble mess and it would just be a
little<00:03:21.540> ridiculous<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.190> would<00:03:23.280> be

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
little ridiculous and so that would be

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.650 
little ridiculous and so that would be
kind<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> same<00:03:23.850> if<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.180> could<00:03:24.330> just<00:03:24.360> if

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
kind of the same if you could just if

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.660 
kind of the same if you could just if
the<00:03:25.200> map<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.620> centered<00:03:25.980> around<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.459> large

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
the map was centered around a large

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
the map was centered around a large
building<00:03:27.120> or<00:03:27.300> multiple<00:03:27.840> buildings<00:03:27.989> with

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
building or multiple buildings with

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.020 
building or multiple buildings with
different<00:03:28.680> floors<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.489> could<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.700> punch

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
different floors if you could just punch

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940 
different floors if you could just punch
through<00:03:30.300> every<00:03:30.630> single<00:03:30.989> floor<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.739> map

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
through every single floor the map

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.560 
through every single floor the map
itself<00:03:32.130> would<00:03:32.519> dissolve<00:03:32.760> into<00:03:33.120> something

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
itself would dissolve into something

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.540 
itself would dissolve into something
probably<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:34.019> very<00:03:34.050> desirable<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:35.400> you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
probably not very desirable but if you

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.729 
probably not very desirable but if you
could<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.850> for<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> roof<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.780> would<00:03:37.500> be<00:03:37.620> all

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
could do it for the roof I would be all

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.070 
could do it for the roof I would be all
for<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.220> don't<00:03:38.370> see<00:03:38.550> why<00:03:38.790> dice<00:03:39.510> couldn't

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
for that I don't see why dice couldn't

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.470 
for that I don't see why dice couldn't
do<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.260> or<00:03:40.560> why<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:40.890> can't<00:03:41.430> see<00:03:41.610> why<00:03:41.820> they

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
do that or why I can't see why they

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.759 
do that or why I can't see why they
wouldn't<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:42.930> because<00:03:43.200> you're<00:03:43.410> right<00:03:43.590> it

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
wouldn't do that because you're right it

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.070 
wouldn't do that because you're right it
would<00:03:43.950> kind<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.850> some<00:03:45.209> nice<00:03:45.420> tactical

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
would kind of have some nice tactical

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.110 
would kind of have some nice tactical
aspects<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.860> if<00:03:46.980> there's<00:03:47.160> an<00:03:47.280> M<00:03:47.430> come<00:03:47.700> on

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
aspects of it if there's an M come on

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.650 
aspects of it if there's an M come on
the<00:03:48.810> top<00:03:49.260> floor<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.000> chopper<00:03:51.360> you

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
the top floor and you have a chopper you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
the top floor and you have a chopper you
know<00:03:51.780> drop<00:03:52.170> down<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.680> place<00:03:53.130> efore<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> top

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
know drop down in place efore on the top

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.449 
know drop down in place efore on the top
of<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.450> roof<00:03:54.630> then<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> nice

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
of the roof then you now have a nice

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.120 
of the roof then you now have a nice
little<00:03:56.670> hole<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.239> access<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.930> income<00:03:58.290> another

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
little hole to access the income another

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.520 
little hole to access the income another
really<00:03:59.340> cool<00:03:59.580> idea<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.150> had<00:04:00.209> was<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.260> if

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
really cool idea that I had was that if

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.009 
really cool idea that I had was that if
they<00:04:01.830> did<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.519> sections<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.480> floor<00:04:03.780> that

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
they did have sections of the floor that

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.960 
they did have sections of the floor that
were<00:04:04.350> maybe<00:04:04.530> crumbling<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.790> was

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
were maybe crumbling and that was

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.280 
were maybe crumbling and that was
basically<00:04:06.120> kind<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> indicator<00:04:07.200> that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
basically kind of the indicator that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.830 
basically kind of the indicator that
this<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.860> be<00:04:08.040> destroyed<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:09.269> could<00:04:09.450> open<00:04:09.630> up

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
this can be destroyed this could open up

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.630 
this can be destroyed this could open up
different<00:04:09.989> access<00:04:10.530> routes<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.100> maybe<00:04:11.340> flank

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
different access routes to maybe flank

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.460 
different access routes to maybe flank
your<00:04:11.760> enemy<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.180> what<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.630> they<00:04:12.720> also<00:04:12.930> had<00:04:13.320> it

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
your enemy but what if they also had it

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.070 
your enemy but what if they also had it
on<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> mcom<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.180> let's<00:04:15.360> say<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.750> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
on like it mcom so let's say you and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.900 
on like it mcom so let's say you and
your<00:04:16.320> allies<00:04:16.470> are<00:04:17.010> sure<00:04:17.220> are<00:04:17.370> having<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.700> really

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
your allies are sure are having a really

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.909 
your allies are sure are having a really
hard<00:04:18.000> time<00:04:18.269> pushing<00:04:18.780> up<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.560> m<00:04:19.680> calm

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
hard time pushing up on to the m calm

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.339 
hard time pushing up on to the m calm
but<00:04:20.549> let's<00:04:20.760> say<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.330> building<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
but let's say it's in a building on the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.200 
but let's say it's in a building on the
second<00:04:22.710> floor<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.310> go<00:04:23.460> down<00:04:23.789> into<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
second floor you go down into the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.760 
second floor you go down into the
basement<00:04:24.360> or<00:04:24.660> something<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.110> punch<00:04:25.620> a

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
basement or something like that punch a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.660 
basement or something like that punch a
bunch<00:04:25.979> of

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
bunch of

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.490 
bunch of
made<00:04:26.820> launchers<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.300> there<00:04:27.630> have<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.110> crumble

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
made launchers in there have it crumble

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.590 
made launchers in there have it crumble
to<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.650> ground<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.190> now<00:04:29.610> all<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
to the ground and now all of you and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.360 
to the ground and now all of you and
your<00:04:30.690> buddies<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.230> quickly<00:04:31.470> arm<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.070> mcom

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
your buddies just quickly arm the mcom

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.770 
your buddies just quickly arm the mcom
defendant<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.030> push<00:04:33.180> up<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.570> next

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
defendant and push up on to the next

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.530 
defendant and push up on to the next
objective<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.800> would<00:04:35.310> be<00:04:35.460> really<00:04:35.850> cool<00:04:36.240> that

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
objective that would be really cool that

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.820 
objective that would be really cool that
would<00:04:36.870> be<00:04:36.960> something<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.470> would<00:04:37.590> be

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
would be something that I would be

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.100 
would be something that I would be
interested<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.940> widespread<00:04:39.450> floor

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
interested in but widespread floor

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.650 
interested in but widespread floor
destruction<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.740> don't<00:04:41.070> see<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.640> think<00:04:42.000> maybe<00:04:42.390> in

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
destruction I don't see I think maybe in

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
destruction I don't see I think maybe in
select<00:04:43.140> locations<00:04:43.200> it's<00:04:43.890> definitely

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
select locations it's definitely

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.070 
select locations it's definitely
possible<00:04:44.370> but<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.270> roof<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.630> think<00:04:45.930> that

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
possible but for the roof I think that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.010 
possible but for the roof I think that
is<00:04:46.290> a<00:04:46.320> fair<00:04:46.680> game<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.520> hope<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.210> they<00:04:48.480> do

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
is a fair game and I hope that they do

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.510 
is a fair game and I hope that they do
something<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.280> next<00:04:50.400> question

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
something like that so the next question

something like that so the next question

what's funny about this is that back

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.630 
what's funny about this is that back
when<00:05:16.110> i<00:05:16.140> was<00:05:16.230> playing<00:05:16.530> bad<00:05:16.770> company<00:05:16.980> 2<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.550> we

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
when i was playing bad company 2 and we

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.130 
when i was playing bad company 2 and we
were<00:05:17.730> all<00:05:17.880> learning<00:05:18.120> about<00:05:18.450> battlefield<00:05:18.840> 3

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
were all learning about battlefield 3

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.480 
were all learning about battlefield 3
we're<00:05:19.290> all<00:05:19.440> getting<00:05:19.650> really<00:05:19.860> excited<00:05:20.340> i

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
we're all getting really excited i

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.490 
we're all getting really excited i
distinctly<00:05:21.360> remember<00:05:21.690> maybe<00:05:22.200> I'm<00:05:22.380> going

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
distinctly remember maybe I'm going

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.100 
distinctly remember maybe I'm going
crazy<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.850> dice<00:05:24.030> developer<00:05:24.540> said<00:05:24.780> that

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
crazy that a dice developer said that

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.200 
crazy that a dice developer said that
because<00:05:25.260> their<00:05:25.800> maps<00:05:26.070> are<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.550> large<00:05:26.820> that

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
because their maps are so large that

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.750 
because their maps are so large that
they<00:05:27.840> would<00:05:28.230> be<00:05:28.350> able<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.650> have<00:05:28.860> more<00:05:29.520> variety

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
they would be able to have more variety

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.550 
they would be able to have more variety
for<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.360> team<00:05:30.600> deathmatch<00:05:30.990> because<00:05:31.290> they<00:05:31.410> could

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
for a team deathmatch because they could

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.740 
for a team deathmatch because they could
place<00:05:31.800> these<00:05:32.040> arenas<00:05:32.430> on<00:05:32.760> different<00:05:33.420> sections

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
place these arenas on different sections

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.050 
place these arenas on different sections
of<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.900> map<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.260> so<00:05:34.470> while<00:05:35.070> we<00:05:35.640> all<00:05:35.670> know<00:05:36.030> that

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
of the map and so while we all know that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.570 
of the map and so while we all know that
that<00:05:36.480> didn't<00:05:36.750> happen<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.230> was<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.040> little

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
that didn't happen I was a little

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.790 
that didn't happen I was a little
disappointed<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.420> what<00:05:40.020> makes<00:05:40.140> me<00:05:40.290> sad<00:05:40.500> is

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
disappointed and what makes me sad is

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.350 
disappointed and what makes me sad is
that<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.250> think<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.940> they're<00:05:42.060> going<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.270> be

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
that I think that they're going to be

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.510 
that I think that they're going to be
sticking<00:05:42.780> with<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.170> same<00:05:43.200> policy<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.310> that's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
sticking with the same policy and that's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180 
sticking with the same policy and that's
mainly<00:05:45.240> due<00:05:45.690> in<00:05:45.810> part<00:05:45.840> because<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.770> would<00:05:47.010> just

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
mainly due in part because it would just

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.730 
mainly due in part because it would just
extend<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.150> development<00:05:48.870> time<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.230> mean<00:05:49.530> dice

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
extend the development time I mean dice

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.530 
extend the development time I mean dice

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
for time they're not going to spend even

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.470 
for time they're not going to spend even
more<00:05:57.690> just<00:05:58.350> putting<00:05:58.650> in<00:05:58.860> different<00:05:59.790> sections

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
of maps for team deathmatch I would be

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.150 
of maps for team deathmatch I would be
thrilled<00:06:03.030> if<00:06:03.330> I'm<00:06:03.660> completely<00:06:04.200> wrong<00:06:04.500> but<00:06:04.740> I

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
thrilled if I'm completely wrong but I

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.470 
thrilled if I'm completely wrong but I
have<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.460> feeling<00:06:05.730> that<00:06:05.940> they<00:06:06.210> are<00:06:06.300> going<00:06:06.330> to

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
stick with the same policy like they did
