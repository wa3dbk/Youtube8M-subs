let's talk about space food in the early
days<00:00:05.480> of<00:00:05.750> space<00:00:05.990> exploration<00:00:06.910> food<00:00:07.910> was

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
days of space exploration food was

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.440 
days of space exploration food was
mostly<00:00:08.780> squeezed<00:00:09.560> data<00:00:09.800> tubes<00:00:10.130> and<00:00:11.060> brought

mostly squeezed data tubes and brought

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.070 
mostly squeezed data tubes and brought
up<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:11.690> dehydrating<00:00:12.290> packets<00:00:13.120> but<00:00:14.120> today<00:00:14.420> we

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
up the dehydrating packets but today we

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.349 
up the dehydrating packets but today we

consume on earth that we have here in
space<00:00:20.300> he<00:00:20.720> just<00:00:20.749> needs<00:00:21.109> some<00:00:21.349> minor

adaptations<00:00:22.810> in<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.960> case<00:00:24.169> of<00:00:24.470> sandwiches

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
adaptations in the case of sandwiches

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.239 
adaptations in the case of sandwiches
we<00:00:26.210> had<00:00:26.329> to<00:00:26.449> substitute<00:00:26.659> for<00:00:27.109> bread<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.220> we

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
we had to substitute for bread so we

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.630 
we had to substitute for bread so we
decided<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:28.789> use<00:00:28.909> tortillas<00:00:29.479> but<00:00:30.199> why<00:00:30.640> mostly

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
decided to use tortillas but why mostly

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.099 
decided to use tortillas but why mostly
it's<00:00:31.759> because<00:00:31.880> bread<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.539> course<00:00:32.570> makes

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
it's because bread of course makes
