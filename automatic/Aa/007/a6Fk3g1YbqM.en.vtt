 to continue with the program and that follows 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.160
 yes because here notice Mr. framework 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.390
 zelaya is a historian is a chronicler 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.560
 has yes man a very man 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.440
 smart very prepared and this one us 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.570
 he talked about something related to the temple 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.510
 there is a temple that is called the temple of 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.550
 san diego there in pitiquito and that has 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.250
 caused astonishment the fact that inside 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.640
 of a church are drawings of devils 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.970
 of death so you say you are 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.690
 Satanic stuff for here Mr. 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.090
 marco zelaya explains us extensively about 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.740
 what is involved here do they have it because the 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.690
 people's expectation when it comes 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.150
 here to this temple because first 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.360
 as you said look at the devil the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.520
 only temple is but 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.020
 that all this is a catechesis with 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.260
 which in those times there was no 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.240
 book the Franciscan friars painted 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.490
 all these figures that come in the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.220
 Bible 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.310
 if we realize the words that 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.530
 says in the head the devil says to 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.069
 Lord alone to Lord God the only 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.509
 you will worship and serve this we are 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.789
 meaning there is not a 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.770
 catechesis that between the god there is 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.319
 to serve and love above all and about 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.860
 Yet no one knows who painted him but 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:53.250
 no one in these paintings appeared in 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:06:00.150
 1966 the temple was started by the friar 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:04.319
 franciscan Antonio Ramos in 1783 and he 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.979
 ended in 1792 and as they discovered 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:10.289
 these paintings then in those times 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.840
 despite cleaning the wall of the 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.300
 temples for a wedding that would go to 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.699
 from that wedding they began to 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.610
 first appear the skeleton 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.949
 human that appears and already after 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.580
 They were appearing and other figures and 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:29.370
 for 1985 and adelina wine and response and 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.229
 took out more more paintings in which the 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.039
 people when the devil is appearing and 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.180
 the 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.300
 they thought it was 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.669
 presage of something bad but then it 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.930
 they were getting used to that to the extent 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.580
 that happened the time they were appearing 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.400
 plus 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.100
 Paulette then that's what attracts 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.530
 tourists the devil and he is that the 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.000
 legend true legend is and we see 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.300
 also the legend that has the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.949
 human skeleton says mnp that peking or 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.680
 be the words when the king's son 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:01.620
 profane nabucodonosor the sacred vessels 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.240
 that he like the temple of jerusalem and 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.300
 they appeared on the wall of those words 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.720
 what does he want to say your kingdom will be 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.820
 measured will be heavy and will be divided there 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.020
 also reminds us that in 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.020
 this life are passing 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.140
 and
