00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello how about thanks for being with me 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.930
 in this tutorial we will talk about the criterion 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 of divisibility of number 9 and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.269
 number 10 with this tutorial we give 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 finalized by both the series of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 tutorials where we explain the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.910
 theoretical concepts needed to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 master all the criteria of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 most important divisibility remember 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 that the divisibility criteria more 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 important were the numbers 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 smaller cousins specifically were 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.410
 the numbers 2 3 5 7 11 and 13 but also 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 also in other tutorials I explained 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 the divisibility criteria of the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 smaller numbers that are not cousins 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 the criteria specifically of the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.129
 numbers 4 6 8 and with this tutorial 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 We will finish with the criteria of the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.190
 numbers 9 and 10 at the end of this tutorial 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 I will leave you a series of links where 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 you can easily choose the criterion 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 of divisibility that you want to see if 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.110
 come the case you need 6 see 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.300
 any of the previous tutorials 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.190
 that's why 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 we will explain the criteria of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.150
 number 9 and number 10 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 the number divisibility criterion 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.440
 9 tells us that for any number 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.299
 is divisible by the number 9 the sum of 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.090
 the figures that make up the number have 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.080
 that being a multiple of 9 we started with 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.270
 a first example with the number 1044 what 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.970
 that we must realize is the sum of 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 all the digits that make up this number 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.470
 in this case we have 4 digits that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.350
 they form the number 1000 44 therefore 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.789
 we will have to add the number 1 plus the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.899
 number 0 plus the number 4 plus the number 4 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.330
 if the sum gives a multiple of 9 we will say 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.899
 that this number is divisible by the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.450
 number 9 10 plus 4 4 results in the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.819
 number 9 so the number 9 is 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.880
 multiple of the number 9 since all the 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.000
 numbers are multiples of itself by 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 we can say that in 1,044 it is 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.239
 divisible by the number 9 we continue 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.610
 with the second example with the number 927 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.269
 let's make the sum of all the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.810
 digits that make up the number 927 by 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.690
 we will have to add the number 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:27.650
 9 plus the number 2 plus the number 7 9 2 11 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.200
 more 7 18 if you remember the table of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.480
 multiply we know that the number 9 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.819
 multiplied by the number two gives as 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.910
 result the number 18 so we can 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.690
 say that number 18 is a multiple 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.599
 of number 9 as the sum of the three 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.430
 figures that make up the number 927 gives as 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.550
 result a multiple of the number 9 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.970
 we can say that the number 927 is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.830
 divisible by the number 9 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.470
 We continue with the criterion of 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.270
 divisibility of number 10 the statement 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.730
 of the number divisibility criterion 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.640
 10 tells us that for any 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.920
 number is divisible by the number 10 the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.790
 last of the figures that make up our 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.860
 number has to be a number 0 look 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.530
 in the examples shown on the screen 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.560
 we have the number 100 the last number 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.500
 ends in 0 therefore it is divisible by 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.650
 the number 10 the number 20 ends in 0 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.890
 therefore it is divisible by the number 10 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.440
 the number 30 ends in 0 so it is 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.500
 divisible by the number 10 the number 40 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.610
 ends in 0 therefore it is divisible by 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.430
 the number 10 and the number 10,000 ends 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.560
 in 0 therefore it is divisible by the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.390
 number 10 good guys so here we have 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.000
 finalized the criteria 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.390
 divisibility of number 9 and number 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.550
 10 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.520
 I hope you liked all the 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.410
 examples and explanations made at 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.780
 throughout all the criteria of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.970
 divisibility then in the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.280
 next screen I will leave you a series of 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.720
 links to the multiple tutorials 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.600
 that I have made with the various 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.920
 divisibility criteria a greeting to 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.920
 all and see you soon
