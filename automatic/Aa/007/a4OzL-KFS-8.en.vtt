00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello I was with the ai today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 therefore, would integrate from sabic 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 Many thanks for that I hope that you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 do not like you much fun 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 okay the first question is what is yours 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.880
 favorite lip care product and there 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 I just had to go with this goal of mine 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.320
 plastic together that i do not mind 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 am absolutely convinced so I you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 say can indeed get going you buy the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 so it's okay but I have 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 actually nothing real problem with 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 dry life so mine by nature 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.660
 very supple and therefore all at 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 us this animal but it will be 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 not necessarily so recommended for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 the second question is what then all 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 dearest heart activity and i love you 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 more than when I came home just 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.230
 to put on my bathrobe like me in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 to cuddle my bed and yes no 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.370
 to watch videos and comments 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 to read on your tweets to answer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 Yesterday I played so much has 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 that I have reached here with it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.719
 i would have to research i have so many 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.149
 tweets do not ship that anymore 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 I could not kill that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.520
 necessarily so cool I have only times 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 before upright root something is yes but 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.189
 that some mothers really like it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 I did not even get out and then 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.600
 love it just to be still in it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.540
 in the warm I cuddle in my bed 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 and yes , here is the third question 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 your favorite drink in the fall so im 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 summer they would not have that there 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.100
 What the band especially we have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 fought but i just got it now 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.650
 something drunk and that's why I have 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.130
 not to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 a favorite drink but what I give you 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.670
 like a prisoner, you can totally relax 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 this mix is sometime jakob 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.979
 as well as the cafÃ© with milka chocolate 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.500
 in there and there is just so cool 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.869
 strictly daily and above all 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 in colder days and then I take it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.650
 I just drink from a wise way 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.830
 I do not know I drink 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.410
 always my cocoa or coffee or tea 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 from my keys and I love that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.860
 and yes I can really get to you 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.450
 heart a prophet is necessarily out of case 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.980
 you 've never tried that because 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.740
 he just tastes divine 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.180
 okay the next question is nothing candle 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.920
 in autumn and thus a new one 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.570
 smell direction I'm so happy 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.320
 switch it on with me 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.330
 america was and is just sooo cool 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.850
 I give him these cash associations at the oct 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 and this chain really horny right 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.000
 that now the scent direction 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.520
 marshmallow leisure and that 's it 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.070
 just as cute and as if you were on 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.780
 Stock field with marshmallows roast and 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.880
 i just love that when i do that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.430
 others ignite i already have those too 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.790
 pretty much they used with me 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.560
 you just recently and that smells 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.180
 just right so I'm happy 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.760
 me if I'm my america 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.620
 then I will buy this store empty 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.230
 if you that to him 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.500
 such candles get easy at these 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.150
 awesome and fifth question is what is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.820
 clicked accessoire or already in 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.070
 autumn and I love you just 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.800
 to wear such caps as, for example, 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:16.110
 once this one kept it so gray 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:20.610
 cap that is of course from h &amp; m or 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:26.250
 such dollars must be the city of world 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.800
 I also like yvonne better than 20 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.180
 bands and everything that can count 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.400
 i just love especially when you are 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.140
 have once again really cool colors 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.850
 because the makers of good long was me 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.500
 I do not know why but I love it against 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.040
 not to wear the colorful socks with it 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.420
 always 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:49.980
 and think you asked question haunted house 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.570
 ghost train or ghost labyrinth becomes 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.600
 It is difficult to know once in one 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.850
 Ghost Train and was really right 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.770
 cheap as that with 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.030
 this car and akw such a by 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.340
 a mask on and then has of the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.750
 Cola bottle on the stomach I hewn 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.840
 do not know exactly what they are doing 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.000
 thought that was not so 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.580
 scary but we have none 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.560
 I think so I think I think so 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.090
 a reason really cool but right 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.040
 Not alone because it's way too much fun 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.840
 I am at this real shot so 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.290
 I was really scared right 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.570
 and I 'm thinking of myself at the back 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.740
 then out of any people 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.250
 will 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.970
 but otherwise it was completely broken 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.980
 very cool 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.740
 So I like stuff like that, too 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.190
 such a real star I'm okay 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.240
 seventh question is darling to offer 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.460
 I think I do not know such a thing now 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.160
 especially two keeps that way 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.920
 horror movies about it really sure 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.220
 but if it's the white last, too 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.630
 I did not hope I had a look 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.210
 So that with this mask and that 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.620
 case is quite good so in the beginning I 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.770
 knows exactly which one looked at 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.940
 at the beginning , people have caught up and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.820
 Often that was so cool but later than 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.880
 His action occurred and he 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.670
 not only stabbed people then found 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.130
 I the actually quite good so there 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.720
 really interesting because my bodyguard 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.420
 know which of these mask is 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.880
 and yes, what else do I have 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.830
 yet I have more in last time 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.560
 but not the American 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.240
 version but the Japanese so the 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.670
 original version how are you still up 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.210
 Japanese did not look at me why so 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.830
 technically most advanced illogical 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.350
 and the wrong possible really 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.430
 creepy so I 'm way too 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.170
 complicated I did not feel like it 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.930
 correctly understood that I am afraid 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.200
 could the eighth question which kyte 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.350
 is you in the fall respectively 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.300
 most of all a real heat 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.780
 We do not celebrate this here 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.520
 as big as now in america but me 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.730
