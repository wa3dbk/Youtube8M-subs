teach<00:00:42.030> me<00:00:42.149> everything<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.079> right

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.029 

and<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.110> beachy<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and this is a very beachy not because I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.360 
and this is a very beachy not because I
work<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> enjoin<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> arm<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> flew

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
work to enjoin to the arm and if I flew

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.709 
work to enjoin to the arm and if I flew
you<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.820> position<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.360> I'll<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.629> me

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you from this position which I'll let me

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
you from this position which I'll let me
show<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> throw

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
show you it would not only have a throw

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.420 
show you it would not only have a throw
but<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> shoulder<00:00:57.510> dislocation

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
but it would be a shoulder dislocation

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.619 
but it would be a shoulder dislocation
this<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> neutralization

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
this would be one of the neutralization

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
this would be one of the neutralization
techniques<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.260> am<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.590> move<00:01:01.949> on

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
techniques but what am I can move on

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
techniques but what am I can move on
dinga<00:01:02.399> techniques<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:03.229> but<00:01:04.229> let's<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
dinga techniques right but let's just

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.429 
dinga techniques right but let's just
drive<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> let's<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.790> patient

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
drive it let's try a very patient

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.450 
drive it let's try a very patient
there's<00:01:07.439> no<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.860> shake<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.100> sentiment

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
there's no is gonna shake my sentiment

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
there's no is gonna shake my sentiment
right<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:09.930> steps<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> shake<00:01:10.590> my

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
right so when these steps in to shake my

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
right so when these steps in to shake my
hand<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.540> watch<00:01:12.750> say

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
hand first is that I gonna watch say

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
hand first is that I gonna watch say
that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:13.500> wanna<00:01:13.650> hang<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.299> to

you at watches and that's where he's

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.200 
you at watches and that's where he's
uncomfortable<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:06.340> course<00:02:06.580> from<00:02:06.820> here<00:02:07.060> I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
uncomfortable and of course from here I

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.510 
uncomfortable and of course from here I
can<00:02:07.240> do<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:08.680> types<00:02:08.980> of<00:02:09.160> things<00:02:11.520> right

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
can do different types of things right

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.100 
can do different types of things right
we'll<00:02:13.030> get<00:02:13.150> there<00:02:13.390> let's<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.810> wristlock

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
we'll get there let's do the wristlock

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.000 
we'll get there let's do the wristlock
first<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.950> grab<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.060> point<00:02:16.300> eating<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.830> go<00:02:17.830> the
