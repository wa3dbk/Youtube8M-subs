okay<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.719> vaccinations<00:00:40.440> very<00:00:40.680> important<00:00:41.100> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
okay so vaccinations very important in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
okay so vaccinations very important in
preventing<00:00:41.460> disease<00:00:41.870> we<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> couple

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
preventing disease we got a couple

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.299 
preventing disease we got a couple
categories<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.190> vaccines<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.719> for

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
categories of vaccines one for

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.139 
categories of vaccines one for
respiratory<00:00:47.309> diseases<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.360> another<00:00:49.260> for

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
respiratory diseases and another for

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
respiratory diseases and another for
Clostridium<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> other<00:00:51.510> top<00:00:51.780> bacterial

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
Clostridium and other top bacterial

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.880 
Clostridium and other top bacterial
diseases<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.149> broad<00:00:54.420> categories

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
diseases so that's two broad categories

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
diseases so that's two broad categories
so<00:00:55.890> typically<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> viruses<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so typically the viruses that we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
so typically the viruses that we
vaccinate<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.160> BR<00:00:59.930> pi3<00:01:00.960> B<00:01:01.620> RSV<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> BB

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
vaccinate for are I BR pi3 B RSV and BB

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.469 
vaccinate for are I BR pi3 B RSV and BB
D<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:04.140> these<00:01:04.320> reps<00:01:04.710> respiratory<00:01:05.610> viruses<00:01:06.210> are

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
D but these reps respiratory viruses are

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
D but these reps respiratory viruses are
very<00:01:07.290> important<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> vaccinate<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> show

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
very important to vaccinate for and show

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
very important to vaccinate for and show
animals<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.540> traveling<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.110> exposed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
animals that are traveling and exposed

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
animals that are traveling and exposed
to<00:01:10.710> large<00:01:10.890> populations<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> animals<00:01:12.000> because

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to large populations of animals because

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
to large populations of animals because
that's<00:01:12.869> where<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.229> pick<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:13.860> things

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that's where they pick up these things

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.609 
that's where they pick up these things
the<00:01:14.880> main<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> these<00:01:15.840> animals<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the main thing in these animals is to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.890 
the main thing in these animals is to
start<00:01:16.890> early<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.000> properly<00:01:18.420> booster

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
start early and to properly booster

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
start early and to properly booster
their<00:01:19.049> vaccine<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.250> purchase<00:01:20.670> them

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
their vaccine so if you purchase them

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
their vaccine so if you purchase them
from<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> reputable<00:01:21.479> breeder<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
from a reputable breeder you want to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
from a reputable breeder you want to
make<00:01:23.189> sure<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:23.869> vaccinated<00:01:24.869> prior

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
make sure that they're vaccinated prior

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
make sure that they're vaccinated prior
to<00:01:25.259> picking<00:01:25.409> them<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.250> have

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
to picking them up so you don't have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
to picking them up so you don't have
sickness<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.030> hauling<00:01:27.509> them<00:01:27.600> home<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
sickness on hauling them home and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
sickness on hauling them home and
getting<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.829> into<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.189> environment

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
getting them into a new environment

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.719 
getting them into a new environment
blackleg<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.470> another<00:01:31.829> important<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.490> it's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
blackleg is another important one it's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
blackleg is another important one it's
whole<00:01:32.939> category<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> Clostridium<00:01:33.900> diseases

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
whole category of Clostridium diseases

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.420 
whole category of Clostridium diseases
they<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> cause<00:01:36.150> sudden<00:01:36.479> death<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.530> bugs

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
they can cause sudden death these bugs

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
they can cause sudden death these bugs
live<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> dirt<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> form<00:01:40.110> from<00:01:40.409> spores

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
live in the dirt and form from spores

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
live in the dirt and form from spores
and<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.579> they're<00:01:42.150> always<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> always<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and so they're always there and always a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
and so they're always there and always a
big<00:01:43.619> threat<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> give<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.299> least

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
big threat so you want to give at least

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
vaccines again even if they've had them

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.940

really<00:02:19.580> well<00:02:20.269> one<00:02:20.480> thing<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.720> people<00:02:20.959> do

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
really well one thing that people do

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.710 
really well one thing that people do
need<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.709> obviously<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.489> they<00:02:23.480> need<00:02:23.660> to
