looking all of these are on the maximum

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.859 
looking all of these are on the maximum
brightness<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.720> able<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
brightness and you might not be able to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.359 
brightness and you might not be able to
tell<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.380> much<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> video<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.189> right<00:01:38.310> here

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
tell as much in the video but right here

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
tell as much in the video but right here
we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.729> tell<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.860> ok<00:01:40.860> better<00:01:41.369> best<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.540> get

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
we can tell it's ok better best you get

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
we can tell it's ok better best you get
the<00:01:42.930> brightest<00:01:43.380> screen<00:01:43.649> over<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the brightest screen over here and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
the brightest screen over here and
there's<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.240> different<00:01:45.420> screen<00:01:45.810> technology

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there's some different screen technology

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
there's some different screen technology
in<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.250> outside<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
in here so that when I go outside the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.069 
in here so that when I go outside the
screen<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.270> automatically<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.840> brighter

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
screen will automatically get brighter

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
screen will automatically get brighter
there's<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:49.890> ultra<00:01:50.310> dimming<00:01:50.729> mode<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
there's an ultra dimming mode and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
there's an ultra dimming mode and
there's<00:01:52.020> even<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> mode<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
there's even a mode that will make this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.179 
there's even a mode that will make this
screen<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.509> black<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> white<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> your

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
screen go black and white so that your

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.450 
screen go black and white so that your
battery<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:56.670> last<00:01:56.700> much<00:01:57.299> much<00:01:57.360> longer<00:01:58.460> now

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
battery will last much much longer now

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
battery will last much much longer now
the<00:01:59.909> other<00:02:00.119> differences<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.619> all

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the other differences that we see we all

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
the other differences that we see we all
have<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.130> same<00:02:02.340> home<00:02:02.939> button<00:02:03.299> physical

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
have this same home button physical

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
have this same home button physical
button<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.399> galaxy<00:02:05.729> s5<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.420> a

little bit nicer to get to Google now if

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.080 
little bit nicer to get to Google now if

you use that service if you hold this
it's<00:02:43.270> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> Google<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:44.260> and

I can just say ok Google ok Google and
it<00:02:50.950> will<00:02:51.070> open<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.700> can't<00:02:51.940> do<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.270> for

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
it will open up I can't do that for

it will open up I can't do that for

either of these these phones if I hold
this<00:02:54.490> down<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.690> tap<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.920> get<00:02:57.040> to

this down and then tap I can get to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
tap and get to Google now so that's a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.340 
tap and get to Google now so that's a
little<00:03:04.930> bit<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.410> different<00:03:06.190> thing<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:07.350> in

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
little bit of a different thing there in

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.830 
little bit of a different thing there in
terms<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.480> design<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:12.100> see<00:03:12.130> an<00:03:12.610> upgrade<00:03:13.600> as

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
terms of the design we see an upgrade as

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.440 
terms of the design we see an upgrade as
we<00:03:14.440> move<00:03:14.890> through<00:03:15.160> each<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.460> these<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:16.240> is<00:03:16.300> a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
we move through each of these this is a

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.110 
we move through each of these this is a
very<00:03:16.750> very<00:03:17.350> plasticky<00:03:18.040> design<00:03:18.370> one<00:03:18.940> that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
very very plasticky design one that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.450 
very very plasticky design one that
Samsung<00:03:19.330> was<00:03:19.780> given<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.200> lot<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.680> lot<00:03:21.310> of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
Samsung was given a lot of a lot of

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.390 
Samsung was given a lot of a lot of
attention<00:03:22.300> for<00:03:22.660> not<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> positive<00:03:23.440> way<00:03:23.890> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
attention for not in a positive way and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520 
attention for not in a positive way and
it<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:24.790> doesn't<00:03:25.000> feel<00:03:25.270> real<00:03:25.480> great<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.380> with

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
it just doesn't feel real great now with

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.700 
it just doesn't feel real great now with
the<00:03:26.620> galaxy<00:03:26.980> s4<00:03:27.340> they<00:03:27.550> upgraded<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.380> new<00:03:29.380> mix

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.270 
the galaxy s4 they upgraded to a new mix
or<00:03:29.980> blend<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.520> plastic<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.510> there's<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.750> slight

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
or blend of plastic and there's a slight

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.890 
or blend of plastic and there's a slight
crosshatch<00:03:33.280> design<00:03:33.310> there<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.600> feels

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
crosshatch design there this feels

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.400 
crosshatch design there this feels
better<00:03:35.080> than<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.530> s3<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.910> s5<00:03:37.270> now<00:03:37.660> has<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> soft

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
better than the s3 the s5 now has a soft

better than the s3 the s5 now has a soft
touch<00:03:38.740> plastic<00:03:39.550> this<00:03:39.820> white<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.360> actually<00:03:40.690> an

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
touch plastic this white is actually an

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
touch plastic this white is actually an
off-white<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.680> may<00:03:41.920> be<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.100> turn-off<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
off-white so that may be a turn-off you

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.280 
off-white so that may be a turn-off you
might<00:03:42.910> want<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> go<00:03:43.150> with<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.330> black<00:03:43.600> one<00:03:43.840> or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
might want to go with the black one or

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.250 
might want to go with the black one or
hold<00:03:44.530> out<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:44.920> an<00:03:44.980> electric<00:03:45.370> blue<00:03:45.750> model<00:03:46.750> but

hold out for an electric blue model but

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.720 
hold out for an electric blue model but
this<00:03:47.440> definitely<00:03:47.710> feels<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.100> lot<00:03:48.220> better<00:03:48.370> a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
this definitely feels a lot better a

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.390 
this definitely feels a lot better a
little<00:03:48.880> easier<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.390> get<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> grip<00:03:50.220> speakers<00:03:51.220> on

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.570 
the s5 on the top you get an IR port and
so<00:04:07.030> what<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.630> do<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:08.020> this<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.580> control

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
so what you can do with this is control

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.270 
so what you can do with this is control
your<00:04:09.820> HDTV<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:11.440> something<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:12.040> you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
your HDTV that's something that you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.550 
your HDTV that's something that you
don't<00:04:12.610> find<00:04:12.880> on<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.209> galaxy<00:04:13.630> s3<00:04:13.750> headphones

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
don't find on the galaxy s3 headphones

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.870 
don't find on the galaxy s3 headphones
are<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.740> top<00:04:14.980> for<00:04:15.220> all<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.430> them<00:04:16.500> camera<00:04:17.500> wise

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
are on top for all of them camera wise

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560 
are on top for all of them camera wise
we<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.500> 16<00:04:20.500> megapixel<00:04:21.060> camera<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.450> can

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
we have a 16 megapixel camera you can

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.190 
we have a 16 megapixel camera you can
shoot<00:04:22.720> 4k<00:04:23.020> video<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.830> 10

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
shoot 4k video and 10

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.310 
shoot 4k video and 10
P<00:04:24.350> video<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:25.520> does<00:04:25.730> 1080p<00:04:26.180> video<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.900> I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
P video this does 1080p video and I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.260 
P video this does 1080p video and I
believe<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:29.980> 13<00:04:30.980> megapixel<00:04:31.460> camera<00:04:31.850> I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
believe this is a 13 megapixel camera I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.910 
believe this is a 13 megapixel camera I
may<00:04:32.450> be<00:04:32.510> wrong<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.080> check<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.470> comments

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
may be wrong on that check the comments

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.270 
may be wrong on that check the comments
and<00:04:34.100> then<00:04:34.970> we<00:04:35.150> on<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.540> one<00:04:35.720> we<00:04:36.170> have<00:04:36.380> an<00:04:36.710> older

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
and then we on this one we have an older

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.490 
and then we on this one we have an older
camera<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:37.910> if<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> again<00:04:39.170> check<00:04:39.380> the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
camera and if you again check the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.110 
camera and if you again check the
description<00:04:39.920> we're<00:04:40.010> going<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.220> have<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.640> shoot

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
description we're going to have a shoot

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.820 
description we're going to have a shoot
out<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.510> show<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.810> what<00:04:42.290> these<00:04:42.470> look<00:04:42.530> like

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
out to show you what these look like

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.220 
out to show you what these look like
what<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.880> photos<00:04:44.210> look<00:04:44.360> like<00:04:44.390> on<00:04:44.750> each<00:04:45.080> of

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
what the photos look like on each of

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.680 
what the photos look like on each of
these<00:04:45.350> different<00:04:45.620> devices<00:04:46.040> now<00:04:46.910> on<00:04:47.270> all<00:04:47.510> of

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
these different devices now on all of

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.740 
these different devices now on all of
these<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.110> can<00:04:48.380> peel<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.010> back<00:04:49.220> off<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:52.750> this

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
these you can peel the back off and this

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.750 
these you can peel the back off and this
is<00:04:53.900> kind<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.230> Samsung<00:04:55.240> trademark<00:04:56.240> feature

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
is kind of a Samsung trademark feature

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.440 
is kind of a Samsung trademark feature
that<00:04:58.760> allows<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.270> access<00:04:59.510> to<00:05:00.520> two<00:05:01.520> key<00:05:02.030> things

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
that allows you access to two key things

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.400 
that allows you access to two key things
so<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.470> can<00:05:03.710> stick<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.250> microSD<00:05:05.060> card<00:05:05.090> in<00:05:05.660> each<00:05:06.260> of

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
so I can stick a microSD card in each of

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.990 
so I can stick a microSD card in each of
these<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.800> add<00:05:06.890> more<00:05:07.100> storage<00:05:07.340> which<00:05:07.670> is<00:05:07.700> good

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
these to add more storage which is good

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.940 
these to add more storage which is good
because<00:05:08.180> usually<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.110> storage<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.740> buy<00:05:09.890> it

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
because usually the storage you buy it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.490 
because usually the storage you buy it
with<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.430> limited<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.270> what<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.050> can<00:05:12.200> also<00:05:12.320> do

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
with is limited and what I can also do

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.110 
with is limited and what I can also do
is<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.650> can<00:05:12.710> pull<00:05:13.040> these<00:05:13.220> batteries<00:05:13.640> out<00:05:13.850> and

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
is I can pull these batteries out and

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.900 
is I can pull these batteries out and
stick<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:14.990> new<00:05:15.140> battery<00:05:15.350> in<00:05:15.680> now<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.340> battery

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
stick a new battery in now the battery

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.010 
stick a new battery in now the battery
is<00:05:17.210> larger<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.950> galaxy<00:05:19.310> s5<00:05:20.020> cooking

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
is larger in the galaxy s5 cooking

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.600 
is larger in the galaxy s5 cooking
capacity<00:05:21.590> wise<00:05:21.740> even<00:05:22.190> though<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.370> looks<00:05:22.520> a

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
capacity wise even though it looks a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.260 
capacity wise even though it looks a
little<00:05:22.790> bigger<00:05:22.940> and<00:05:23.510> what<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.470> means<00:05:24.650> is

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
little bigger and what that means is

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.430 
little bigger and what that means is
you're<00:05:26.270> gonna<00:05:26.360> get<00:05:26.480> better<00:05:26.660> battery<00:05:26.810> life<00:05:27.050> and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
you're gonna get better battery life and

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.110 
you're gonna get better battery life and
the<00:05:28.010> screen<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:28.400> actually<00:05:28.670> more<00:05:28.910> power

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
the screen is actually more power

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.380 
the screen is actually more power
efficient<00:05:29.570> on<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.810> galaxy<00:05:30.550> s5<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.940> believe

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
efficient on the galaxy s5 I believe

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.380 
efficient on the galaxy s5 I believe
it's<00:05:33.140> about<00:05:33.380> 20%<00:05:34.100> more<00:05:34.400> power<00:05:34.490> efficient<00:05:35.090> so

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
it's about 20% more power efficient so

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.300 
it's about 20% more power efficient so
if<00:05:35.840> both<00:05:36.170> of<00:05:36.200> these<00:05:36.440> screens<00:05:36.800> are<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.100> same

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
if both of these screens are the same

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.670 
if both of these screens are the same
brightness<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:38.540> is<00:05:38.690> going<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.870> use<00:05:38.990> 20%<00:05:39.560> less

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
brightness this is going to use 20% less

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.640 
brightness this is going to use 20% less
power<00:05:39.890> and<00:05:40.160> that's<00:05:40.670> going<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:40.910> translate<00:05:41.210> into

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
power and that's going to translate into

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.440 
power and that's going to translate into
much<00:05:42.650> longer<00:05:42.980> battery<00:05:43.160> life<00:05:43.280> now<00:05:44.240> you'll

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
much longer battery life now you'll

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.270 
much longer battery life now you'll
notice<00:05:44.660> another<00:05:44.930> key<00:05:45.290> difference<00:05:45.650> here<00:05:45.710> when

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
notice another key difference here when

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.360 
notice another key difference here when
we<00:05:46.430> look<00:05:46.640> at<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:46.850> backs<00:05:47.380> there<00:05:48.380> is<00:05:48.650> a<00:05:48.680> small

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
we look at the backs there is a small

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.940 
we look at the backs there is a small
rubber<00:05:50.120> ring<00:05:50.690> in<00:05:50.900> here<00:05:51.200> and<00:05:51.380> that's<00:05:51.770> because

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
rubber ring in here and that's because

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.120 
rubber ring in here and that's because
the<00:05:52.550> Galaxy<00:05:53.240> s5<00:05:53.540> is<00:05:53.950> water-resistant<00:05:54.950> it's

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
the Galaxy s5 is water-resistant it's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.840 
the Galaxy s5 is water-resistant it's
not<00:05:55.280> waterproof

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
not waterproof

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.930 
not waterproof
you<00:05:55.970> cannot<00:05:56.240> go<00:05:57.050> stick<00:05:57.470> this<00:05:57.650> in<00:05:58.010> feet<00:05:58.910> and

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
you cannot go stick this in feet and

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.510 
you cannot go stick this in feet and
feet<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.450> feet<00:05:59.510> of<00:05:59.630> water<00:05:59.930> but<00:06:00.800> it'll<00:06:01.370> handle

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
feet and feet of water but it'll handle

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.670 
feet and feet of water but it'll handle
about<00:06:01.970> three<00:06:02.240> feet<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.510> water<00:06:02.540> for<00:06:03.080> 30<00:06:03.320> minutes

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
about three feet of water for 30 minutes

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.250 
about three feet of water for 30 minutes
so<00:06:04.040> that<00:06:04.340> means<00:06:04.490> if<00:06:04.880> you<00:06:05.630> drop<00:06:05.840> it<00:06:05.960> in<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.080> puddle

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
so that means if you drop it in a puddle

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.230 
so that means if you drop it in a puddle
if<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:07.220> drop<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.610> in<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.850> sink<00:06:08.030> while<00:06:08.090> you're

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
if you drop it in the sink while you're

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.450 
if you drop it in the sink while you're
doing<00:06:08.420> dishes<00:06:08.570> or<00:06:09.050> pretty<00:06:10.040> much<00:06:10.160> all<00:06:10.310> these

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
doing dishes or pretty much all these

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.750 
doing dishes or pretty much all these
little<00:06:10.790> accidents<00:06:11.540> that<00:06:11.720> would<00:06:11.930> otherwise

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
little accidents that would otherwise

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.820 
little accidents that would otherwise
render<00:06:13.760> a<00:06:13.790> phone<00:06:14.090> useless<00:06:14.600> this<00:06:15.260> will<00:06:15.500> survive

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
render a phone useless this will survive

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.110 
render a phone useless this will survive
it<00:06:16.070> as<00:06:16.220> long<00:06:16.370> as<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.580> this<00:06:16.700> back<00:06:16.910> on

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
it as long as you have this back on

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.590 
it as long as you have this back on
tight<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:18.320> little<00:06:18.680> USB<00:06:18.950> thing<00:06:19.460> stuck<00:06:20.390> in

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
tight and the little USB thing stuck in

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.470 
tight and the little USB thing stuck in
there<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:21.440> protect<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:22.210> both<00:06:23.210> of<00:06:23.360> these

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
there to protect that both of these

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.450 
there to protect that both of these
phones<00:06:23.810> don't<00:06:24.080> do<00:06:24.200> that<00:06:24.380> if<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:25.160> want

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
phones don't do that if you want

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.650 
phones don't do that if you want
something<00:06:25.730> like<00:06:25.880> that<00:06:26.030> you're<00:06:26.420> going<00:06:26.540> to<00:06:26.570> have

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
something like that you're going to have

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.290 
something like that you're going to have
to<00:06:26.810> stick<00:06:27.020> one<00:06:27.200> of<00:06:27.290> these<00:06:27.380> phones<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:28.070> a<00:06:28.760> case

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
to stick one of these phones in a case

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.970 
to stick one of these phones in a case
so<00:06:29.600> like<00:06:29.720> we<00:06:29.840> have<00:06:29.930> a<00:06:29.990> lifeproof<00:06:30.410> case<00:06:30.680> here

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
so like we have a lifeproof case here

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.720 
so like we have a lifeproof case here
for<00:06:31.640> the<00:06:31.730> galaxy<00:06:32.150> s3<00:06:32.690> and<00:06:33.550> what's<00:06:34.550> interesting

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
for the galaxy s3 and what's interesting

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.090 
for the galaxy s3 and what's interesting
is<00:06:35.060> once<00:06:35.300> we<00:06:35.420> get<00:06:35.540> this<00:06:35.690> case<00:06:36.020> on

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
is once we get this case on

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.500 
is once we get this case on
we<00:06:37.790> end<00:06:38.000> up<00:06:40.450> we<00:06:41.450> end<00:06:41.630> up<00:06:41.810> with<00:06:42.080> a<00:06:43.000> phone<00:06:44.000> that<00:06:44.030> is

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
we end up we end up with a phone that is

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.630 
we end up we end up with a phone that is
just<00:06:44.960> about<00:06:45.140> as<00:06:45.320> thick<00:06:45.620> as<00:06:46.480> our<00:06:47.480> galaxy<00:06:48.470> s5<00:06:49.400> and

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
just about as thick as our galaxy s5 and

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.220 
just about as thick as our galaxy s5 and
about<00:06:49.970> is<00:06:50.090> BAE<00:06:50.300> my<00:06:50.570> going<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:50.750> snap<00:06:50.930> this<00:06:51.050> in

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
about is BAE my going to snap this in

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.950 
about is BAE my going to snap this in
there<00:06:51.350> right<00:06:51.500> away<00:06:51.560> but<00:06:52.570> that<00:06:53.570> gets<00:06:53.810> you<00:06:53.930> a

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
there right away but that gets you a

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.840 
there right away but that gets you a
little<00:06:54.230> bit<00:06:54.470> more<00:06:54.620> protection<00:06:55.220> than<00:06:55.400> these

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
little bit more protection than these

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.300 
little bit more protection than these
phones<00:06:56.240> or<00:06:57.050> than<00:06:57.230> just<00:06:57.590> this<00:06:57.740> phone<00:06:58.010> on<00:06:58.190> its

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
phones or than just this phone on its

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.490 
phones or than just this phone on its
own<00:06:58.400> so<00:06:58.640> some<00:06:59.300> people<00:06:59.540> still<00:06:59.870> may<00:06:59.990> have<00:07:00.170> a<00:07:00.200> need

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
own so some people still may have a need

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.840 
own so some people still may have a need
for<00:07:01.040> a<00:07:01.660> case<00:07:02.660> even<00:07:03.020> on<00:07:03.110> the<00:07:03.200> galaxy<00:07:03.530> s5<00:07:03.850> but

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
for a case even on the galaxy s5 but

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.780 
for a case even on the galaxy s5 but
that's<00:07:05.720> a<00:07:05.810> quick<00:07:06.110> look<00:07:06.350> at<00:07:06.530> the<00:07:07.040> differences

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
that's a quick look at the differences

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.760 
that's a quick look at the differences
between<00:07:08.030> these<00:07:08.540> devices<00:07:08.750> now<00:07:09.290> again<00:07:09.590> there's

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
between these devices now again there's

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.470 
between these devices now again there's
going<00:07:09.860> to<00:07:09.920> be<00:07:09.980> performance<00:07:10.520> differences<00:07:11.060> and

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
going to be performance differences and

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.600 
going to be performance differences and
this<00:07:12.020> is<00:07:12.230> the<00:07:12.530> galaxy<00:07:12.860> s3<00:07:13.130> is<00:07:13.220> going<00:07:13.340> to<00:07:13.400> run<00:07:13.520> an

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
going to get fewer updates at this point
