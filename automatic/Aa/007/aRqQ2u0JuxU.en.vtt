we<00:00:11.709> thought<00:00:11.920> the<00:00:12.160> best<00:00:12.400> thing<00:00:12.580> that<00:00:12.730> we<00:00:12.910> could

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
we thought the best thing that we could

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.910 
we thought the best thing that we could
possibly<00:00:13.599> do<00:00:13.840> is<00:00:13.869> to<00:00:14.230> listen<00:00:14.410> to<00:00:14.590> what

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
possibly do is to listen to what

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.380 
possibly do is to listen to what
communities<00:00:15.430> around<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:15.910> country<00:00:15.939> are<00:00:16.359> doing

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
communities around the country are doing

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.689 
communities around the country are doing
because<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.590> feel<00:00:17.830> that<00:00:17.859> there's<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.220> lot<00:00:18.519> of

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
because we feel that there's a lot of

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.700 
because we feel that there's a lot of
community<00:00:19.150> level<00:00:19.480> resilience<00:00:19.960> we<00:00:20.410> have<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.529> lot

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
community level resilience we have a lot

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.350 
community level resilience we have a lot
of<00:00:20.740> storytelling<00:00:21.490> events<00:00:22.000> where<00:00:22.180> we've

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
of storytelling events where we've

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.600 
of storytelling events where we've
provided<00:00:22.720> communities<00:00:23.350> with<00:00:23.560> prompts<00:00:24.070> such

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
provided communities with prompts such

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.029 
provided communities with prompts such
as<00:00:24.880> what<00:00:25.420> sustains<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:26.140> or<00:00:26.410> what<00:00:26.710> keeps<00:00:26.920> you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
as what sustains you or what keeps you

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.189 
as what sustains you or what keeps you
up<00:00:27.160> at<00:00:27.250> night<00:00:27.310> or<00:00:27.699> what<00:00:28.240> is<00:00:28.330> something<00:00:28.510> that<00:00:28.660> we

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
up at night or what is something that we

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.600 
up at night or what is something that we
need<00:00:29.350> to<00:00:29.470> know<00:00:29.619> about<00:00:29.830> your<00:00:30.130> community<00:00:30.580> and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
need to know about your community and

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.189 
need to know about your community and
environmental<00:00:31.240> issues<00:00:31.510> in<00:00:31.539> your<00:00:31.720> community

environmental issues in your community

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.660 
environmental issues in your community
or<00:00:32.230> social<00:00:32.710> justice<00:00:32.739> issues<00:00:33.399> in<00:00:33.579> your

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
or social justice issues in your

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.700 
or social justice issues in your
community<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.539> bus<00:00:34.809> was<00:00:34.989> previously<00:00:35.440> set<00:00:35.680> up

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
community the bus was previously set up

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.740 
community the bus was previously set up
to<00:00:35.920> run<00:00:36.039> on<00:00:36.129> waste<00:00:36.370> vegetable<00:00:36.579> oil<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.629> this

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
to run on waste vegetable oil and this

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.729 
to run on waste vegetable oil and this
year<00:00:37.930> we're<00:00:38.079> switching<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.469> biodiesel

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
year we're switching to biodiesel

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.099 
year we're switching to biodiesel
because<00:00:39.489> waste<00:00:40.149> vegetable<00:00:40.359> oil<00:00:40.539> has<00:00:40.809> actually

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
because waste vegetable oil has actually

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.689 
because waste vegetable oil has actually
become<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.379> pretty<00:00:41.530> valuable<00:00:42.039> commodity<00:00:42.519> and

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
become a pretty valuable commodity and

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.879 
become a pretty valuable commodity and
there<00:00:43.120> are<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.269> lot<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.469> small<00:00:44.469> start-up

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:44.889 
there are a lot of small start-up

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.559 
there are a lot of small start-up
companies<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.519> are<00:00:45.639> making<00:00:45.819> biodiesel<00:00:46.479> out

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
companies that are making biodiesel out

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:48.509 
companies that are making biodiesel out
of<00:00:46.749> waste<00:00:46.929> vegetable<00:00:47.139> oil<00:00:47.469> so<00:00:48.039> if<00:00:48.159> we<00:00:48.280> get<00:00:48.399> the

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
of waste vegetable oil so if we get the

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.770 
of waste vegetable oil so if we get the
waste<00:00:48.699> vegetable<00:00:48.909> oil<00:00:49.179> straight<00:00:49.569> from

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
waste vegetable oil straight from

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.329 
waste vegetable oil straight from
restaurants<00:00:50.350> then<00:00:50.739> we're<00:00:50.859> actually<00:00:50.920> taking

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
restaurants then we're actually taking

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.590 
restaurants then we're actually taking
it<00:00:51.429> away<00:00:51.519> from<00:00:51.639> companies<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.479> would

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
it away from companies that we would

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.930 
it away from companies that we would
really<00:00:52.780> like<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.019> support<00:00:53.229> so<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.460> are<00:00:54.729> going

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
really like to support so we are going

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
really like to support so we are going
to<00:00:54.999> be<00:00:55.089> buying<00:00:55.359> straight<00:00:55.690> from<00:00:55.839> those

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
to be buying straight from those

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.419 
to be buying straight from those
companies<00:00:56.289> in<00:00:56.559> order<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.859> support<00:00:57.159> them<00:00:57.280> in

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
companies in order to support them in

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.239 
companies in order to support them in
the<00:00:57.519> process<00:00:58.229> biodiesel<00:00:59.229> made<00:00:59.589> from<00:01:00.039> waste

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
the process biodiesel made from waste

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.669 
the process biodiesel made from waste
vegetable<00:01:00.519> oil<00:01:00.789> is<00:01:01.089> basically<00:01:01.719> just<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.530> oil

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
vegetable oil is basically just the oil

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.320 
vegetable oil is basically just the oil
with<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.010> glycerin<00:01:03.579> removed<00:01:03.879> it's<00:01:04.119> put

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
with the glycerin removed it's put

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.850 
with the glycerin removed it's put
through<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.540> chemical<00:01:04.900> process<00:01:05.379> called

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
through a chemical process called

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.250 
through a chemical process called
transesterification<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.869> makes<00:01:08.110> it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
transesterification which makes it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.620 
transesterification which makes it
basically<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.950> same<00:01:09.070> as<00:01:09.430> normal<00:01:10.210> diesel<00:01:10.540> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
basically the same as normal diesel you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.060 
basically the same as normal diesel you
can<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:10.930> put<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.230> right<00:01:11.260> into<00:01:11.530> any<00:01:11.770> diesel

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
can just put it right into any diesel

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.970 
can just put it right into any diesel
engine<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.700> will<00:01:12.820> run<00:01:13.000> just<00:01:13.180> fine<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.860> is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
engine and it will run just fine this is

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.740 
engine and it will run just fine this is
our<00:01:15.130> bus<00:01:15.370> ready<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.300> go<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:17.590> used<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.830> have<00:01:17.980> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
our bus ready to go we used to have a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.900 
our bus ready to go we used to have a
big<00:01:19.750> countertop<00:01:20.710> right<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:21.640> took

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
big countertop right here that we took

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.660 
big countertop right here that we took
out<00:01:22.240> because<00:01:22.600> we<00:01:22.780> wanted<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.080> little<00:01:23.200> bit<00:01:23.350> more

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
out because we wanted a little bit more

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.920 
out because we wanted a little bit more
flow<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.060> think<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.390> lot<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.570> people<00:01:25.870> are

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
flow so I think a lot of people are

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.810 
flow so I think a lot of people are
gonna<00:01:26.050> be<00:01:26.230> hanging<00:01:26.800> out<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:27.280> couch<00:01:27.520> just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
gonna be hanging out on this couch just

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.400 
gonna be hanging out on this couch just
because<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.450> biggest<00:01:28.630> open<00:01:29.200> space

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
because this is the biggest open space

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.950 
because this is the biggest open space
on<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.770> bus<00:01:30.010> by<00:01:30.700> far<00:01:30.910> this<00:01:31.360> used<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.930> a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
on the bus by far this used to be a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.320 
on the bus by far this used to be a
stove<00:01:32.350> but<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.010> was<00:01:33.130> never<00:01:33.550> connected<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.240> no

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
stove but it was never connected and no

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.870 
stove but it was never connected and no
one<00:01:34.420> ever<00:01:34.510> used<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.260> instead<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:35.800> all<00:01:36.760> right

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
one ever used it so instead we all right

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.330 
one ever used it so instead we all right
growing<00:01:37.240> some<00:01:37.420> mint<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.440> sink<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
growing some mint and this is a sink the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.580 
growing some mint and this is a sink the
water<00:01:42.580> tank<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.120> under<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> bus<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:44.440> can

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
water tank is under the bus and we can

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.710 
water tank is under the bus and we can
just<00:01:44.770> continue<00:01:45.250> refilling<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.790> back<00:01:46.480> here

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
just continue refilling it back here

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.770 
just continue refilling it back here
this<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.080> like<00:01:47.230> our<00:01:47.380> real<00:01:47.680> living<00:01:48.010> area<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:49.750> of
