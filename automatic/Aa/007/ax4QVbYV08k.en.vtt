00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello dear friends this is the third 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.390
 part in gta5 game optimization hope 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 final you like all the ways 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.080
 tried all the nerves spoiled but 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 there are a couple of unanswered questions 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.440
 who we will finish off today and in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 making them appear with your eyes 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.410
 the first thing I would like to say 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 thanks to users 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.180
 who are grateful to us guys 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 Thank you very much for your warm words of this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 really cool this urge to else 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.289
 better working is good mood a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 also if this is your first time watching this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 video sure to watch and first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.250
 part and second part many we helped and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.210
 We hope that we will help you and we will start with 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.780
 comments on overclocking video memory 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.480
 wrote that after overclocking the video memory 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 the problem disappeared with the hit of textures 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 do not be surprised that I have all the sliders 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.530
 off to factory maximum for me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.570
 video card series msi afterburner that is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 she is ready for it ok for it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 relate they go away in a hundred falls 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.729
 voltage in general users who 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.790
 overclock know something like that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 after ten minutes 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.870
 a valid game in which I have not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.480
 textures disappear lags begin 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.350
 moisture this is not freezing something not 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.380
 the cutters are 10 fps and even though you will burst 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.240
 you have 10 fps 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 I could do nothing with these in an hour 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.740
 two three 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.340
 i sat over it really all this 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 time tried it has BIOS settings and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.540
 monitor in all its indicators nothing in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.040
 in the end, I could not understand this because 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.730
 the video card is fully working on 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.510
 full maximum of the work process also with 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.430
 permissible fluctuations in the schedule 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.170
 RAM is stable but 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.970
 10 fps appear 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.990
 I do not know how this can be connected 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.760
 if you know the solution we will visit something 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 make comments in the comments 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.570
 if you have no problem then 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.840
 try 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.700
 but also if you are not involved in overclocking 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.770
 better not to try to either prepare like that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 say first read on forums like 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.140
 it's all done and then 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.650
 unscrew the sliders factory so 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 say limits but what about 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.690
 page file at 8 gigabytes 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.570
 RAM was the same 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.400
 remark that a person with such a volume 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.060
 reptile on the ball completely torments the file 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.130
 swap 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.650
 well , we also tried it 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.500
 pulled out the memory bar in 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.470
 it turned out that up to 30 minutes is 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.360
 really smooth games not a milling cutter outside 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.150
 a slowdown but after 30 minutes 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.310
 appear cutters with the disappearance of sound 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
 there is a game slows down 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.770
 and in time can dictate and say so 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.720
 good sound is lost 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.050
 it is much more disgusting than just 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.330
 lag and stick sound it really 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 horror i also tried to fix it 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.280
 in every possible way throughout 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.070
 2 hours here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.020
 but except to raise its file size 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.880
 swap 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.670
 nothing else has achieved the rest 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.390
 way so again you try 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.250
 build everything by yourself every computer 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
 he is individual and necessary for him 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.220
 individually set file parameters 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.530
 swap 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.320
 so how much factor does it affect this and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.000
 build windows and this and what a hard 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.960
 the disk there are many factors that 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.050
 will affect it further about the players 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.650
 which have four gigabytes of operational 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.100
 of memory 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.770
 guys do not try to disconnect the file 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.280
 swap because you will not meet the game 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:55.330
 and 5 seconds you got an error even when 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 loading the game is really weighty too 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.850
 can be seen by its installation file 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 and therefore and how much they occupy and 4 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.030
 gigabytes of ram and just not 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.780
 enough so these were all the questions 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.520
 which are not closed i think now we are all 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.720
 this is what we close finally here but 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.750
 Rostors pleased us with this news 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.930
 what will be the patch that will fix 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.240
 load with the central processor will be 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.420
 more loyally immerse texture 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.400
 in the distance that will subject to plunge 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.880
 texture well near 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.500
 here 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.900
 I think that this will be all , 4 then 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.180
 there is a patch in which all this 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.990
 promised at that time it was almost 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.880
 102 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:50.420
 what are all these problems now 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:55.190
 corrected almost 104 so we hope 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.400
 waiting for think for 34 and will appear free 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.060
 downloads this patch what rockstar 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.160
 finally 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.620
 change its policy in fix 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.580
 their mistakes and fix it all for 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.920
 once this was the final video 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.530
 since it makes no sense to shoot 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.010
 some new ways they are scanty them 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.890
 you can write your own on the forum 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.110
 here is a detachment already material after the release 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.410
 patch we tell it so to speak 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.790
 videos what came before what happened after 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.800
 it was all as clear as possible and 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.040
 users knew exactly what will happen after 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.410
 patch installation thanks a lot for 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.940
 attention watch video subscribe 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.610
