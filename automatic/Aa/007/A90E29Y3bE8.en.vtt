00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this of course this might make sense to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
this of course this might make sense to
some<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.789> may<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.059> confusing<00:01:03.600> to

trying to balance game play against

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.730 
trying to balance game play against
scale<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.330> interesting<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.110> huge<00:01:13.380> ocean

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
scale is interesting I can do huge ocean

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
scale is interesting I can do huge ocean
to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> huge<00:01:14.130> islands<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:14.700> easily<00:01:14.880> fast<00:01:15.299> now

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to the huge islands very easily fast now

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
to the huge islands very easily fast now
but<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> plays<00:01:16.350> bed<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> bigger<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but it plays bed but the bigger the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
but it plays bed but the bigger the
islands<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> big<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> biomes<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.229> be

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
islands are the big of the biomes can be

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.219 
islands are the big of the biomes can be
and<00:01:19.670> deserts<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.150> big<00:01:21.390> deep<00:01:21.750> oceans

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and deserts want to be big deep oceans

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
and deserts want to be big deep oceans
check<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:24.570> opinion<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.939> somewhat

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
check in my opinion this is somewhat

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.319 
check in my opinion this is somewhat
deep<00:01:27.150> water<00:01:27.450> extremely<00:01:28.110> deep<00:01:28.530> water<00:01:29.329> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
deep water extremely deep water and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.399 
deep water extremely deep water and
these<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.810> rivers<00:01:32.630> these<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.840> rivers

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
these are rivers these are all rivers

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.370 
these are rivers these are all rivers
and<00:01:35.150> these<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> different<00:01:36.600> islands<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and these are the different islands and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
and these are the different islands and
these<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> different<00:01:37.890> heights<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.970> each

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
these are the different heights on each

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
these are the different heights on each
island<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.740> thing<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:42.689> may<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.710> seem

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
island the thing is this may not seem

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
island the thing is this may not seem
exciting<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.180> people<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> could
