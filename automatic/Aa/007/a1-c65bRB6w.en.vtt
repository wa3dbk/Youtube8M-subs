a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.730> bigger<00:00:20.820> especially<00:00:21.300> because<00:00:21.449> sagen

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a little bigger especially because sagen

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.970 
a little bigger especially because sagen
is<00:00:22.490> getting<00:00:23.490> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> big<00:00:24.350> but<00:00:25.350> also<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.769> want

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
is getting kind of big but also we want

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.880 
is getting kind of big but also we want
to<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> sifting<00:00:27.000> litter<00:00:27.330> box<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
to get a sifting litter box because the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.299 
to get a sifting litter box because the
way<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> pellets<00:00:29.550> work<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.390> after<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.800> get

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
way the pellets work is after they get

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
way the pellets work is after they get
wet<00:00:32.520> after<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.120> urinate<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:34.230> kind

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
wet after they urinate on them they kind

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.319 
wet after they urinate on them they kind
of<00:00:34.559> turned<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.219> sawdust<00:00:35.760> type<00:00:36.030> stuff

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
of turned into like sawdust type stuff

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
of turned into like sawdust type stuff
so<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> sifting<00:00:37.680> litter<00:00:37.920> box<00:00:38.160> then

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so if we get a sifting litter box then

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
so if we get a sifting litter box then
we<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.879> lift<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.510> sifter<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.140> sift<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we can lift up the sifter and sift it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.420 
we can lift up the sifter and sift it
and<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.570> pee<00:00:42.890> molecule<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and all over the pee molecule to go to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
and all over the pee molecule to go to
the<00:00:44.579> bottom<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.059> clean<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.510> scoop

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the bottom we can clean that out scoop

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.479 
the bottom we can clean that out scoop
out<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.350> poop<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> becomes

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
out the poop at the top and it becomes

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.750 
out the poop at the top and it becomes
easy<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> clean<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.129> large

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
like you're good leather in the bottom

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
like you're good leather in the bottom
and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.110> reuse<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and then you can reuse it so it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.050 
and then you can reuse it so it's
basically<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> save<00:01:53.729> money<00:01:53.850> because

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
basically a way to save money because

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
basically a way to save money because
you<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.509> waste<00:01:54.720> glitter<00:01:55.189> we're<00:01:56.189> doing<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you don't waste glitter we're doing the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.109 
you don't waste glitter we're doing the
opposite<00:01:57.090> instead<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.960> trying<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
opposite instead of trying to put the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.520 
opposite instead of trying to put the
waste<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> top<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> good

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
waste at the top and put the good

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.959 
waste at the top and put the good
leather<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> bottom<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:02.610> trying<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
leather at the bottom we're trying to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.440 
leather at the bottom we're trying to
put<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> bad<00:02:03.540> litter<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> bottom<00:02:05.100> because

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
put the bad litter at the bottom because

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.580 
put the bad litter at the bottom because
the<00:02:06.450> bad<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.869> through<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.290> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the bad will go through because this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
the bad will go through because this
stuff<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> gets<00:02:08.670> wet<00:02:08.940> breaks<00:02:09.720> down<00:02:09.929> into

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
stuff when it gets wet breaks down into

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.229 
stuff when it gets wet breaks down into
sawdust<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.950> junk<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.640> want<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> go

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
sawdust like junk and we want that to go

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.290 
sawdust like junk and we want that to go
through<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
through and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.920 
through and
all<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.570> other<00:02:13.720> stuff<00:02:13.990> at<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.710> top<00:02:15.930> pretty

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
all the other stuff at the top pretty

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.350 
all the other stuff at the top pretty
cool<00:02:17.170> right<00:02:17.380> if<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> works<00:02:18.940> hopefully

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
cool right if it if it works hopefully

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.830 
cool right if it if it works hopefully
the<00:02:19.480> work<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:20.590> stuff<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.100> bigger<00:02:21.640> than<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the work this stuff is bigger than the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.640 
the work this stuff is bigger than the
little<00:02:23.050> holes<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.920> sifter<00:02:25.350> as<00:02:26.350> long<00:02:26.530> as

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
little holes for the sifter as long as

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.320 
little holes for the sifter as long as
they<00:02:26.770> don't<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.010> straight<00:02:27.250> through<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.180> what

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
they don't go straight through so what

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.030 
they don't go straight through so what
we're<00:02:28.450> hoping<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.990> that<00:02:29.050> when<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> cats<00:02:29.770> pee

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
we're hoping is that when the cats pee

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380 
we're hoping is that when the cats pee
we'll<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.370> able<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.610> shake<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> peel<00:02:31.270> will

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
we'll be able to shake it the peel will

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.580 
we'll be able to shake it the peel will
go<00:02:31.450> down<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> bottom<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.320> throw<00:02:32.500> away

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
go down to the bottom we can throw away

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.200 
go down to the bottom we can throw away
the<00:02:32.680> pee<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.190> then<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:33.940> scoop<00:02:34.120> out

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
the pee and then we can just scoop out

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.700 
the pee and then we can just scoop out
the<00:02:34.390> poop<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> top<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.200> that's<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.560> idea

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
the poop on the top so that's the idea

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.500 
the poop on the top so that's the idea
the<00:02:36.370> reason<00:02:36.520> we<00:02:36.700> want<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.940> use<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.150> pellets

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the reason we want to use these pellets

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.330 
the reason we want to use these pellets
I<00:02:37.780> explained<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> other<00:02:38.470> day<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.890> because<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
I explained the other day is because the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.340 
I explained the other day is because the
40<00:02:39.640> pound<00:02:39.820> bag<00:02:39.880> was<00:02:40.120> 5<00:02:40.390> bucks<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.170> is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
40 pound bag was 5 bucks and that is

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.570 
40 pound bag was 5 bucks and that is
crazy

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.680 
to see that and smell that so it should
work<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:27.610> should<00:03:27.790> work<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.330> they<00:03:28.450> just

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
work it should work and if they just

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.820 
work it should work and if they just
start<00:03:28.870> pooping<00:03:28.989> all<00:03:29.200> over<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.470> floor<00:03:29.650> then

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
start pooping all over the floor then

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.020 
start pooping all over the floor then
I'll<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.100> tear<00:03:30.280> up<00:03:30.340> my<00:03:30.400> hair<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.730> don't<00:03:30.820> know

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
I'll just tear up my hair I don't know

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.150 
I'll just tear up my hair I don't know
but<00:03:31.480> I'm<00:03:31.900> hoping<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.350> will<00:03:32.650> work<00:03:32.830> let's<00:03:33.040> give

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
but I'm hoping this will work let's give

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.340 
but I'm hoping this will work let's give
it<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.310> few<00:03:33.430> hours<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.820> see<00:03:33.880> what<00:03:34.090> happens<00:03:34.480> yes

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
it a few hours and see what happens yes

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.780 
it a few hours and see what happens yes
it<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:35.709> has<00:03:35.890> been<00:03:36.130> eight<00:03:36.250> hours<00:03:36.400> later

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
it really has been eight hours later

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.160 
it really has been eight hours later
we've<00:03:37.510> stayed<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.080> late<00:03:38.620> tonight<00:03:39.750> they<00:03:40.750> used

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
we've stayed up late tonight they used

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.100 
we've stayed up late tonight they used
it<00:03:41.650> someone<00:03:42.250> used<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.670> because<00:03:43.030> there<00:03:43.630> was<00:03:43.660> pee

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
it someone used it because there was pee

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.070 
it someone used it because there was pee
although<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.680> didn't<00:03:44.980> see<00:03:45.160> any<00:03:45.430> pee<00:03:45.670> all<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.630> saw

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
although I didn't see any pee all I saw

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.050 
although I didn't see any pee all I saw
was<00:03:47.440> some<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.190> pellets<00:03:48.580> had<00:03:48.820> been

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
was some of the pellets had been

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.630 
was some of the pellets had been
disintegrated<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.200> also<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.800> bottom<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
disintegrated and also the bottom of the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.550 
disintegrated and also the bottom of the
thing<00:03:51.880> was<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.450> damp<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:55.090> works<00:03:55.360> sort<00:03:56.350> of

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
thing was a little damp it works sort of

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.390 
thing was a little damp it works sort of
here's<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> ears<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.489> issue<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.470> saw

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
here's the ears of the issue and I saw

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.180 
here's the ears of the issue and I saw
this<00:04:00.580> in<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> store<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:03.040> should

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
this in the store and I really should

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.449 
this in the store and I really should
have<00:04:03.520> said<00:04:03.910> something<00:04:04.060> done<00:04:04.920> let<00:04:05.920> me<00:04:05.950> scrape

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
have said something done let me scrape

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.229 
have said something done let me scrape
through<00:04:06.670> here<00:04:07.350> do<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.500> see<00:04:08.530> how<00:04:09.040> big<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
through here do you see how big the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.720 
through here do you see how big the
holes<00:04:10.480> are<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.380> problem<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.280> pellets

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
holes are the problem is these pellets

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.710 
holes are the problem is these pellets
fall<00:04:13.060> through<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:15.250> kind<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.030> an<00:04:16.180> issue<00:04:16.359> I

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
fall through that's kind of an issue I

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.180 
fall through that's kind of an issue I
mean<00:04:16.900> they<00:04:17.019> fall<00:04:17.470> through<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.830> they're<00:04:18.010> like

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
mean they fall through if they're like

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.620 
mean they fall through if they're like
this<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.730> they're<00:04:18.880> laying<00:04:19.060> like<00:04:19.269> this<00:04:19.299> they

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
this if they're laying like this they

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.510 
this if they're laying like this they
won't<00:04:19.810> because<00:04:20.230> they're<00:04:20.560> too<00:04:21.130> big<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.460> that

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
won't because they're too big for that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.450 
won't because they're too big for that
but<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.060> actually<00:04:22.450> needs<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.780> be<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.430> finer<00:04:25.080> mess

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
but it actually needs to be a finer mess

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.720 
but it actually needs to be a finer mess
because<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.510> problem<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.410> go<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.190> sift<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
because the problem is I go to sift it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.570 
because the problem is I go to sift it
and<00:04:29.790> shake<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.889> P<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.220> falling

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and shake it and the P is falling

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.150 
and shake it and the P is falling
through<00:04:32.790> yes<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.660> if<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.930> P<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.320> top<00:04:34.590> which

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
through yes but if the P is on top which

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.940 
through yes but if the P is on top which
is<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.669> its<00:04:35.790> gonna<00:04:35.850> be<00:04:36.200> though<00:04:37.200> you're<00:04:37.889> gonna

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
is what its gonna be though you're gonna

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.040 
is what its gonna be though you're gonna
lose<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.220> ton<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.580> pellets<00:04:39.120> falling<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.930> there

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
lose a ton of pellets falling in there

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.780 
lose a ton of pellets falling in there
too<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:42.139> not<00:04:43.139> really<00:04:43.410> sure<00:04:43.650> what<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.250> do<00:04:44.490> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
too so not really sure what to do I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.150 
too so not really sure what to do I
think<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:46.110> wanted<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.470> keep<00:04:46.620> using<00:04:46.919> this

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
think if we wanted to keep using this

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.460 
think if we wanted to keep using this
method<00:04:47.580> what<00:04:47.880> we<00:04:47.910> need<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.300> do<00:04:48.450> is<00:04:48.660> somehow

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
method what we need to do is somehow

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.450 
method what we need to do is somehow
alter<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.760> sifting<00:04:51.330> tray<00:04:51.690> itself<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:53.310> be

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
alter the sifting tray itself to be

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.930 
alter the sifting tray itself to be
finer

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
finer

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.290 
finer
so<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.419> pail<00:04:54.600> itself<00:04:54.930> fall<00:04:55.110> through<00:04:56.300> don't

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
so the pail itself fall through don't

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.080 
so the pail itself fall through don't
really<00:04:57.540> know<00:04:57.720> how<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.919> do<00:04:59.160> that

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
really know how to do that

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.110 
really know how to do that
I<00:05:00.120> think<00:05:00.690> they<00:05:00.840> sell<00:05:01.200> like<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.130> mesh<00:05:02.460> liner<00:05:02.790> so

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
I think they sell like the mesh liner so

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.030 
I think they sell like the mesh liner so
you<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.270> do<00:05:03.450> sifting<00:05:03.870> with<00:05:03.990> anything<00:05:04.470> or<00:05:04.680> like

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
you can do sifting with anything or like

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.340 
you can do sifting with anything or like
just<00:05:05.070> pick<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.550> up<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.480> leather<00:05:06.810> falls<00:05:07.140> in

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
just pick it up and the leather falls in

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.520 
just pick it up and the leather falls in
and<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.740> have<00:05:07.950> like<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.160> little<00:05:08.460> bag<00:05:08.610> of<00:05:08.640> poop

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
and you have like a little bag of poop

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.110 
and you have like a little bag of poop
so<00:05:10.530> maybe<00:05:10.740> we'll<00:05:10.890> do<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.669> just<00:05:11.910> it's

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
so maybe we'll do that it just it's

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.630 
so maybe we'll do that it just it's
gonna<00:05:12.240> have<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.450> be<00:05:12.510> fine<00:05:12.840> because<00:05:13.080> we<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.340> has

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
gonna have to be fine because we it has

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.400 
gonna have to be fine because we it has
to<00:05:14.820> let<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.090> solidus<00:05:15.360> stuff<00:05:15.750> fall<00:05:16.200> through

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
to let the solidus stuff fall through

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.020 
to let the solidus stuff fall through
but<00:05:16.590> keep<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.890> pellets<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.340> there<00:05:17.520> but

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
but keep the pellets in there but

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.930 
but keep the pellets in there but
someone<00:05:18.570> peed<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:20.400> know<00:05:20.490> probably

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
someone peed in it you know probably
