whatever it was that I found because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.760 
whatever it was that I found because
then<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.170> would<00:01:24.380> not<00:01:24.500> just<00:01:24.770> feel<00:01:26.049> overly<00:01:27.049> full<00:01:27.380> I

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
then I would not just feel overly full I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.770 
then I would not just feel overly full I
would<00:01:28.159> also<00:01:28.280> feel<00:01:28.610> bad<00:01:28.640> about<00:01:28.940> myself<00:01:29.180> for

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
would also feel bad about myself for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.070 
would also feel bad about myself for
falling<00:01:30.049> off<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.440> wagon<00:01:30.530> not<00:01:30.979> eating<00:01:31.280> healthy

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
falling off the wagon not eating healthy

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.930 
falling off the wagon not eating healthy
and<00:01:33.080> sometimes<00:01:33.530> if<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.369> have<00:01:34.460> too<00:01:34.580> much<00:01:34.700> sugar

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
and sometimes if I have too much sugar

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.210 
and sometimes if I have too much sugar
it<00:01:35.119> makes<00:01:35.180> me<00:01:35.630> feel<00:01:35.869> jittery<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.560> weird<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.190> I

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
it makes me feel jittery and weird so I

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.710 
it makes me feel jittery and weird so I
would<00:01:37.549> just<00:01:37.670> feel<00:01:37.850> worse<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:38.659> many

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
would just feel worse on so many

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.870 
would just feel worse on so many
different<00:01:38.960> levels<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.280> for<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.760> most

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
different levels and now for the most

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.030 
different levels and now for the most
part<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.390> make<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> conscious<00:01:42.260> decision<00:01:43.010> to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
part I make the conscious decision to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.690
