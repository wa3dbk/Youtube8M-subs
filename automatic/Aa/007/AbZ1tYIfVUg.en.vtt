00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.130
 hello friends welcome again to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.770
 doctor's tips maqueda 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.990
 we know how important it is to make 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.920
 certain handling to the piglet at the time of 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.720
 born as it is first cleanse the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.400
 Snout so you can breathe 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.780
 then tie cut and disinfect 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.300
 navel after finishing cleaning it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.570
 Kiss him and write down the weight in the register 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.070
 and then cut off the tail and disinfect 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.010
 the cutting surface 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.950
 excellent but and how do we sustain the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 injury as we grab it to be able to 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.110
 do this work efficiently 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.410
 just that is what we will see in this 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.410
 kind 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.530
 and try to do it between the legs 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.690
 to have both hands free is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 uncomfortable 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.530
 and also the work clothes get dirty 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.410
 a lot and we can also be transmitters 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 of germs to be contaminated 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.010
 [Music] 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.800
 hold it with one hand or arm 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.680
 only in addition to uncomfortable is 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.560
 dangerous as it can fall and as the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.960
 Sucker is wet and slippery what 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.510
 we press hard so that we do not get 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.510
 fall preventing breathing 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.270
 and doing it between two people requires 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.920
 more personal then a practical way 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 is to hang it as 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.840
 with the help of a piece of cable or rope 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.910
 of plastic that can be decided to be 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.180
 easily and a pin first the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.900
 we folded it in half and what 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.900
 we introduce 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.460
 on the plug to the cable 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.460
 we tie a knot 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.820
 and now it's ready to put the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.650
 sucker here as we fix it to the cage 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.879
 in this way 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.879
 it happens like that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.670
 and now it's held then here 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.709
 we can put the piglet let's see how 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:59.400
 we introduced a sucker feet 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.680
 front and the unstable head and 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.840
 we press a little down the plug 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.030
 in this way the piglet is sustained 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.730
 does not squeeze his lungs the game 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.530
 breathe freely and even 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.709
 scream and is part of our goal 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 if we have both hands free 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:28.309
 to work with him 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:28.309
 [Music] 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.240
 lives in secant dust for animals and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.120
 livestock facilities is a dust 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.790
 beige color of a very granulometry 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.670
 fine that gives it a high capacity 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.670
 of absorption and immediate retention of 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.700
 liquids and organic matter does not 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.500
 waste and it's very safe it applies 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.530
 directly on the skin of the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
 animals and also on the floor and bed 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.110
 It is recommended during the reception of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.030
 neonatal animals at the time of birth 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.540
 should be applied directly on the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.880
 scattered skin sprinkled or you can 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.730
 Immerse the animals in a deposit 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.760
 that contains life favors the fast 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.489
 umbilical cord drying and accelerates the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.520
 scarring reducing the risk of 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.390
 diseases with life sec a good start 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.140
 for a better future if it's bayern is 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.909
 good 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.129
 [Music] 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:34.500
 can also hang on the scale and 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.090
 so we will have a weight at the same time 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.720
 to write it down in the registry 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.660
 [Music] 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.000
 with this type of attachment we are 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.770
 facilitate the work we can have several 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 or one and change it from a cage to 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.680
 another for the sow that will now give birth 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.249
 having disinfected the attachment 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.769
 between one and the other 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.899
 there are also those who prefer to hang them in 

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:05.149
 the hind legs of the snout towards 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:07.839
 down to help the phlegm of 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:12.369
 the little ones go out is also correct 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.369
 let's see it again in slow motion 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.080
 perfect and so we have both hands 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.110
 free 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.650
 ingenuity and creativity too 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:29.419
 help look at this case it was built 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.490
 a mobile attachment with wheels this 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.490
 has even an attachment for 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.120
 hang the scissors with a jar with 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.580
 disinfectant and it's pvc in this other 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.319
 case also has a space for 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.840
 place the piglets while 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.700
 they take care with a rubber mat that 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.180
 disinfects constantly 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.140
 and we can see the worker with his clothes 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.150
 very clean 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.600
 tending to piglets with high 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.600
 efficiency to provide the worker 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.780
 the execution of its functions will 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.990
 obviously in greater efficiency this what 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.020
 means healthy piglets with energy 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:14.460
 sucking colostrum immediately in summary 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:18.830
 a correct start friends thank you very much 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.830
 and see you in the next time 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.270
