00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.350
 hello and welcome to a new evolution 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.629
 of your android channel evolution affection 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.790
 friend Luis out 97 and in this video I come 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.860
 to show you how to eliminate 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.900
 applications that come with your operator 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.090
 or that they are simply applications that 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.890
 they do not stop installing like for example 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.570
 is the case of some widgets that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 we install and at the moment of wanting 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.920
 uninstall them with our 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.779
 uninstaller that comes by factory in 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.029
 what is android just do not 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.010
 can you stay there some files and 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.960
 others and good we will do this with a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.270
 application once I inform you that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 we need to be root users and you 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.410
 I say that if you're not root yet I do not know what 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.230
 you wait as good with the root you'll be 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.180
 obtaining much greater benefits 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.100
 users who are not root and good 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.100
 start this application because they 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.170
 I'll leave the link to download it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.210
 directly from the lent his name is 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 titanium backup which is an application 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.899
 that as I say 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.510
 requires root and also does not weigh anything 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.890
 is a fairly light application and that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.030
 offers you a lot of functions since 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.310
 it also offers you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.600
 so you can backup as the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.900
 name but in this case we see 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.330
 show them how you can install those 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.310
 applications we already entered and they have good 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.409
 to give accept and others because as is 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 the first time you start it 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.000
 they will have to give superuser permissions 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.850
 and then once this is done we will give 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 here on the menu touch button and we're going to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.649
 give it here where it says batch tasks in 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.899
 batch tasks a list appears 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.790
 of many options in which we will have 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.799
 to go all the way down and in the box 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.450
 uninstall we have to give where it says 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.580
 uninstall all applications 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.380
 user the system is tells you that a lot 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.140
 be careful but the truth does not matter here 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.570
 we enter and therefore avoid risks 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 we will have to give in to select all 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.679
 because if for example we send to give 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.300
 do it then uninstall all the 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.950
 applications and go to error that 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.600
 we would have in our in our 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 device so good of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.920
 we select everything to avoid 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.440
 risks now we are going to look for the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.290
 application in my case as I have a 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.690
 custom rom, I do not have applications for 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 the operator or something like that but well 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190
 I have an application that I do not use for 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.380
 nothing that is the sweep keyboard this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.180
 keyboard because I do not really use it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.220
 for nothing so I'm going to put it as 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.740
 example then it's all from 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.090
 selected simply we will click on 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.980
 the one that says in the application that 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.530
 I want, I recommend you do it 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.440
 one by one because they have several 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.840
 at the same time your device may have 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.090
 a lac and get stuck then 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 they would have to turn it off to remove the lid 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 battery and so on so good 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
 let's do it one by one 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.190
 in this way we will avoid all this 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.840
 kind of problems with the application a 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.459
 Once done this we simply select 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.720
 and we are going to give up here in the option 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.850
 who says do it 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.830
 in this way start to uninstall the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.630
 application may be late or may it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.130
 not depending on the size of the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.910
 application that we are uninstalling 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.709
 you will have to reactivate the permits 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.280
 of superuser every time we do 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.620
 this uninstall an application 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.630
 but here already it tells us that so impacted 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.310
 will be granted the permits of 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.720
 superuser and now it could well 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.340
 end here in the bar 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.950
 notifications a message appears 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.770
 that says titanium backup homework 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 uninstallation finished and simply 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.030
 it's nothing, we will not have to open 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.550
 the mined now if it has already been 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.550
 completely uninstalled this application 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.200
 of our device to good avoid 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.890
 errors regarding those applications 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.810
 that may have been running 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.550
 that we already want to install is recommended 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.920
 restart it in this way then 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.620
 we will avoid any kind of problem 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.650
 with our device since then 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.780
 it was deleted and we will have to restart it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.269
 so that in case you have stayed 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.920
 activated this task the finalize and of 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.810
 this way could be in modes 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.489
 freeing us from that application that does not 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.980
 we wanted to have in our device 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.690
 either from the operator or some 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.580
 application that was not allowed to uninstall 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.050
