00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Where did you put my glasses? 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.400
 Two years ago I made a video on Facebook 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.960
 It changed. Today I will talk about Facebook. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.920
 I decided to do some updating 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.080
 Because Facebook has changed since then. 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.160
 Now we can press "I love" everything we want. 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.200
 This was not possible before, and this caused very strange practices. 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 You know ... people who make a comment that they admire their own publications .. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.880
 They comment on this comment 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.240
 And ... they are impressed by this comment. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.080
 You have seen people like them. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320
 Why it works !! .. I do not know 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.640
 Perhaps because their memory is weak .. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.560
 "It was a great evening yesterday!" 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.600
 "Oh! It's a publication! I'm a fan" 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.160
 "Oh! 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.040
 "You're obviously right!" 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.920
 "Oh! Comment!" 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.420
 'Impress' 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.000
 Oh! 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.840
 Another mysterious thing about Facebook 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 The people who place their profession are the place of their names 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 Of type .. "Kevin Bolat photographer" 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.840
 They are often photographers 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520
 Someone must explain to me the feasibility of doing that one day .. 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.880
 Soon .. What will they put? 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.400
 "Jean-Baptiste Benioff, maintenance agent of production units." 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.360
 Production units .. It's my passion! 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.040
 Not to mention the category that places the status of "official" as part of their names .. 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.200
 What does this mean.. ? Does this mean that there are "official" 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.480
 Others are not "official" 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 Or is there a group of copies who present themselves as they? .. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.980
 I do not know 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.280
 "Good morning, I'm Kevin Bowley, we're honored" 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.000
 "Everything is perfect" 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.160
 "I'm the Kevin Poly formal, Dear Challengers" 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.800
 "Curse" 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
 "He discovered me" 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 There is something else that bothers me about Facebook 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.800
 They're people who change their cheap photos several times a week 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 Not to put a new picture, no 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.760
 But only for change 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.880
 They put that front 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.400
 Then, those that follow 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.900
 Then, those that are before the first 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.600
 So, to change 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 I just want to ask people who do it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 Why ? 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 Ah yes ! Because they are children .... 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.680
 No ... no no no no 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 Uh ! Or because they ... 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 No, no no, it's ... 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 I do not see what makes sense in that 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 Well, good side! 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 Is that almost everyone is on facebook today .. 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 This is very practical 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.320
 In the business world for example 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.040
 - Cyprian, you must give the file to Julian Pichon 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 Yes! Julian Pichon 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.840
 - Yes, of course! Julian Pichon! I have ten years in this institution 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120
 I know who he is 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.880
 I know his name, of course 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 So it can save your life a bit 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.600
 - Hi Ciprian, Anis Bovi from accounting .. Want to drink with you a cup tonight 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.880
 - Anis Bowie? 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.040
 - No, no no I'm sick of this, sorry 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
 - I ... I .. Yes ... I do not feel so well .. I ... 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 - I think he was a man ... 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
 - I told him, "Morning charity Sir" in the morning .. 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 In the end .. There are not only the pros that everyone on facebook .. 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 My mother is on Facebook 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.540
 Worst! 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.120
 My grandmother is on Facebook 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.240
 Worst! 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320
 My grandmother attached to my postings 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.440
 Here !! I said no! 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.400
 This is not possible 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.520
 I can not pass this on 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.280
 I took the problem seriously 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040
 My grandmother! What is happening to you now? Stop it right away! 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 Would it make me happy to come to your comment when they change your diapers? 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 Well .. it's the same! 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.020
 Stop! 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.920
 Otherwise I will come to the nursing home 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.560
 And I separate you ("about the Internet") 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.740
 Ah but I do not care! 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.720
 Feel free to share my video on Facebook and join my page 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.200
 And go to Cyprien.fr to see all my videos 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.760
 Juggler! Translated by stream2 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 Curse!
