00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.170
 and burns all guys I'm crucial 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 for me as always there is my hotel 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 vinsanity and we are here today 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 proud to introduce myself for the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.830
 first time one of our videos on this one 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 fantastic community from how I enjoy it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.100
 always video will be accepted but a 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.600
 part inconvenience flights 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 I take this opportunity to introduce ourselves to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 because most of you indeed 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.119
 we say that none of you will know us 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.500
 surely oh well these are 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.210
 special, however we are two brothers 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 that we make videos on youtube from October 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 almost two years ago and our i 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 our gameplay is focused 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 more on call of duty though 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.030
 occasionally we also change to call of duty 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 however you have understood 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.730
 in short, what we treat e 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 let's go straight to the actual video 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 what you are seeing is one that mps a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.399
 I do not remember the map taking 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.620
 where this game took me 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 really so much is ok anyway 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 jokes and I wanted to clarify 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.350
 right away, the video as you have 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.629
 got to see it really lasts 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 it hardly lasts about 4 minutes so I don't 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.979
 it does not even take so long 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.860
 your life to watch it even if the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.130
 message it contains is really a lot 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.680
 strong if we could so intend 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.479
 of the gaming community anyway 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.039
 in most cases when you 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.140
 presents us in the communities 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.869
 they try to get the attention of the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.030
 subscribers say no maybe trying to 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.460
 propose some absurd gameplay not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.100
 I know who can triple such death 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.229
 instead we propose a miserable kehm 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.750
 yes because this is our potential 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.179
 but let's say we will try to bet 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 more on commentary than on 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.060
 on the gameplay 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.860
 ok now I would like to ask you a question that a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.149
 many of you may seem trivial 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.890
 method others part of the reading parts 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.720
 salvation to clean up the ass 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.729
 the question is quite simple him 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 I would like to ask what is the reason why 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.659
 play that now there are several reasons 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.330
 of course someone could 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.810
 sit down and start playing these 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.220
 2d games in our say with 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.899
 recklessness in most cases 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.009
 it is the big money 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.950
 in fact many begin to play 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.319
 just to earn others could 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.849
 play most others in and 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.799
 I still hope people play 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.390
 they do it for pure fun for 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.150
 spend some time but let's start in 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.239
 I do n't know anyone's company 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.799
 also be business reasons why not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.299
 however in contemporary times now 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.549
 we see that many are developing 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.109
 and several jobs that maybe 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.620
 previously we didn't even imagine 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.109
 but the reason why we play at 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.970
 what we have in common is that of 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.970
 have fun going through let's say 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.290
 the half hour or the straight one 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.480
 it is so 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 to give as damned maybe 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.890
 together with some friends and have fun 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.879
 but in the end what is true 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.159
 fun 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.510
 whether it is a net superiority in the 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.730
 I'm not against others 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.430
 referring to the skill but something more 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.409
 of greater than the skin that however 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.349
 now to mine of the living to be noticed 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.329
 let us hope that in short the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.040
 video you enjoyed if it is so left 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.980
 of travel a comment and I think again from 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.019
 this question what is the reason why 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.019
 sat there and played
