00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 The ministers can become a new majority of the company's own shares 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.980
 it is not even that much 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
 for FC Twente and Arsenal usually the day 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.830
 the ten year old son 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.830
 that has his brother meet 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 in addition, the chances were champions 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 liederkerke 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.630
 the umpteenth pointless thing that I am here 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 in the dressing room 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430
 the students and comes black in advance 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 so that is also true 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.650
 we don't need much 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.990
 I will give you 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.160
 remarkable career itself too 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.360
 mediocre career as a role 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.810
 something big like that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.400
 successes 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400
 but whoever year 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.570
 that people like that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 according to him 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 scene set 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 and with that FC Twente Sint Willebrord 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.699
 that delivered and standard stays outside for a while 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.709
 and they consumption 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 kees of miracles 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.899
 finally want to play football 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.409
 being become 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.119
 You are capable of driver tablets 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.829
 I've got it here in Breda, of course that isn't 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.939
 and you see that as care assistants 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 and sit there 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.059
 there is only the question 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.059
 but you don't want to do that 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.679
 he has already warned 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.789
 but Jan Joost wanted to change his spill bowl 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.839
 He said that with a radiant we will see crime 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:33.839
 yes it is great to ever have such a salary 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.719
 he expects 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.059
 cheeky 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.359
 it's been a long time 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.279
 hereafter is near this type 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.549
 the debts of spain 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.610
 a the people who are all thinking club twente and nac on the people don't 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.589
 great for further interrogation 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.150
 Jaap a deserved keeper, you should have waited 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.099
 Volkskrant Tuesday is below 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.079
 8 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.049
 no I did not have it I did not expect that he is not expecting but is alone 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.539
 but nice dark hammer 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.709
 the other the governor yes that is of course not what everyone says the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.369
 consistency, but it is much more than this group of council seats and 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:14.659
 shares a very scary own really really a team and make some really good 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.659
 football off 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.219
 and can count after his loss 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.120
 whatever 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.329
 I say I thought up 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.329
 the independent less 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.650
 they said do that 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.870
 about myself adha both men's medal is correct 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.759
 as the Netherlands 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.759
 he fears it was sooner 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.499
 the slowaken 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 so became the dollars 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.189
 upon returning home 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.689
 respond 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:11.370
 don't fall for it 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.719
 how do we go through the dressing room 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.139
 then you deserve to have a bag 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.259
 because of the camera 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.259
 compromise 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.919
 it's about time 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.830
 criticism from the international co-prosecutor
