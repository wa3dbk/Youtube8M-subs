00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
your home screen and I can see as you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.650 
your home screen and I can see as you
can<00:02:30.060> see<00:02:30.209> i<00:02:30.240> have<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.480> HTC<00:02:31.010> type<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.940> clock<00:02:33.420> down

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
can see i have a HTC type on clock down

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
can see i have a HTC type on clock down
on<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:33.990> first<00:02:34.230> page<00:02:34.790> also<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:37.500> background<00:02:38.250> it's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
on my first page also in background it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160 
on my first page also in background it's
a<00:02:38.490> great<00:02:38.700> app<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.690> run<00:02:39.959> multiple

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
a great app because you can run multiple

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.690 
a great app because you can run multiple
applications<00:02:41.600> at<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.840> time<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.830> another<00:02:44.310> tweak

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
applications at a time but another tweak

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.270 
applications at a time but another tweak
that<00:02:44.880> goes<00:02:45.420> perfect<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.200> background<00:02:46.830> is

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that goes perfect with background is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.120 
that goes perfect with background is
called<00:02:47.580> proswitcher<00:02:47.880> or<00:02:48.540> multiflow<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.590> think

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
called proswitcher or multiflow I think

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
called proswitcher or multiflow I think
multiflow<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> paid<00:02:51.000> app<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:51.630> pro<00:02:51.959> switch

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
multiflow is a paid app but pro switch

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.590 
multiflow is a paid app but pro switch
is<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.580> access<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.209> at

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
is not and you can access it at

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.830 
is not and you can access it at
different<00:02:54.780> ways<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.410> from<00:02:56.370> your<00:02:56.550> own<00:02:56.840> status

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
different ways like from your own status

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.990 
different ways like from your own status
