00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 very good kids here we are not 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.370
 all videos I bring a pretty gray 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.170
 fun in gta 5 online to troll to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 all your friends are going to make a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.210
 god mode in full rule are you going to be in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.830
 the creator mode of maps in gta 5 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.150
 online and at the same time in a game 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.740
 ahead as you can see I am in a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.789
 heading ahead you want that is degrees the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 program that is in the description 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 obviously to do all these steps 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 perfectly and when we are already with 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.869
 the program triggered and give us a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 the little to give us a little 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.990
 also time and give me margin 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.580
 We give money and services that we give to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.349
 the X and when we give the X 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 we have to give the start now what 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.950
 I will pass all this slow motion as you see 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 we give the x to be every time we go 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.879
 go to the playstation store when we are in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.120
 playstation store quietly we go to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.879
 give ax so and again we will 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 go to the starter start we go online and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 let's go to the beta creator there 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.250
 we have to give so we go we get into 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.750
 the beta creator without any problem I 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 here I get confused as you see gives us 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.469
 quite a margin in the people that the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 program that goes up although you have in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 the description as you see we get into 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 the beta creator and we give him yes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 now we would have this when we are 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.250
 within the beta creator that will now happen 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.450
 all this you have all the steps in the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.219
 description bothers me 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.649
 enroll it because I know it's complicated 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.090
 and then when we are here we go to 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.700
 deactivate the program 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.649
 as we go to what the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 creator as you see this loads very slow 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.740
 I'm going to leave it because it's a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500
 nonsense remove it and sometimes I jump 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.549
 happens if it is a dumb as you see here no 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 there is nothing available at this time 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.000
 visit us later I do not know what we 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.409
 we go back without any problem 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 as you see we are going backwards we are 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.780
 again in the rockstar cloud and already 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 we will be in the creator and at the same time in the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 heading forward we go to a game 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.209
 death to create it and we're already here 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.770
 we are already directly in the game 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.209
 ahead to the death creator and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 As you can see, I'm here with my character 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.380
 there are no cars, there is nothing, there are only people 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.060
 that people have to look 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 obviously if you are your friends then 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 You can speak for them on Skype because 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.429
 out there on the skin there is not 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.039
 I would find some you will not listen to them like 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.450
 you do not see the map or anything and something else 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.739
 very good that you can teleport 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.599
 to any place as you see framework in the 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.920
 site map of the clover and I'm leaving 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.020
 directly where the clover if you have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 used the creator as this you can 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.470
 do without any problem obviously and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.910
 I say medium band teleport another 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.440
 time to the house from before where we are 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.920
 before the house of four hundred thousand 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.840
 Dollars 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.550
 I found out it transported again here 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 I will be with our friends in the online 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.599
 with their cars obviously because as 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.580
 you see there's no traffic here I stole a 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.230
 car to a guiri it seems to steal 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
 a stop and if I tell a friend of mine that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 come to the house as you see is here in 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.959
 I see the house without any problem what 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.049
 What happens is that he will sell me the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.730
 I gao and I am totally invisible I am the 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.500
 Lord Jesus, how are you seeing here? 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.209
 It kills anybody or explode me things 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.160
 now I say flame of all strip me 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.170
 grenades strip deserves 4 what you want to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.239
 see if something happens and as you can see it is a car 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
 normal that stolen a person because 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.590
 there is no car around and as you see 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.120
 as I am inside it does not explode it does not happen 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.660
 nothing are exploding all the grenades 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 out there my car or god are you without 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.930
 no problem and it does not explode like 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.180
 would happen with a normal car like I am 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.040
 seeing and good and being here you can 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.720
 kill anyone by running over 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.879
 obviously because you do not have weapons or 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.190
 nothing you can put ramps or any 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.140
 thing you want me here I killed a couple 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.709
 of people I do not know who it was if it was micro 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.410
