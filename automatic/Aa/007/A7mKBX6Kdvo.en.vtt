00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
a comparison of course there's a little

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.670 
a comparison of course there's a little
bit<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.209> fading<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.050> since<00:02:13.200> white<00:02:13.410> stuff

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
bit of fading just since white stuff

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.490 
bit of fading just since white stuff
will<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.099> anyway

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
will do that anyway

well<00:02:36.220> let's<00:02:37.000> talk<00:02:37.120> about<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.390> functionality

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
well let's talk about the functionality

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.930 
well let's talk about the functionality
of<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.170> case<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.830> works<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.550> apples

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
of the case it works just like apples

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.340 
of the case it works just like apples
Smart<00:02:40.120> Cover<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.690> have<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> magnetic

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
Smart Cover you have the magnetic

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.500 
Smart Cover you have the magnetic
sleepweight<00:02:41.860> cover<00:02:42.190> right<00:02:42.459> here<00:02:42.760> which<00:02:43.270> works

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
sleepweight cover right here which works

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.690 
sleepweight cover right here which works
great<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.530> case<00:02:44.740> also<00:02:44.950> folds<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:45.490> two

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
great the case also folds into two

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.430 
great the case also folds into two
different<00:02:45.880> viewing<00:02:46.270> angles<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.959> first<00:02:47.200> angle
