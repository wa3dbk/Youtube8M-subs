the<00:00:21.570> starting<00:00:21.869> at<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> Battle<00:00:22.290> see<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.650> have

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the starting at the Battle see how have

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
the starting at the Battle see how have
the<00:00:22.980> rocket<00:00:23.340> launcher<00:00:23.810> we're<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the rocket launcher we're going to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.189 
the rocket launcher we're going to
destroy<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.279> crystals<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.109> sides<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
destroy the crystals on the sides of the

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.070 
destroy the crystals on the sides of the
of<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.470> arena<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:36.090> reason<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
of this arena and the reason for that is

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.930 
of this arena and the reason for that is
that<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.440> crystals<00:00:37.860> supply<00:00:38.160> him<00:00:38.400> with<00:00:38.430> those

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that the crystals supply him with those

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
that the crystals supply him with those
floating<00:00:39.420> orbs<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.960> I'll<00:00:40.080> tell<00:00:40.199> you<00:00:40.290> what

floating orbs and I'll tell you what

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.320 
floating orbs and I'll tell you what
they<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> second<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:43.400> he<00:00:44.400> has<00:00:44.850> some

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
they do here in a second but he has some

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.289 
they do here in a second but he has some
crazy<00:00:45.960> powerful<00:00:46.799> attacks<00:00:47.159> and<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.549> you<00:00:47.729> get

so yeah we take we took it all the
crystals<00:00:57.000> without<00:00:57.330> dying<00:00:58.199> epically<00:00:58.830> now

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
crystals without dying epically now

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
crystals without dying epically now
we're<00:00:59.610> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> unload<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> rest<00:01:00.299> of<00:01:00.479> our

into<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> three<00:01:05.159> different<00:01:05.549> rooms<00:01:06.000> here

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
into one of three different rooms here

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.250 
into one of three different rooms here
in<00:01:06.750> sequence<00:01:07.940> now<00:01:08.940> i'm<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> edit<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.960> me

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
in sequence now i'm going to edit out me
escaping<00:01:10.950> these<00:01:11.220> rooms<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.090> just

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
escaping these rooms because that just

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
escaping these rooms because that just
takes<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.689> too<00:01:12.719> long<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.320> i<00:01:13.350> need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.710> able

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
takes way too long and i need to be able

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
takes way too long and i need to be able
to<00:01:13.950> fit<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> ending<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> credits<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to fit the ending and the credits in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.160 
to fit the ending and the credits in the
same<00:01:16.590> video<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.689> takes<00:01:18.899> way<00:01:19.140> too

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
same video and it just takes way too

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.920 
same video and it just takes way too
long<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.090> over<00:01:21.329> time<00:01:21.539> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
long and don't want to go over time so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
long and don't want to go over time so
but<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.430> they're<00:01:23.609> not<00:01:23.729> be

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
but basically so and they're not be

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
but basically so and they're not be
difficult<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.329> get<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.929> pc<00:01:25.289> version

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
difficult to get out in the pc version

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
difficult to get out in the pc version
and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> ps2<00:01:26.280> version<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:26.850> bit

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and the ps2 version there a little bit

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.749 
and the ps2 version there a little bit
tricky<00:01:27.329> because<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> controls<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> yeah<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
tricky because the controls but yeah the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.319 
tricky because the controls but yeah the
orbs<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.469> he<00:01:31.619> takes<00:01:31.829> damage<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.700> seem<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
orbs when he takes damage they seem to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
orbs when he takes damage they seem to
take<00:01:33.570> damage<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:34.229> him<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.369> once<00:01:35.729> you've

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
take damage more him and so once you've

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.499 
take damage more him and so once you've
hit<00:01:36.060> him<00:01:36.179> enough<00:01:36.390> times<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.140> orbs<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:38.509> all

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
hit him enough times the orbs will all

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
hit him enough times the orbs will all
be<00:01:39.990> destroyed<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.039> actually

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
be destroyed and then he can actually

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
be destroyed and then he can actually
start<00:01:41.579> taking<00:01:41.939> damage<00:01:42.090> himself

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
start taking damage himself

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
start taking damage himself
so<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.150> will<00:01:45.240> start<00:01:45.540> scoring<00:01:46.049> vortigaunts

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
so and he will start scoring vortigaunts

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
so and he will start scoring vortigaunts
and<00:01:46.740> other<00:01:46.830> enemies<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.580> fight<00:01:47.790> but

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
when I started hitting him how he starts

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.260 
when I started hitting him how he starts
connecting<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> warps<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.030> stuff

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
connecting to all the warps and stuff

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.660 
connecting to all the warps and stuff
and<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:09.539> he<00:02:09.600> starts<00:02:09.929> absorbing<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.670> think

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and how he starts absorbing them think

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.660 
and how he starts absorbing them think
that's<00:02:11.850> how<00:02:12.060> he's<00:02:13.160> avoiding<00:02:14.160> taking<00:02:14.489> damage

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that's how he's avoiding taking damage

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.720 
that's how he's avoiding taking damage
as<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.270> see<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.560> more<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.340> orbs

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
as you can see the more and more orbs

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.100 
as you can see the more and more orbs
are<00:02:17.910> starting<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.269> drawn<00:02:18.540> into<00:02:18.750> his<00:02:18.900> head

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
are starting to get drawn into his head

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.690 
are starting to get drawn into his head
his<00:02:19.350> head<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.650> starting<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.980> open<00:02:20.130> up<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.489> little

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
his head is starting to open up a little

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.479 
his head is starting to open up a little
bit<00:02:20.850> now<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> portals<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.830> attempt<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
bit now the portals you can attempt to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.410 
bit now the portals you can attempt to
avoid<00:02:23.820> them<00:02:24.060> by<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.130> long<00:02:26.880> jumping<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
avoid them by you know long jumping and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210 
avoid them by you know long jumping and
that<00:02:27.510> sort<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.410> didn't<00:02:28.980> manage

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
that sort of thing but I didn't manage

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.280 
that sort of thing but I didn't manage
to<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.459> away<00:02:29.519> from<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.959> now<00:02:31.080> his

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
to get away from that one but so now his

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.840 
to get away from that one but so now his
head<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.470> opening<00:02:31.950> up<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.190> bit<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.519> all<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
head is opening up a bit and all the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.330 
head is opening up a bit and all the
orbs<00:02:33.630> are<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:34.260> been<00:02:34.470> destroyed<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.280> we

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
orbs are have been destroyed so now we

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
orbs are have been destroyed so now we
can<00:02:35.610> actually<00:02:35.940> attempt<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.600> some<00:02:36.780> damage

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
can actually attempt to do some damage

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.410 
can actually attempt to do some damage
to<00:02:37.260> him<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.530> potentially<00:02:37.950> French<00:02:38.160> mom<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.300> as

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
to him and potentially French mom so as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930 
to him and potentially French mom so as
you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.620> large<00:02:40.950> orb<00:02:41.250> has<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:41.580> formed

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
you can see one large orb has now formed

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.630 
you can see one large orb has now formed
its<00:02:42.239> head<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:45.470> if<00:02:46.470> we<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.100> get<00:02:47.220> high<00:02:47.489> enough

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
its head and if we can get high enough

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.840 
its head and if we can get high enough
to<00:02:48.000> actually<00:02:48.150> get<00:02:48.480> over<00:02:48.720> his<00:02:48.840> head<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.079> we<00:02:49.290> can

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
to actually get over his head and we can

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.270 
to actually get over his head and we can
open<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.329> our

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
open it up with our

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.010 
open it up with our
both<00:02:54.280> damage<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.910> his<00:02:55.120> core

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
both damage to his core

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.570 
both damage to his core
which<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.770> thought<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:57.980> wasn't<00:02:58.220> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.460> be

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
which I thought I wasn't going to be

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.070 
which I thought I wasn't going to be
able<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.820> hit<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.030> enough<00:02:59.270> but<00:02:59.540> right<00:02:59.900> when<00:03:00.020> I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
able to hit it enough but right when I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.870 
able to hit it enough but right when I
run<00:03:00.290> out<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.440> ammo<00:03:00.770> there<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.100> go<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> killed<00:03:01.730> him

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
run out of ammo there we go I killed him

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.650 
run out of ammo there we go I killed him
so<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.020> it<00:03:03.230> we<00:03:03.440> defeated<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.130> final<00:03:04.520> boss

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
so that's it we defeated the final boss

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.270 
so that's it we defeated the final boss
that<00:03:05.660> wasn't<00:03:06.020> too<00:03:06.140> hard<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.920> wasn't<00:03:07.190> too

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that wasn't too hard and it wasn't too

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.930 
rather an anti-climax after what you've
just<00:05:07.640> survived

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.730 

to<00:05:14.570> choose

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.110 

it's<00:05:24.000> wisely<00:05:25.000> done<00:05:25.479> mr.<00:05:26.259> Freeman<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.099> will<00:05:27.789> see

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
so that's it that's the end of half life

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.260 
so that's it that's the end of half life
took<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.800> little<00:05:49.039> bit<00:05:49.250> longer<00:05:49.610> than<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.120> intended

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
took a little bit longer than I intended

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.230 
took a little bit longer than I intended
but<00:05:51.020> now<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.620> it's<00:05:51.740> done<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.090> can<00:05:53.090> honestly

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
but now that it's done I can honestly

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.320 
but now that it's done I can honestly
say<00:05:53.509> that<00:05:53.990> was<00:05:54.490> quite<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.550> lot<00:05:55.759> of<00:05:55.910> fun<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.270> I

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
if you like the fact that the character

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.029

more<00:07:04.580> photogenic<00:07:05.300> ly<00:07:05.720> than<00:07:05.900> this<00:07:06.020> one<00:07:06.260> being

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
more photogenic ly than this one being

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.760 
more photogenic ly than this one being
