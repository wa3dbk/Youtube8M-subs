slider that i got for linds rentals com
today<00:00:11.389> at<00:00:12.389> first<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.960> seemed<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.530> little<00:00:13.940> weird

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
today at first it seemed a little weird

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.630 
today at first it seemed a little weird
and<00:00:15.960> I've<00:00:16.529> only<00:00:16.680> had<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.890> couple<00:00:16.949> hours<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.460> play

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and I've only had a couple hours to play

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
with it but i think i've got some some

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
with it but i think i've got some some
solid<00:00:19.680> thoughts<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.220> far<00:00:20.250> i<00:00:20.869> only<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.990> one

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
solid thoughts so far i only have one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.650 
solid thoughts so far i only have one
tripod<00:00:22.590> mounted<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.000> doesn't<00:00:24.300> seem<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
tripod mounted on but it doesn't seem to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.359 
tripod mounted on but it doesn't seem to
have<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.960> mount<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.800> ends<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.189> some

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
have the mount of the two ends like some

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.310 
have the mount of the two ends like some
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> other<00:00:26.760> sliders<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.570> I've<00:00:27.689> seen<00:00:27.960> do

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.709 

so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.859> tried<00:00:32.489> mounting<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> tripod<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so I tried mounting the tripod in the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
so I tried mounting the tripod in the
middle<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> immediate<00:00:35.070> problems

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
middle and one of the immediate problems

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.420 
middle and one of the immediate problems
was<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.540> slider<00:00:36.899> refused<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.040> past

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
was that this slider refused to go past

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
was that this slider refused to go past
the<00:00:38.910> halfway<00:00:39.149> point<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.590> due<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the halfway point and that was due to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
the halfway point and that was due to
the<00:00:41.010> screw<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> camera<00:00:41.940> mounts<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.600> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the screw that the camera mounts on I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
the screw that the camera mounts on I'm
hanging<00:00:43.680> too<00:00:43.890> low<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.520> hitting<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
hanging too low and actually hitting the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.100 
hanging too low and actually hitting the
overlap<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> tripod<00:00:46.980> screw<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> after

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
overlap from the tripod screw so after

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
overlap from the tripod screw so after
some<00:00:49.410> semesta<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.730> stuck<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> few<00:00:51.360> rubber

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
some semesta that we stuck a few rubber

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.860 
some semesta that we stuck a few rubber
washers<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.670> between<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> tripod<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
washers in between the tripod and the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 
washers in between the tripod and the
slider<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> make<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> gap<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.910> less

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
slider to make that gap a little less

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.229 
slider to make that gap a little less
and<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.780> took<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.879> screw<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and then we took the screw in here and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.369 
and then we took the screw in here and
we're<00:01:03.329> able<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> tighten<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.170> bit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
we're able to tighten it a little bit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
we're able to tighten it a little bit
more<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.799> had<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.280> clear<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
more so we had a little more clear so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.880 
more so we had a little more clear so
now<00:01:06.030> it'll<00:01:06.240> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.720> across

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
now it'll make it all the way across

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
now it'll make it all the way across
right<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> still<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> bit<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> seesaw

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
right now it still has a bit of a seesaw

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
right now it still has a bit of a seesaw
action<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> rubber<00:01:10.140> washers<00:01:10.590> but

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
action because of the rubber washers but

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
action because of the rubber washers but
we're<00:01:10.920> gonna<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.100> fix<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.479> bit

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
we're gonna go fix that a little bit

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.890 
we're gonna go fix that a little bit
later<00:01:12.810> um<00:01:13.760> other<00:01:14.760> than<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.360> seems<00:01:15.570> pretty

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
later um other than that it seems pretty

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
later um other than that it seems pretty
secure<00:01:16.170> initially<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.100> seemed<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
secure initially it seemed to be kind of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
secure initially it seemed to be kind of
sticky<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.200> Jam<00:01:19.500> partially

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sticky where it would Jam partially

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.080 
sticky where it would Jam partially
across<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:22.020> um<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:23.280> run<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.790> solid

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
across but um as I've run it a solid

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
across but um as I've run it a solid
couple<00:01:24.869> bunch<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.259> times<00:01:25.500> over<00:01:25.830> back<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
couple bunch of times over back and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
couple bunch of times over back and
forth<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> seems<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.360> smooth<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
forth now it seems pretty smooth and I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
forth now it seems pretty smooth and I
loosened<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> carriage<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
loosened up the carriage a little bit so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.219 
loosened up the carriage a little bit so
I've<00:01:30.270> been<00:01:30.420> getting<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.869> i<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.110> consider

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I've been getting what i would consider

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.740 
I've been getting what i would consider
some<00:01:31.710> decent<00:01:32.070> moves<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
some decent moves out of it

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.490 
some decent moves out of it
other<00:01:35.750> thoughts<00:01:37.480> see<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.510> have<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.930> manfrotto

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
other thoughts see I have a manfrotto

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
50mm eater 1.8 or the tamarind 24 to 72

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.050 
50mm eater 1.8 or the tamarind 24 to 72
point<00:01:53.360> eight<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.280> relatively<00:01:55.640> light

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
point eight so it's a relatively light

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.910 
point eight so it's a relatively light
setup<00:01:56.540> I'm<00:01:56.720> not<00:01:56.810> sure<00:01:56.900> how<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.200> slider<00:01:57.590> would

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.860 
setup I'm not sure how the slider would
do<00:01:58.160> with<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.200> heavier<00:02:00.200> set<00:02:00.560> up<00:02:01.750> only<00:02:02.750> other

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
do with a heavier set up only other

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.120 
do with a heavier set up only other
thing<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.110> would<00:02:03.200> recommend<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.950> leave

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
thing I would recommend is if you leave

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.410 
thing I would recommend is if you leave
the<00:02:04.280> strap<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.640> there<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:04.910> really<00:02:05.120> annoying

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
the strap on there it's really annoying

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.580 
the strap on there it's really annoying
and<00:02:05.479> runs<00:02:05.660> into<00:02:05.840> things<00:02:06.110> lot<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:06.500> I'd

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and runs into things lot so I'd

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.230 
and runs into things lot so I'd
recommend<00:02:06.710> taking<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.460> strap<00:02:07.700> off<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
recommend taking the strap off if you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.410 
recommend taking the strap off if you
have<00:02:08.420> them<00:02:08.540> already<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:11.030> here's<00:02:11.209> some<00:02:11.330> more
