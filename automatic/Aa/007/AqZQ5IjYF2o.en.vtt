00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.490
 nameless turkey August 2013 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.940
 when digging in the place of a church 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.360
 from the 7th century archaeologists discover a 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.210
 amazing object a small box that 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.520
 contains a piece of wood that some 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.080
 believe they could come from the same cross 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.080
 in which Jesus was crucified 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.650
 According to ancient historical accounts the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.530
 remains of the so-called true cross 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.670
 they were discovered in jerusalem in the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.830
 year 326 of our era by elena augusta 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.380
 the mother of the Constantine emperor 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.750
 big the mother of constantino was a 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.670
 Christian devotee and one of the places 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.540
 that he thought he had discovered was the place 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.050
 where Jesus was crucified 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.240
 while digging he found a piece of what 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.670
 that he believed was the authentic cross of Jesus 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.400
 I know 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.119
 he was brought back to constantino in 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.119
 constantinople 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.390
 in this legend, pieces of the cross were 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.030
 distributed to churches for all 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.530
 constantinople in what is today istanbul 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.600
 Turkey 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.670
 eager to preserve any 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.460
 physical evidence of life and teaching 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.830
 of Jesus the early Christian church 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.340
 he explored the holy land with enthusiasm 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.869
 looking for relics as is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.450
 including drops of Jesus' blood 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.899
 the chalice he gave me during 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 last Supper 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.550
 and even the burial shroud of his funeral 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.530
 but we do not have any artifact that 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.130
 we can definitely associate with the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.230
 own jesus the holy grail the cup of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.110
 the one who drank at the last dinner the clothes 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.330
 who dressed or something like that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.250
 in fact we could have a glass of the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.250
 that Jesus drank but we would never know 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 but objects like these also 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.050
 they validated the importance of the land 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.380
 holy as the epicenter of worship 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.690
 Christian was here according to the new 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.280
 testament where jesus was born 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.760
 where I walk where he was baptized and where 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.099
 was executed 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.750
 but of all the places associated with 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:45.780
 Jesus maybe none is more important 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.569
 no more sacred than jerusalem 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.970
 given in jerusalem jesus was raised 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.709
 jerusalem ascended from jerusalem 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 jerusalem was the center of the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.720
 early Christianity for centuries so 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.030
 it could be said that there is an attraction 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.180
 gravity of the Christian faith towards 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 city ​​of jerusalem so for the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.840
 Christendom 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.180
 jerusalem becomes a kind of 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.569
 navel of the world a sacred space 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.800
 from where the spirit of god flows to 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.800
 all humanity 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.570
 according to the four gospels of the new 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.870
 testament jesus was crucified in a 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.660
 hill called Calvary known in the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.730
 bible like a drop goal on the outskirts 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.450
 from the walled city of the old 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.879
 jerusalem and it was here in the year 326 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.310
 where the Constantine emperor built 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.530
 the church of the holy sepulcher after 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.019
 that his mother discovered the so-called cross 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.720
 true the church of the holy sepulcher 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.790
 It is considered the most sacred place in 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.500
 Christianity is located in the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.290
 site where it is believed that Jesus was 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.910
 crucified buried and since then 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.830
 he rose from the dead 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.080
 in fact the mount where jesus was 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.780
 crucified is covered by his own 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.489
 church rebuilt in 1149 the church 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.860
 now it is shared by several 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.230
 Christian denominations this is 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.880
 obviously a very desirable place to 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.940
 that the Christian sects be established 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.010
 so to speak and we have the presence 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.660
 of at least six of these sects that 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.690
 they have parts of the saint's church 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.690
 tomb 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.199
 the orthodox Greeks control the greatest 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.749
 part of the church followed by the 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.539
 Roman Catholics and other groups 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:35.370
 Christians and the relationships between these 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.090
 several Christian groups are not very 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.889
 good because they are very territorial like that 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.710
 that we can have a priest 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.229
 Roman Catholic cleaning part of the floor 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.289
 and invades the area controlled by the 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.319
 orthodox greeks and a fight starts 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.319
 of brooms certainly this kind of 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.770
 competition among religious groups in 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.770
 the most sacred place in Christianity 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.080
 creates many questions if these groups do not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.659
 can get along who can 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.780
 but the church of the holy sepulcher is 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.960
 just one of many religious sites in 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.630
 the biblical stories of the life of Jesus 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.180
 located on a hill that was once 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.030
 covered by olive trees the mountain of 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.990
 olive trees lies at the eastern end of the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.210
 ancient jerusalem 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.550
 according to the book of events of the 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.310
 apostles of the new testament was here 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.050
 from where Jesus ascended to heaven and 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.120
 Many faithful Christians believe that 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.730
 it will also be here where jesus will appear 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.730
 When the judgment day returns 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.870
 If you look at Jerusalem there is a whole 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.570
 hill of tombs in the hill of the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.270
 olive trees and outside of jerusalem 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.140
 there is an orthodox belief that 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.150
 When the messiah arrives he will go there first 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.150
 so the people buried there 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.730
 will come out of their graves and that in fact 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.000
 appears in the gospel of Matthew you have 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.430
 of all some expect a very literal 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.409
 second coming of Jesus returning to the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.649
 Mount of Olives and some who see it 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.830
 really like a more symbolic return 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:23.210
 but it is very difficult to unify these 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.669
 different points of view 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.090
 Jesus was very clear about his return he 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.680
 not specific about when it would happen to 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.680
 fact warns us about not giving a 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.259
 date and an hour for it although the 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.960
 Christians like the Jews believe that 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:41.060
 they have right over jerusalem does not exist 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.129
 mention of a promised land in the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.540
 new Testament 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:49.810
 Jesus himself never mentioned it 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.420
 instead he assured that his kingdom does not 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.980
 it was from this land but in reality 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.980
 I was in heaven 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.990
 however in the 11th century of our 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.180
 It was Christian armies of Europe 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.189
 Western began a series of 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.180
 crusades to retake jerusalem's 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.180
 Muslim control 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.300
 so there was that idea that the 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.910
 Christians had to recover the lands 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.950
 for Christianity specifically 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.610
 Jerusalem but that's not in the 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.610
 writings 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.430
 the Christians said the Muslims 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.800
 they are the power of evil and we are 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.690
 the people of God we will go and destroy 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.910
 to the Muslims and we will recover 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.600
 jerusalem for god and that was the beginning 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.720
 of the first crusade 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.360
 but despite 300 years of brutal and 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.100
 bloody military battles the earth 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.090
 santa has remained under control 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.919
 Muslim 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.900
 but why was it so important 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.870
 land that Muslims would fight so 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.620
 fiercely to retain his control in 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:58.120
 special if the mecca in Saudi Arabia is 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.280
 a most sacred place 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.270
 the answer could be found in the 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.270
 pages of the bible
