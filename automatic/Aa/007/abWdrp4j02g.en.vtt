 hello and welcome to hartz iv in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 this video the technology news of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.639
 calendar week 25 2014 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 Apple offers a new imac 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 Sparpreis at 4100 euro one receives 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 about the hardware of a 400 euro 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.699
 computers in a 21 5 inch full hd 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 screen the best new feature 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 However, apple has come up with it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 he does not eat up batram this becomes 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.269
 namely now firmly killed as he remains 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 always at 8 gb 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.340
 also installed is a 1 4 ghz dual 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.109
 core intel core i5 with a turbo boost 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 from up to 2.7 gigahertz 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.890
 besides , it had a relative 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 strong though imax weak 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 intel hd 5000 graphics unit 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.040
 By default me ​​is a 500 gb 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.829
 hdd this chamber though 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 inexpensive for just 250 gb 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 against a 256 gb ssd swap altogether 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.430
 a great offer from apple for everyone 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.559
 saver 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 Amazon makes its first own smartphone 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.750
 in front of the feyr vo is of course full and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.629
 the firefly focused on amazon 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 function is supposed to be books games dvds cds 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 urls phone number qr codes and barcodes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 recognize the scanned products can 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.510
 one then at amazon shopping can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 in addition, the microphone for music recognition 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 use 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.689
 to the technical data it has a 47 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.210
 inch big ips touchscreen with hd and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.979
 as lars gorilla glass 3 as a processor 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 was installed the qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.950
 800 with 4 times 2 2 ghz 2 gb 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 RAM 1 32 or 64 gigabytes 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 flash memory on the back is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.799
 a 3 10 megapixel camera with optical 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.650
 image stabilizer and on the front 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.840
 whole 4 display cameras these are for 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.369
 The head movements there in four pieces 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.930
 if the user is a camera 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.000
 it does not mind hiding and that 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.070
 Display can also display objects with 3d 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.140
 can show effects for example 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
 in the card 3d appartement building plastic 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 to be displayed in the card material 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 For the time being it will only be in the smartphone 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.720
 the usa and from july 2014 to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
 The 32GB version is available for sale 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.149
 It will be without a contract for 650 dollars 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 give the equivalent of 84 euros the 64 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.640
 gb model then for $ 100 on this 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.320
 Prices then come on the taxes 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.819
 trade also appears for linux amd 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.229
 brings after big demand from 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.790
 game development yours 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.280
 graphic interface coat too 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.930
 awarded 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.459
 the main reason for this is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.830
 probably it was operating system 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.050
 demo it be it all timo it plays 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.160
 For Mandl this could be the topic 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.660
 sheens the same price 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.180
 performance ratio like the consoles 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.459
 achieve plus cheaper games 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 amd has mandl designed so free that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.180
 also theoretically intel and nvidia the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.500
 However, drivers are likely to pack 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.150
 they are still refusing 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.280
 probably it's because that's it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.280
 simply too few games are when coat 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.330
 for linux appears but is still 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.610
 incredible brings your own hand 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.739
 keep steam out it's on 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.660
 the design of the team controller has 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.880
 a five inch display in 16 9 format 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.060
 two touchpads and four additional ones 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.340
 keys are installed 4 gb ram and a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.739
 quad core processor most likely 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.920
 an interview or an all in 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.650
 Internet are 32 GB of memory installed and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.130
 it offers wifi and 3g 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.380
 most likely home again 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.860
 use that in home streaming 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.110
 his 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.550
 when steam in home streaming takes over 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.920
 the calculation of the game is another 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.510
 pc this stream then the game on the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
 steam boy the team speaks, however 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.090
 that you only play with him 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.709
 can play 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.239
 but then three titles will be 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.090
 probably not be possible 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.299
 Amd wants its efficiency for years 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.329
 2020 increase to 25 times amd 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.190
 from 2008 to 2014 they have 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.260
 the increase in normal use order 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.209
 The factor 10 managed you want too 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
 until 2020 still a big shovel 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.780
 you want to do this with yours 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.060
 you want to create a conclusion 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.829
 Graphics unit and cpu connect more 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.220
 to make better use of resources 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.470
 can 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.109
 also, of course, new architectural tours 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.560
 and smaller manufacturing process intel 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.910
 has updated his roadmap the hsw 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.739
 processors replace the ivy bridge 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.890
 will be com at the end of the third quarter resp 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.560
 beginning of the quarterly 2014 broadway 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.840
 should appear for the pc in early 2015 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.060
 skylink wants to be the successor of Roth 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.549
 already presented to computings 2015 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.040
 so be pretty close after red 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.350
 release that would mean sky control 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.170
 will exist at the same time 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.320
 the transferable skycar processors 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.609
 but should not appear until 2016 what 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.289
 also with the technology news for this 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.310
 week if the video you liked 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.180
 goes up in a thumb 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.470
 if you want to load but there 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.470
 then until the next video
