so<00:01:20.660> other<00:01:20.900> than<00:01:21.140> its<00:01:21.290> durability<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.220> first

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
so other than its durability the first

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.800 
so other than its durability the first
thing<00:01:22.640> you're<00:01:22.790> likely<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.120> notice<00:01:23.510> about<00:01:23.600> the
