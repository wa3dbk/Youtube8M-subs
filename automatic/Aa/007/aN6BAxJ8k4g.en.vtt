multiply it by a which equals 1024 right

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.680 
multiply it by a which equals 1024 right
so<00:01:47.540> i'll<00:01:47.660> type<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:49.479> 1024<00:01:50.619> yeah<00:01:51.619> there<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.570> then

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
so i'll type in 1024 yeah there and then

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.870 
so i'll type in 1024 yeah there and then
we'll<00:01:53.840> click<00:01:54.110> first<00:01:54.410> scan<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.100> you'll<00:01:55.700> see
