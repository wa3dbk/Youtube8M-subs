00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
even though somehow a clone managed to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569

open<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.369> portal<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> acid<00:01:33.360> flows<00:01:33.659> right

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
open up this portal and acid flows right

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
open up this portal and acid flows right
out<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:34.770> over<00:01:35.040> 24<00:01:35.880> flood<00:01:36.210> getting

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
can sense something about him or she can

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
can sense something about him or she can
see<00:01:50.130> something<00:01:50.520> i'm<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.880> sure<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> was

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
see something i'm not sure what it was

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.350 
see something i'm not sure what it was
but<00:01:52.100> he<00:01:53.100> keeps<00:01:53.280> fooling<00:01:53.640> her<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> good

and so that's a upper hand for now to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.110 
and so that's a upper hand for now to
that<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.290> he<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> chance

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120

and love you then that's basically did

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.720 
and love you then that's basically did
the<00:03:23.850> glimpse<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.709> Saskia<00:03:26.100> does<00:03:26.310> manage

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
the glimpse of it so Saskia does manage

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.970 
the glimpse of it so Saskia does manage
to<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:27.180> through<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:28.050> that's<00:03:28.230> good<00:03:28.530> sauce<00:03:28.800> is

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
to get through so that's good sauce is

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.870 
to get through so that's good sauce is
now<00:03:29.100> with<00:03:29.400> them<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.090> are<00:03:30.300> they<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> same

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
now with them but are they in the same

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.170 
now with them but are they in the same
universe<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:33.150> Universal<00:03:33.810> same<00:03:34.110> dimension<00:03:34.770> as

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
universe not Universal same dimension as

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.210 
universe not Universal same dimension as
naruto<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.600> because<00:03:37.410> that's<00:03:37.739> another<00:03:38.010> issue

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
naruto now because that's another issue

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.010 
naruto now because that's another issue
now<00:03:38.459> because<00:03:38.910> didn't<00:03:39.330> tell<00:03:39.450> about<00:03:39.600> something

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
now because didn't tell about something

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.750 
now because didn't tell about something
I<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.040> order<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> same<00:03:41.610> actually

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
I think the order in the same actually

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.820 
I think the order in the same actually
cuz<00:03:42.120> remotely<00:03:42.780> did<00:03:42.930> teleport<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.440> some<00:03:43.590> place

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
cuz remotely did teleport to some place

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.160 
cuz remotely did teleport to some place
I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.190> they<00:03:44.280> went<00:03:44.430> back<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.540> that's<00:03:45.750> good<00:03:46.019> I

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
I think they went back so that's good I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.750 
I think they went back so that's good I
think<00:03:46.440> they're<00:03:46.530> all<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> same<00:03:47.160> dimension

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
think they're all in the same dimension

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.090 
think they're all in the same dimension
now<00:03:47.910> which<00:03:48.810> means<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.260> they<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.680> find<00:03:49.950> each

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
now which means that they can find each

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.430 
now which means that they can find each
other<00:03:50.250> was<00:03:50.700> associated<00:03:51.510> sense<00:03:51.810> not<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.080> I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
other was associated sense not just I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560 
other was associated sense not just I
think<00:03:52.500> either<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.820> portal<00:03:54.180> opened<00:03:54.450> before

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
think either the portal opened before

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.110 
think either the portal opened before
and<00:03:55.050> we<00:03:55.410> sense<00:03:55.680> not<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.950> through<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.400> or<00:03:57.060> I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
and we sense not to through it or I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.970 
and we sense not to through it or I
think<00:03:57.660> North<00:03:57.870> who<00:03:58.019> may<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.410> accidentally

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
think North who may have accidentally

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.890 
think North who may have accidentally
what<00:03:59.220> into<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.610> one<00:03:59.880> and<00:03:59.910> back<00:04:00.420> out<00:04:00.630> all<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
what into this one and back out all the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930 
what into this one and back out all the
one<00:04:01.050> at<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.320> up<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.370> most<00:04:02.640> likely<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
one at it up but it's most likely the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.310 
one at it up but it's most likely the
portal<00:04:03.330> opened<00:04:03.570> up<00:04:03.660> any<00:04:03.840> sense<00:04:04.080> not<00:04:04.290> just

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
portal opened up any sense not just

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.050 
portal opened up any sense not just
chocolate<00:04:04.680> coming<00:04:04.980> out<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.250> it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
chocolate coming out of it

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
chocolate coming out of it
so<00:04:06.810> obito<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.590> softer<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.890> outer<00:04:08.040> limits

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
so obito and softer the outer limits

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.540 
so obito and softer the outer limits
actions<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:08.880> falling<00:04:09.480> fainting<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.550> yeah

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
actions like falling fainting and yeah

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.040 
actions like falling fainting and yeah
that's<00:04:12.209> pretty<00:04:12.330> much<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.599> glance<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.930> that

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
that's pretty much a glance to that

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.930 
that's pretty much a glance to that
Sasuke<00:04:13.440> it's<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:13.830> up<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.069> Saskia<00:04:14.459> not<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.819> now

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
Sasuke it's all up to Saskia not to now

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.849 
Sasuke it's all up to Saskia not to now
