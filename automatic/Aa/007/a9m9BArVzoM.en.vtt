projected so how do you do this the
first<00:01:53.340> thing<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> concept<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.840> know

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
first thing is the concept is to know

that<00:02:11.879> same<00:02:12.180> thing<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.510> was

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that same thing I was

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.589 
that same thing I was
again<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.370> actually<00:02:13.760> put<00:02:13.909> some<00:02:14.060> energy<00:02:14.180> into

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
again you actually put some energy into

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.809 
again you actually put some energy into
the<00:02:14.780> air<00:02:14.900> try<00:02:15.799> that<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.129> you're<00:02:16.250> playing<00:02:16.489> but

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
don't play loud loudly and what you'll

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.699 
don't play loud loudly and what you'll
hear<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:21.819> projected<00:02:22.819> soft<00:02:23.180> sound<00:02:23.709> now

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
hear is a projected soft sound now

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.140 
hear is a projected soft sound now
rather<00:02:24.950> than<00:02:25.159> thinking<00:02:25.459> technically<00:02:25.969> about

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
rather than thinking technically about

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.309 
rather than thinking technically about
what<00:02:26.269> you're<00:02:26.420> doing<00:02:26.659> because<00:02:26.750> I'm<00:02:26.930> never<00:02:27.109> in

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
what you're doing because I'm never in

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.949 
what you're doing because I'm never in
favor<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.219> I<00:02:28.370> said<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:28.959> being

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
favor of that like I said just being

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.780 
favor of that like I said just being
mindful<00:02:30.439> of<00:02:30.769> where<00:02:31.010> you're<00:02:31.159> playing<00:02:31.400> -

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
mindful of where you're playing -

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.629 
mindful of where you're playing -
another<00:02:32.689> thing<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.049> think<00:02:33.079> about<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
another thing to think about is the

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.929 
another thing to think about is the
instrument<00:02:35.230> or<00:02:36.230> rather<00:02:36.799> not<00:02:37.219> to<00:02:37.430> think<00:02:37.609> about

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
instrument or rather not to think about

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.149 
instrument or rather not to think about
it<00:02:38.090> because<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.900> tend<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.409> do<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.799> blow

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
it because what we tend to do is blow

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.360 
it because what we tend to do is blow
into<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:41.389> trumpet<00:02:41.920> almost<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.099> it's<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
into the trumpet almost like it's a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.309 
into the trumpet almost like it's a
receptacle<00:02:43.969> without<00:02:44.720> an<00:02:44.870> opening<00:02:45.230> at<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
receptacle without an opening at the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.780 
receptacle without an opening at the
other<00:02:45.470> end<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.739> know<00:02:45.889> you<00:02:45.919> blow<00:02:46.250> into<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
other end you know you blow into the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.309 
other end you know you blow into the
trumpet<00:02:47.150> I've<00:02:47.239> even<00:02:47.419> heard<00:02:47.510> people<00:02:47.569> say<00:02:47.959> blow

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
trumpet I've even heard people say blow

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.759 
trumpet I've even heard people say blow
into<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> trumpet<00:02:49.090> hmm<00:02:50.090> we<00:02:50.959> blow<00:02:51.169> through<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
into the trumpet hmm we blow through the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.879 
into the trumpet hmm we blow through the
trumpet<00:02:52.510> okay<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.659> a<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:54.169> small<00:02:54.650> word

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
trumpet okay it's a one small word

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.229 
trumpet okay it's a one small word
different<00:02:55.310> but<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.519> makes<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.790> big<00:02:55.939> difference

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
different but it makes a big difference

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.569 
different but it makes a big difference
to<00:02:56.299> how<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.540> think<00:02:57.169> and<00:02:57.379> how<00:02:57.889> you<00:02:57.919> feel<00:02:58.370> when

goes through the trumpet and reaches you
at<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> back<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.099> room<00:03:25.419> okay<00:03:26.419> not<00:03:26.690> into

at the back of the room okay not into

at the back of the room okay not into
the<00:03:27.319> trumpet<00:03:28.030> what<00:03:29.030> physically<00:03:29.540> happens

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the trumpet what physically happens

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.969 
the trumpet what physically happens
different<00:03:30.109> when<00:03:30.199> you<00:03:30.290> think<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.650> way<00:03:30.829> is<00:03:30.889> not

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
different when you think this way is not

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.679 
different when you think this way is not
something<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.519> need<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.699> get<00:03:31.909> involved<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.569> I'm

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
something we need to get involved in I'm

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.659 
something we need to get involved in I'm
not<00:03:32.720> even<00:03:33.049> sure<00:03:33.199> I<00:03:33.229> understand<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.979> but<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.519> do

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
not even sure I understand it but I do

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.330 
not even sure I understand it but I do
know<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.389> fact<00:03:35.449> that<00:03:35.959> if<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.680> have<00:03:36.859> in<00:03:36.979> mind

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
know for a fact that if I have in mind

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.460 
know for a fact that if I have in mind
that<00:03:37.849> I'm<00:03:38.000> blowing<00:03:38.180> through<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> trumpet<00:03:39.319> to

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that I'm blowing through the trumpet to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.909 
that I'm blowing through the trumpet to
you<00:03:40.370> rather<00:03:41.090> than<00:03:41.269> into<00:03:41.810> my<00:03:41.930> trumpet<00:03:42.349> while<00:03:42.889> I

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
you rather than into my trumpet while I

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.030 
you rather than into my trumpet while I
face<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:44.479> way<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.109> sound<00:03:45.379> projects<00:03:45.859> is

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
face you the way the sound projects is

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.429 
face you the way the sound projects is
vastly<00:03:46.759> different<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.299> all<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> know<00:03:48.139> that's

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
vastly different and all I know that's

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.839 
vastly different and all I know that's
happening<00:03:48.709> different<00:03:49.009> with<00:03:49.099> me<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.340> the

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
happening different with me is the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.809 
happening different with me is the
amount<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.209> energy<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.739> send<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.250> away<00:03:52.370> as

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
amount of energy that I send you away as

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.330 
amount of energy that I send you away as
far<00:03:53.150> greater<00:03:53.590> ok<00:03:54.590> projection<00:03:55.069> is<00:03:55.159> very

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
far greater ok projection is very

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.039 
far greater ok projection is very
important<00:03:55.790> we're<00:03:56.239> talking<00:03:56.509> about<00:03:56.659> a<00:03:56.689> lot<00:03:57.019> of
