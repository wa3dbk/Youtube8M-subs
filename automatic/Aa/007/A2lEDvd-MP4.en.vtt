00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.180
 early moore group in the heart and I am

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.470
 favorite owl an integral 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.800
 castle f4 will lead yeah so this is a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.900
 less 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.370
 this subway is that it will mean that the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.200
 pros can use it for the dk by 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.330
 example what it not anyway not 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.990
 very quickly so it's safe for the bar 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.880
 or at the restaurant 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.590
 it's not fast enough or obviously 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.940
 for people like us who have 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.899
 beautiful machines the house that 's what 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.730
 is good quality products 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.840
 exactly this is me I love this moment 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.370
 there why are we looking at the interface is 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.219
 touch here yes super easy 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 of use it's true in addition here you 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.309
 marks the little things that flees them 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.350
 defines it in fact yielded its statistics 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 of consumption that is to say by day the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.499
 number of cases did you do by 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.149
 week and from the beginning that you have the 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:51.829
 mill quite and says it on time 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.059
 in addition it's always nice to have 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.039
 in his kitchen 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.649
 and if so we can to get on these 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.359
 2 1 cup and cups competitor 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.670
 serious composing itself this figure 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.710
 in support of a place where you have to be 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.810
 so here is the favorite 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.119
 yes we tried everything that does that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.170
 that one can dream of course a coffee that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.530
 practical because we know when it's going 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.479
 stop 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 exactly so here we know if that 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.640
 overflows the big favorite party 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.409
 residents for me at one point people 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.420
 sums up so we remove just one go there 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.680
 it is that one evokes everywhere it is omar 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.050
 say that put them in a dose 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.369
 heroin just showed please 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.259
 and usually was I 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.090
 have almost everywhere must occurrence 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.740
 operate mill fiorenza early 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.270
 I think are the most mills 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.290
 precise in terms of distribution at 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.149
 cleanest world 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.070
 however it was worth the trial then pro 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.350
 this is this one or the one above 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.130
 or the others elsewhere in distribution 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.570
 like that we want more 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.950
 they are really it's europe plays 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 that it's really that's my thing 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 heart us since it is really nice 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.160
 a design level and all tastes of 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.300
 Well, that's how we buy this 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.020
 mill island have there for donkeys and 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.509
 of course his lands 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 I think we have everything 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.810
 says because it's still pretty 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.590
 simple when the maintenance 600 gm 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.880
 and 10 cents grams which is when 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.960
 even relatively big is not too much 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.300
 great to say that we are on a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.100
 competence anyway rather semi-pro 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.539
 semi-pro thanks to having doctor but 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.800
 I take the case from home if you want 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.340
 you can test it go it's gone in 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.340
 back supported
