00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hi guys this is a tutorial of how to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.220 
hi guys this is a tutorial of how to
start<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> engines<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.630> pmdg<00:00:10.290> 737<00:00:10.740> ngx<00:00:12.230> so

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
start the engines on pmdg 737 ngx so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.440 
start the engines on pmdg 737 ngx so
this<00:00:13.620> tutorial<00:00:14.130> starts<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> stage<00:00:14.940> we've<00:00:15.210> got

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
this tutorial starts the stage we've got

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.750 
this tutorial starts the stage we've got
everything<00:00:15.840> ready<00:00:15.990> set<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.189> departure

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
everything ready set up for departure

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000 
everything ready set up for departure

overhead panel and ding radios and at
this<00:00:24.420> stage<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.900> got<00:00:25.170> declared<00:00:25.560> term<00:00:25.800> ATC

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
this stage would got declared term ATC

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.480 
this stage would got declared term ATC
to<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.660> able<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> push<00:00:28.410> back<00:00:28.440> and<00:00:28.890> start<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
to be able to push back and start the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.760 
to be able to push back and start the
engines<00:00:29.910> okay<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.840> before<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.439> push<00:00:31.740> back

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
engines okay so before we push back

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.340 
engines okay so before we push back
there's<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.400> a<00:00:32.520> few<00:00:32.699> things<00:00:32.760> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:34.050> set<00:00:34.320> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.249 
movement in the tow bar as you push back
that<00:01:18.880> will<00:01:19.060> cause<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.630> dump<00:01:19.840> let's<00:01:20.050> turn

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
that will cause the your dump let's turn

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.899 
that will cause the your dump let's turn
off<00:01:20.440> as<00:01:20.679> it<00:01:20.860> won't<00:01:21.340> be<00:01:21.460> able<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.700> have

electronic a hydraulic supply sorry - it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.639 
electronic a hydraulic supply sorry - it
so<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:28.119> initiate<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.690> pushback<00:01:29.170> by<00:01:29.440> going

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
so let's initiate the pushback by going

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.249 
so let's initiate the pushback by going
to<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.800> flight<00:01:29.979> management<00:01:30.280> computer<00:01:31.259> pushed
