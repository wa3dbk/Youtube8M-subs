00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.629
 hello girls I come with a super video 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.129
 short and super simple because I want 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.500
 Tell you how you can do a 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.930
 natural nail dehydrator at home 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.570
 home and that will work us the same 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.140
 that a dehydrator bought in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.509
 any other place is worth then how 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 it is done because it is super simple 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:37.690
 you just have to mix in three 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.300
 units of alcohol by a unit of 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.449
 pure acetone is worth this will make our 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.519
 Fingernail gets dehydrated then it's like 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.380
 I do, well, look, I have here this 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.930
 magic for 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.460
 of these that have fried with the plant 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 cellulose and salts 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.510
 I want to tell you that this already provides 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.539
 I made a 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.250
 a little quantity and well I did not try it 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.269
 in my dreams I tried on the nails of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.310
 my mother and nothing of age super well equal 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.860
 that a normal dehydrator is worth 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.780
 So how do you do it? 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.090
 use it well this in dropper of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.570
 this style the little bottle I hope it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.310
 cited okay what I 'm going to do is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.690
 use it as a unit of measurement not 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 matter the unit of life you use 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.200
 whenever you use as we said 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.990
 other parts of alcohol and one of acetone 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.700
 ok then I do not know if it is appreciated in the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.159
 video here is a small 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.970
 marquita is worth then I will use 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.700
 up there as a reference it is as we have 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 said let's put a part of acetone 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.090
 pure 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.289
 a plant and pure acetone 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.289
 and now three parts of alcohol 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.079
 do not 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.319
 ok I already have a part 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.250
 Two parts 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 in three parts 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.620
 now with a bump 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.840
 I move it well 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 and I already have my nail dehydrator 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.490
 ready to use and nothing girls anymore 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.280
 we would have our dehydrator 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.130
 and you already know a part of pure acetone 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.420
 three parts of alcohol many times I 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.310
 have asked some girls if they 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.350
 you can use alcohol so you can not 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.240
 use nothing is better used when 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.920
 less alcohol and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.520
 if you can do it like that to try and I already 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.550
 you will count this when the news gets wet 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.060
 cells and pass them through the nail you will see that 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.650
 the nail really dehydrate how it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.620
 use the dehydrator because you know 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.930
 that you first have to remove cuticles in 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.020
 the preparation of the natural nail is worth 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.270
 then you have to file a little bit 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.790
 surface and only remove the brightness 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.340
 of the nail and then you have to dehydrate 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.870
 it will do what I'm worth dipping 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.090
 and masters the towel cellulose 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.700
 we would go through our natural nail and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.020
 we would wait a few seconds when you see 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.760
 that the nail is already a little 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.250
 whitish that has lost as the 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.710
 brightness then is when you have to 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.880
 Apply the primer and apply the nail 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.460
 acrylic or the gel nail is worth then 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.650
 nothing girls I hope you liked it 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.590
 the vice that helps and so 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.470
 unless it is the daughter of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.050
 save a little bit of money tickets 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.710
 for far 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.710
 someone
