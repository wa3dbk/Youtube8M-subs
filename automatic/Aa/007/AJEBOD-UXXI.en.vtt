00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.480
 hi to all users of the channel 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.460
 space games are doctor mi ax has passed 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 a lot of time from last video that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.300
 I did 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 this is because I had so many 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.330
 study commitments that brought me 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 so much time to be able to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.550
 to offer you deo for spazio games and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 whatever else we are now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.670
 come back to cody first I want 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 thank absolutely dotto white 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 for the good work done indeed very good 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.059
 work done in these first episodes 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.340
 which led to the series if there is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 remember though maybe veterans of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 channel we started with black ops 2 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.469
 and now we have arrived on ghost 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 therefore we have seen that various remigio 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.250
 analyze for example abidjan per 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.879
 example it in the budgets 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.829
 now it changes a bit more genre 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.510
 obviously the comments are fundamental 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 because you will go and tell me what 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.620
 you would like in the next episode I said 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 we went to the rifles at this point 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.740
 of mr therefore those designated marksman 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.780
 rifles ok let's leave my up 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 however, English fuci that I am one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 halfway between an assault rifle and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.310
 a sniper rifle then 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.700
 first of all the hummers there are 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 I propose in this episode lmr 28 year old 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 28 I like it because it already has the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 soccer included so you will have to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.930
 add it to the accessories then a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 very good thing 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.600
 you see it in this case use 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.570
 with the laser sight and the silencer 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.509
 then I like it very much in conformation 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.490
 assault rifle because it is very powerful 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 then the damages are very high 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 head kills with one stroke then 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.329
 very powerful to the body in this thing I am 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.200
 speaking without silencer to the body 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.280
 it simply kills with 23 shots 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.369
 obviously to the shots if you take the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.500
 enemy at the foot two in the chest 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.659
 if instead used in shotgun configuration 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 assault silenced as you have will do me 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.759
 in this case we have one 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 configuration that prepares shot 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.410
 seems in the lead and therefore still damage 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.590
 very high but in this case I have a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.040
 little we will have 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.080
 strokes in the chest area and in any case also 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.209
 legs feet then four strokes in each 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.280
 case to kill the enemy 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.440
 sure if the distances increase the blows 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 will also become 5 or 6 dependent on 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.940
 distance to where you are and also e 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.410
 especially from your accuracy me 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.569
 like to use let's say so because anyway 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.000
 very practical very fast not by chance 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.290
 I also use perks that are a lot 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.870
 let's say acts go around without being done 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.120
 feel however with a certain discretion but 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.769
 that allow a fast recharge e 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.470
 above all be ready immediately 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.019
 to action use kontron tezza then 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.599
 immediately after a run the weapon is ready 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.340
 to be used and used 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.500
 with a sleight of hand game of 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 prestige because it recharges 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 very quickly the time of the charges to which 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.739
 it is very fast and about a second e 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.860
 half two then use games of 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.480
 prestige helps you a lot to be able 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.110
 recharge quickly and start again at 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.910
 then shoot predator predator use 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.260
 because because it allows me to move 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.069
 very well and above all very much 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.769
 quickly 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.560
 when I'm facing an opponent 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.790
 so maybe opponent can continue 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.859
 to shoot me if I can move 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.569
 quickly I succeed but the ryder some 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.359
 which I then take advantage of to be able to do so 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.380
 hit with my dna 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.540
 then we also have the means of 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.389
 concealment therefore in this case no 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.299
 with regard to the terms of 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.160
 I do n't hear my footsteps 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.940
 they are silent again so 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.000
 silent 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.889
 on the map without letting me find out 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 knockdown then knockdown me 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.470
 it allows not to be able to make to discover to the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.510
 enemies where they were killed 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.540
 comrades therefore very very useful that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.530
 will know that a why in my opinion 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.470
 fundamental to be able to use 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.940
 within your class what 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.919
 I say I am very happy to be 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.419
 back on space that I can initially 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.950
 repurpose the queue videos done that 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.290
 stoner giving so much now for 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.030
 being able to get back on track and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.010
 we have a little novelty too like me 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.959
 good doctor white or set up between 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.479
