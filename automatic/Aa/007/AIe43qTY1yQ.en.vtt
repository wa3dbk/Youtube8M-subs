00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.120
 Ah yes I visited a vulnerable area ahead of the rainy season. 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:15.580
 Even at a glance, the slope is quite harsh and it is a slope. 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:20.170
 It's a cliff by the side, and right next to it is the house where the inhabitants live. 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 Just below the mountain , the townhouse was a 48th- generation palace. 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 However, you can find third state risks throughout iteotneundeyo 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.120
 Oh look good 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:40.540
 Common sense 2 mountain mountain case approximately 40 degrees 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:45.399
 There is a possibility of a landslide in the castle on the actor's mountain in the year. 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.969
 Landslides occur most frequently in slopes between 26 and 40 degrees. 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.190
 Yes 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:56.470
 The reason is that since the introduction of rainwater pick the best soil 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 It is a video that converged by voting on a scale of one tenth of a mountain in the 30 trillion 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:05.019
 By the nurses started leaking out away down completely collapsed in 10,090 seconds 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.670
 As you can see, it collapses and the body collapses suddenly. 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.950
 People collapsed 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.549
 I can not avoid it. Buy it. It was not just this. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.900
 There's no such facility as this. 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.030
 If you do not have three years of wiring to reduce the drainage of soil , 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.310
 It can hit you. 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:31.930
 There's a drain on the wall, but it's been a long time. 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.020
 As you can see in general, there is no trace of the water pipe flowing down the water 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.159
 Drainage is also itguyo also places that just over a dusty cobwebs 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.619
 The trail we'll no later Woomyunsan 3 eggs also its high apartment 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.050
 There crumbling old villas at a time so that the heavy rains and landslides 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.830
 I can not make the rest. 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:56.050
 Pack 17 in Seoul, Newborn Infants 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:02.190
 Sorin him nowhere so far itneyo This risk areas 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.190
 The problem is that the main church residence is in close proximity to vulnerable landslides 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.640
 In the first case, the recovery cost of color development increased rapidly from 2002 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.569
 I'm in a particular situation Quetta city center is late when the damage occurs much 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:22.150
 It's big. 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:27.330
 It turned out to be a virtually talented person if 18 people were in a tough and accidental climb . 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.080
 If so, what is Seoul's efforts to prevent landslides ? 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.700
 Padding will do the majoring once and then check before the rain 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.709
 Yes, and then the rain now passed another facility is not a little damage behind 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.560
 So this is now 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.660
 Three times on a regular basis. 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:50.340
 We plan landslide check that made debut rainy season in 2012 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.709
 A total of 16 people, including 2 people per week, over 200 places in the Seoul scene for 3 days 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.370
 I could confirm that I majored in. 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.370
 While even three two people one hair is now confirmed that no place 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.440
 I think it might seem a little short, 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.470
 personnel 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.080
 I'll be able to check it properly. 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.080
 I checked with a specialist on landslide vulnerable areas. 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.300
 What is the state doing there is provided a number of times now, 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.880
 Sohee to the watercourses flowing to those that can filter out these things, parsley twig gajina 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.570
 Because there is no facility, concentrate and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.950
 If this part is blocked, it looks like Hangul loop. 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.950
 Would the residential area put kiwi 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.859
 The drainage line is the water lump inside the mountain, 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:42.000
 It's a key preventive facility to prevent. Yes. 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:45.950
 However, this does not properly check facilities in residential life and the picture 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.950
 Situations where there is a great deal of damage to 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.970
 Because now, just about two mere extent required distance is almost tying the 1st 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.990
 There's no way out. Now this is on the top of the retaining wall. 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:04.540
 Well, the rainwater has penetrated, 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:08.740
 This collapse is happening because this building is lacking in landscape 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.940
 Yes, especially when I'm through cracks in the rock to rock slope 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.920
 It is said that there is a risk that rainwater will permeate and collapse in an instant. 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:22.120
 There was no safety facility for this . 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.870
 I do not know if I do not know. 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 I'm uneasy and I have three hard to talk to. 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 The housing ppaegok in the summer intensive landslides landslides occurred in areas vulnerable to 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.310
 It's more dangerous because you're sitting there. 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.160
 Meanwhile, by building codes in all areas of less than three-layer structure is a uni-black 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:50.290
 I could use the harbor to build it. 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.180
 However, in 2012, buildings in areas vulnerable to landslides are all licensed under the Law 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.300
 The revision is one vote. 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:01.540
 It is enforced from the 14th this month 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.470
 If you do that, you must make sure that you submit the structure money of the permit c 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.259
 I do. 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.930
 You have to get inside the building. 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:14.340
 In the case of budget, landslide management items have occurred after Woomyunsan landslide, 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.340
 Budget is also organized 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:25.949
 However, according to the report of the Forest Service last year , 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.949
 It is said that the annual budget for the landslide is insufficient. 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.590
 In order to prevent landslides, it is essential to install and maintain proper facilities. 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.100
 Thank you to everyone 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:41.199
 3 4 Stop behind the run facility Horan Jan Mine 4 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:45.460
 It's everywhere . It's energy. I can do it for the control facility. 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:48.880
 Through experimentation shrine of Mac forests and preventing landslides killed tube how much water 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.139
 I knew it was important. 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.520
 Next to the residence while sharply reduced the flow so that it does not install the four dams 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.520
 I was able to stop the damage. 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:05.439
 What if more acid is expected to be removed, such as through the Dasan Call Center and its ward 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:10.539
 It will be important for Will to get a drink. 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:14.740
 The're how precious life and property in the moment Asada What more landslides 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.650
 Chapter 2 Basic that can be thoroughly safeguarded receive a landslide damage 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.949
 I think this is the best way. 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.949
