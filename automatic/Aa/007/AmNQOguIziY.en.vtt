00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
sticky strip and that's how this is the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
sticky strip and that's how this is the
base<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.530> alright<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
base is going to be alright I'm going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.520 
base is going to be alright I'm going to
put<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.100> together<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.790> quick<00:01:18.530> alright

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
next you're going to cut two identical

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.580 
next you're going to cut two identical
pieces<00:01:22.950> 16<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.720> three<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.290> fourth

and sixth by three and one fourth and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
and sixth by three and one fourth and
they're<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.799> perfect<00:01:29.340> rectangles

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
they're going to be perfect rectangles

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
they're going to be perfect rectangles
and<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> piece<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and what I like to do is get a piece of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.359 
and what I like to do is get a piece of
scratch<00:01:32.909> paper<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.600> cut<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> 6<00:01:34.200> x<00:01:34.409> 3<00:01:34.650> 14<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
scratch paper and cut it 6 x 3 14 and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
scratch paper and cut it 6 x 3 14 and
fold<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> scratch<00:01:36.720> paper<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.229> half<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.740> just

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
fold the scratch paper in half and just

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.870 
fold the scratch paper in half and just
Nick<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> corners<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.829> then<00:01:40.880> it's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
Nick one of the corners and then it's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
Nick one of the corners and then it's
perfectly<00:01:42.329> symmetrical<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> on

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
perfectly symmetrical and I put this on

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.109 
perfectly symmetrical and I put this on
top<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.899> use<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.549> scratch<00:01:47.549> paper<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
top and I use that scratch paper as a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
top and I use that scratch paper as a
guide<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.439> those<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:50.220> identical<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
guide so that those are identical and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
guide so that those are identical and
symmetrical<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> three

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
symmetrical and then I take the three

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.149 
symmetrical and then I take the three
fourths<00:01:53.340> inch<00:01:53.520> punch<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.649> punch<00:01:55.979> it
