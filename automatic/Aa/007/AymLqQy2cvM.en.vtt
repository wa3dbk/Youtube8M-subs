is very important he has to go up and do
it<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.560> about<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.890> whenever<00:00:08.130> they<00:00:08.370> call<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
it here about it whenever they call a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.930 
it here about it whenever they call a
tailslide<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:10.230> get<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.740> material<00:00:11.040> all<00:00:11.670> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
tailslide to get that material all this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
tailslide to get that material all this
way<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.480> unsafe<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.230> him<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> land<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.920> way

way it's unsafe for him to land that way
so<00:00:14.610> these<00:00:14.849> seed<00:00:15.150> clouds<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.780> vertical<00:00:16.379> /<00:00:16.680> in

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
so these seed clouds go vertical / in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.640 
so these seed clouds go vertical / in
the<00:00:17.010> distance<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.940> normal<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.539> okay<00:00:18.960> he's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the distance it's normal it's okay he's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250 
the distance it's normal it's okay he's
just<00:00:20.070> doing<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:20.670> aerobatic<00:00:21.390> maneuver<00:00:21.840> to

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.480 
holding it in so they keep in the end
and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.270> turn<00:01:48.510> on<00:01:48.690> inflation<00:01:49.410> syllabus<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then turn on inflation syllabus so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.460 
and then turn on inflation syllabus so
they<00:01:50.640> hold<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.930> round<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
they hold it in you can see me round and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
they hold it in you can see me round and
only<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.920> ready<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.580> can<00:01:53.760> turn<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
