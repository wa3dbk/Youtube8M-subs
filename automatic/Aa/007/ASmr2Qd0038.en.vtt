I<00:04:13.330> think<00:04:14.330> we've<00:04:14.480> different<00:04:14.870> version<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.320> might

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
I think we've different version it might

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.890 
I think we've different version it might
be<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> bit<00:04:15.770> different<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:17.060> think<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:17.780> all

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
be a bit different but I think it's all

be a bit different but I think it's all
just<00:04:18.489> consumed
