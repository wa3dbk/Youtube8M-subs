 easy easy easy easy to should 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.140
 leave alcohol alcohol drinks 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.939
 we do not count alcoholic we are not going to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.369
 consume none of that will explain the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.279
 why I am the one who for example many 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.240
 the girls are going to a restaurant 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.109
 let's have a restaurant you can 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.909
 Mexican international whatever a 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.820
 daisy, well, did you know that 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:37.100
 margarita is full of pure sugar and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.890
 probably because of sugar that is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.989
 there are fruits considered to be a sugar already 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.829
 too much refined mind that comes from the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.140
 corn and is probably transgenic to 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.390
 at the same time these kinds of drinks that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.790
 women love 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.550
 well not all but in the majority I say 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.460
 I 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.040
 they are high in calories for example to me 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.110
 he gives me at least he was going to provide 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.119
 a cup and a half of margarita 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.780
 so that rate can have as almost 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.280
 800 to 1000 calories a daisy is 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.020
 exaggeratedly the calories that can 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.300
 have now there comes the man who does not 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.570
 my brother but what if I 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.220
 I drink a beer and that's good 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 easily with a beer and they are the ones 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.390
 they are low in calories, you too 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.149
 that the companies and their video about this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.039
 they are too full in something that 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.590
 flame fire or these jeans that is the the 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.530
 estrogen in plants that for the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.450
 man begins to balance hormones 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.070
 Now I know that he's going to see a man 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.630
 here I know not all my friend your mom 's 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.009
 sometimes yes but keep drinking beer and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.600
 you will see how it will be put as the person 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.429
 that it has been 10 or 15 years 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.289
 the bc and look how it has the belly and 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.030
 look how the body is deforming 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.580
 that's why 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.930
 So here what we have done when 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.510
 you consume alcohol or you are 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.540
 consuming something that the body does not want 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.340
 first of all it is alcohol 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.020
 a person for this week and what 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 such the wine that supposedly help from 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 salt and it's good you knew that the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.320
 Most of the wines are full of 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.990
 good extra your faults that you mark him 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.819
 they throw up for evil to preserve the wine and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 that is toxic to the liver so that 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.640
 everything that is alcohol if it will be will be that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.170
 it will be that everything that is alcohol does not have 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 nothing of benefit because maybe yes but 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.980
 look what is this today I always say that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.320
 there is not what there was if you 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.290
 they want to lose weight fast so that 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.090
 consume something that happens to him the damage one the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.580
 alcohol dehydrates the body to 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.800
 Dehydrate the body and you as it 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.160
 moisturizes what is the movement of the cone 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.720
 or the oil and you start paralysis and already 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.760
 you will be able to evacuate us 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.650
 same friends you start to liz 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 hydrate the body and the organs do not go 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.670
 to work the same you put a lot 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.790
 stress to the liver is a lot of energy that 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.500
 you are going to be required to remove that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.299
 alcohol of your body or are you going to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 have to jerry more water and that takes 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.170
 energy when we are losing weight 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 what we want to do is save energy 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.650
 to remove the excess energy is what 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.829
 we want not if we want to lose weight 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 fast do here is always your 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.579
 presence then take everything you 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 want but if you want part person of 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.430
 general with it brings absolutely nothing 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.530
 well that's it, wine and who knows what or 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.170
 I have already researched it very well 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.329
 and although they say that there are cultures that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.940
 supposedly they took they drink wine and from 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.310
 how many years but whatever friends 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.380
 is this if you want to go down 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.640
 despite the reflex case we see ourselves 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.079
 subscribe to that channel if they have not done so 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.540
 they still share this video that a 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.579
 person who does if he only takes 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 liquor and he wonders why he did not come down from 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.340
 therefore probably the liquor to which 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.019
 I 'm hurting him and he's 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.700
 dehydrating the body and I recommend them 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.290
 a lot of stress on the liver and when you will 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
 you put a lot this rich you are going to produce the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.940
 other cholesterol then it's a mess 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.049
 I love you very much and see you 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.049
