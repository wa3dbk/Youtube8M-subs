00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
exotic I think they're from Southeast
Asia<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.590> may<00:00:19.740> maybe<00:00:20.369> pan-indian<00:00:21.029> they

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
Asia but they may maybe pan-indian they

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.740 
Asia but they may maybe pan-indian they
may<00:00:21.510> go<00:00:21.689> into<00:00:21.830> Africa<00:00:22.970> pan<00:00:23.970> Indian<00:00:24.300> Ocean<00:00:24.630> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
may go into Africa pan Indian Ocean that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.980 
may go into Africa pan Indian Ocean that
is<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> genus<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.550> gloriosa<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
is and the genus is gloriosa and the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
is and the genus is gloriosa and the
common<00:00:28.320> name<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> Gloria<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.130> Lily<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.670> couple

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
common name is Gloria so Lily a couple

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.460

other like flame Lily and stuff like

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
other like flame Lily and stuff like
that<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> guess<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that I'm going to guess that this is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540 
that I'm going to guess that this is
superba<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.469> take<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> look<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> flower

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
superba but take a look at the flower

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.400 
superba but take a look at the flower
and<00:00:35.910> correct<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.329> there's<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.600> 10<00:00:36.870> species

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and correct me there's like 10 species

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.040 
and correct me there's like 10 species
that<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> could<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that are that I could find in one of the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
that are that I could find in one of the
books<00:00:41.000> but<00:00:42.000> judging<00:00:42.270> by<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> flower<00:00:43.250> alone

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
books but judging by the flower alone

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970 
books but judging by the flower alone
I'm<00:00:44.579> thinking<00:00:45.059> suburban<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.780> I'm<00:00:45.989> totally

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
I'm thinking suburban but I'm totally

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
I'm thinking suburban but I'm totally
ignorant<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> looks

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
ignorant I don't know but just it looks

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
ignorant I don't know but just it looks
like<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> flower<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.910> used<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
like the flower that that was used to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.750 
like the flower that that was used to
describe<00:00:51.620> superba<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> deciduous

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
describe superba it's a deciduous

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.950 
describe superba it's a deciduous
perennial<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.840> all

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
perennial and you know so this will all

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
perennial and you know so this will all

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
in hardscrabble environment right now

back and most of the other woody stuff
in<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.799> died<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> tough<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
in here died so it is tough but I just

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.109 
in here died so it is tough but I just
haven't<00:01:26.310> mastered<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.850> art<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
haven't mastered the art of

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.609 
haven't mastered the art of
transplanting<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:27.960> yet<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.350> sure<00:01:28.500> it's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
transplanting them yet but I'm sure it's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
transplanting them yet but I'm sure it's
not<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.950> hard<00:01:29.189> probably<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.909> my<00:01:30.000> laziness

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
not that hard probably just my laziness

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.700 
not that hard probably just my laziness
that<00:01:30.720> killed<00:01:30.960> them

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that killed them

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
that killed them
so<00:01:32.130> anyway<00:01:32.369> gloriosa<00:01:33.030> Lily<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.840> other

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so anyway gloriosa Lily the one other

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.600 
so anyway gloriosa Lily the one other
notable<00:01:34.290> thing<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.799> they're<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> cult<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
notable thing is they're in a cult see a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
notable thing is they're in a cult see a
CA<00:01:35.970> family<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> probably<00:01:36.960> butchered<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
CA family and I probably butchered that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
CA family and I probably butchered that
pronunciation<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.880> important<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pronunciation but the important thing is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.639 
pronunciation but the important thing is
they<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.750> colchicine<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.939> which<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
they have colchicine in them which is a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.050 
they have colchicine in them which is a
mutagenic<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.950> guess<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.610> lack<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.939> better

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
mutagenic I guess for lack of a better

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
mutagenic I guess for lack of a better
word<00:01:45.329> best<00:01:45.960> thing<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.290> come<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.680> right

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
word best thing I can come up with right

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700 
word best thing I can come up with right
now<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.189> creates<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> polyploidy<00:01:48.960> expression

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
now it creates a polyploidy expression

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
now it creates a polyploidy expression
in<00:01:49.829> plants<00:01:50.310> versus<00:01:50.759> diploid<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.450> triploid

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
in plants versus diploid or triploid

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.240 
in plants versus diploid or triploid
sets<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:54.720> scrambles<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> genetics<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sets it it scrambles the genetics so you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
sets it it scrambles the genetics so you
can<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> whole<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> varied<00:01:57.600> expression

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
can get a whole lot of varied expression

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.010 
can get a whole lot of varied expression
in<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.189> simple<00:01:59.549> plant<00:01:59.990> when<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
in a in a simple plant when you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.039 
in a in a simple plant when you
introduce<00:02:01.560> colchicine<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> seed<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.049> our

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
introduce colchicine to a seed or our

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.170 
introduce colchicine to a seed or our
germinating<00:02:04.770> seed<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.430> i<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.759> understand

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
germinating seed so i don't understand

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
germinating seed so i don't understand
all<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.469> interesting<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.190> can

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
all of that but it's interesting I can

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
all of that but it's interesting I can
get<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.149> freaky<00:02:09.569> mutants<00:02:09.929> basically

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
get you can get freaky mutants basically

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150 
get you can get freaky mutants basically
when<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> use<00:02:11.220> colchicine<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:13.160> developing

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
when you use colchicine in a developing

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.750 
when you use colchicine in a developing
embryo<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.360> plant<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.080> once<00:02:16.739> again<00:02:16.860> gloriosa

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
embryo of a plant so once again gloriosa

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
embryo of a plant so once again gloriosa
Lily<00:02:18.500> real<00:02:19.500> pretty<00:02:19.800> flowers<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.459> mean<00:02:20.610> these

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
Lily real pretty flowers I mean these

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.369 
Lily real pretty flowers I mean these
things<00:02:20.819> always<00:02:21.360> catch<00:02:21.569> my<00:02:21.780> attention<00:02:21.810> then

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
things always catch my attention then

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.830 
things always catch my attention then
they<00:02:22.530> grow<00:02:22.739> feral<00:02:23.280> around<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.090> they

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
they grow feral around here so they

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
they grow feral around here so they
stand<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.410> when<00:02:25.650> they're<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> bloom<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
stand out when they're in bloom and the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.820 
stand out when they're in bloom and the
leaf<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.390> plant<00:02:27.690> form<00:02:27.989> itself<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
leaf the plant form itself is kind of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.339 
leaf the plant form itself is kind of
neat<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.160> sort<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.550> scanning<00:02:30.030> mine<00:02:30.349> climbs

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
neat it's sort of a scanning mine climbs

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.570 
neat it's sort of a scanning mine climbs
this<00:02:31.530> way<00:02:31.709> I've<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:31.890> these<00:02:32.250> little<00:02:32.459> hooks

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this way I've got these little hooks

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
this way I've got these little hooks
these<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.030> tendrils<00:02:33.390> sorry<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> might<00:02:34.019> be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
these little tendrils sorry it might be

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.880 
these little tendrils sorry it might be
too<00:02:34.349> close<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.670> anyway<00:02:36.000> I'm<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.569> about

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
too close there but anyway I'm up about

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.920 
too close there but anyway I'm up about
gloriosa<00:02:37.890> Lily
