00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.630
 hello to all for those who do not 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.880
 would not know yet followed at 6 years old 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.380
 green offered 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.359
 eat been ranked number one in the league 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.769
 extremes on a double boots and 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.829
 I was world champion at the 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.329
 new beetle him and me 2014 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.980
 today in partnership with thomas 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.600
 schaaf evokes the blow but neither France I 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.680
 offers you is the first pc is taken 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.390
 blocked votes sold by a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.250
 French assembly but this machine 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.199
 this panis of his status if I'm not going 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.150
 not carry my contribution and so for 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.129
 you and the profiles bios price established 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:58.269
 allowing to food the machine and to 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:58.689
 blow up this formula in the heart of 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.939
 system 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:05.560
 we will start with the motherboard 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:08.890
 msi the z 97th power this motherboard 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.110
 so is oriented overclocking with no 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.950
 bad little options we are 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.930
 very useful 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.090
 to name a few, the debug led 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100
 which tell you when the motherboard has 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.289
 a worry a startup problem and 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.509
 that's what it tells you so the component 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.700
 who is causing the problem that can 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.049
 be able a4 processor set for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 debug conveniently for the time the 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.689
 king a small part with buttons 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.479
 kind as pale they have grown little 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.280
 blisters restart the map of 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.409
 stop it so when we do not have 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.319
 housing for sdi xtreme reclocking 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.850
 it's really very useful 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.369
 another very interesting function for 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.470
 we double bios with a small 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.890
 switch located just under the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.079
 frame you have a worry you missed 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.299
 your flash to this bios or the bios and 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.780
 corrupted you just have to switch on the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.880
 second 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.069
 she then the map again 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.909
 functional you can restore the one 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.009
 who had a concern 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.539
 other interesting thing so the phases 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.119
 feeding the map m there 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.170
 believe me she is in number 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.780
 important enough to really 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.799
 spent everything you need 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.030
 no fear on the decor the things 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.430
 like that Ã  la carte to the mayor will cash 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.489
 one are plugged in and then you have for 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.470
 processor power the card 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.060
 the two connectors so a pipeline to 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 a cap in to power the processor 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.950
 and then the 26 films for 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.560
 conclude this loss homair so a 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.250
 core i7 series processor by intel 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.900
 the 47 90 because 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.270
 so processors with the sensor is 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 miss raid it's the processor 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.690
 currently the most upscale on 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.620
 this bag is so cadences and basic 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.440
 at 4 giga hertz 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.690
 but thanks to belonging to the celica 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:09.550
 you can lovers blocked with the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 coefficients of debris to the part 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.120
 turn display at messi so I 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.270
 chose the 970 gaming which has 4 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.100
 gigas of ram design dual slots with 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.600
 two big fans to evacuate 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.500
 the calories in an extreme silence and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.170
 then 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.570
 a 6 pin connector and then a 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.790
 usb connector for power then 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.200
 the stickers is pretty explicit when 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.060
 connect the map if the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.920
 fan turns no worries 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.720
 it's just to reduce the noise they get 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:53.990
 will start when that would be 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:56.580
 leaves the storage of this 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:02.380
 configuration was entrusted so 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:05.350
 om x100 a ssd disk of crucial in 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.530
 156 gigabyte capacity so there for for 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.840
 hbo software to store windows etc 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.040
 there is plenty to do level 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.200
 heavy memory storage 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.769
 now the must-have g.skill 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.280
 with sorting in six basic so 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.950
 2400 in box 10 so why what 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.230
 place is bound chips that are on the 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.090
 ream sticks are samsung chips that 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.580
 are by far the most successful 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.720
 when we want to get stuck so there is 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.160
 teams that are more qualified 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:44.010
 up there are no prices that will be 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:45.940
 more performing for the part 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.050
 processor cooling if you want 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.430
 be able to look and it must of course 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.270
 that it be kept at a temperature 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.550
 reasonable 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.550
 so we trust corsair 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.070
 with his all-in-one watercooling kit 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.930
 75 h 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.420
 which is equipped with a base of two 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.680
 fans of 120 mm so there level 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.990
 performance we should be pretty good 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:16.810
 and then we'll see what can not 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:19.060
 cooking level with its components for 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.570
 the feeding of all of all this 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.830
 equipment 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.000
 we trusted big wiotte with 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.020
 a 600 watt gold power supply 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.090
 energy efficiency level one is 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.580
 really not bad ink gold and then 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.120
 level stability of stability of 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.600
 tensions at puy 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.860
 supported 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.540
 we are really very good so there will be 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:49.260
 no worries even in case of their club 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:50.400
 ping muscular and then to finish because 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.670
 people like to see boxes 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.130
 unlike extreme erp offers the 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.530
 part so casing was entrusted 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.410
 also to corsair with the spectrum wa 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.020
 a white backlighted case that 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.320
 has usb 3 ports on the front 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.240
 and then who has a design enough we will not 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.270
 say radiative but nice enough for a 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.130
 overclocking configuration thanks for having 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.120
 followed this video with us and I you 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.500
 make an appointment in the second 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.240
 part for a little tutorial 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.240
 overclocking workouts this machine 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.740
