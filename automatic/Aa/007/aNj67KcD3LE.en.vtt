you'll be learning how to ride the BMX
with<00:00:17.850> me<00:00:19.580> in<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> video<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.180> will<00:00:21.270> announce

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
with me in this video here will announce

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.870 
with me in this video here will announce
to<00:00:21.570> jump<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> BMX<00:00:22.289> bike<00:00:25.250> ok<00:00:26.250> step<00:00:26.519> 1

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to jump on a BMX bike ok step 1

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939 
to jump on a BMX bike ok step 1
you're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> need<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.500> speed<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you're going to need in your speed to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
you're going to need in your speed to
get<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> run<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:30.080> attempted<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
get up the run that you're attempted to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.590 
get up the run that you're attempted to
jump<00:00:31.320> onto<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> top<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:34.070> now<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.670> advise<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
jump onto the top of now I do advise to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.470 
jump onto the top of now I do advise to
start<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> smaller<00:00:37.380> run<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
start on a smaller run just for this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
start on a smaller run just for this
purpose<00:00:39.719> we'll<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.050> using<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:41.010> run<00:00:41.160> behind

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
purpose we'll be using the run behind

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
purpose we'll be using the run behind
this<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.940> ya<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.989> enough<00:00:43.200> speed<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> get

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this so ya get enough speed just to get

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.170 
this so ya get enough speed just to get
on<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> top<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> run<00:00:44.670> before<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
on to the top of the run before you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
on to the top of the run before you
start<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> jump<00:00:47.750> ok<00:00:48.750> step<00:00:48.989> 2<00:00:49.370> you've<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
start to jump ok step 2 you've got the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
start to jump ok step 2 you've got the
speed<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> run<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> go

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
speed to get on the run so as you go

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.840 
speed to get on the run so as you go
through<00:00:52.410> um<00:00:52.590> you'll<00:00:52.770> feel<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.460> lip<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
through um you'll feel the lip of the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
through um you'll feel the lip of the
ramp<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:54.600> steep<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> ramp<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
ramp so that's how steep the ramp is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
ramp so that's how steep the ramp is
some<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.129> steeper<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.430> others<00:00:56.699> obviously

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
some are steeper than others obviously

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.990 
some are steeper than others obviously
steeper<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:58.140> speedy<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> up

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
steeper the are more speedy to get up

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.099 
steeper the are more speedy to get up
but<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> leave<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> room<00:01:00.690> you'll<00:01:00.899> feel

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
but as you leave the room you'll feel

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.579 
but as you leave the room you'll feel
the<00:01:01.260> ramp<00:01:01.410> kick<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.359> point<00:01:03.600> your

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the ramp kick here so at this point your

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.929 
the ramp kick here so at this point your
foot<00:01:04.739> into<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> bunny<00:01:05.220> hop<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> don't

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
foot into the bunny hop if you don't

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.240 
foot into the bunny hop if you don't
learn<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> video<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.250> these

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
learn to look at the video but these

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
learn to look at the video but these
it's<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> burning<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.360> before<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it's like the burning up before the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's like the burning up before the
ramps<00:01:10.049> doing<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> pulling<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:10.950> for

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
ramps doing a lot of the pulling up for

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
ramps doing a lot of the pulling up for
you<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> speed<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.409> up

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you so as you have the speed to get up

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
you so as you have the speed to get up
the<00:01:13.619> run<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.070> ramps<00:01:14.340> or<00:01:14.460> kicks<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the run the ramps or kicks you up so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
the run the ramps or kicks you up so
that's<00:01:15.360> doing<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> pulling<00:01:15.900> off<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's doing the pulling off and all you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.580 
that's doing the pulling off and all you
have<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.759> push<00:01:18.060> forward<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> level

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
have to do is push forward just to level

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
have to do is push forward just to level
the<00:01:19.650> bike<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> air<00:01:22.640> ok<00:01:23.640> step<00:01:23.909> 3<00:01:24.180> you're

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the bike out in the air ok step 3 you're

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
the bike out in the air ok step 3 you're
airborne<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> air<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
airborne now you're in the air so you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
airborne now you're in the air so you
can<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> adjust<00:01:28.200> slightly

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
can have time just to adjust slightly

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
can have time just to adjust slightly
you've<00:01:29.280> straightened<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> air<00:01:30.350> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you've straightened out in the air you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
you've straightened out in the air you
can<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.650> ready<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> London<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.880> know

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can get ready for the London so you know

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
can get ready for the London so you know
it<00:01:33.030> could<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.479> four<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.780> six<00:01:34.350> foot<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it could be two four or six foot in the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
it could be two four or six foot in the
air<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> higher<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.329> more

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
air so the higher you are the more

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
air so the higher you are the more
you've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> absorb<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> landing<00:01:37.650> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you've got to absorb the landing so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580 
you've got to absorb the landing so
again<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:39.479> legs<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> Springs<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
again using your legs of Springs and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
again using your legs of Springs and
I'll<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.040> arms<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> land<00:01:42.750> compress

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
I'll see your arms as you land compress

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
I'll see your arms as you land compress
fully<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.770> obviously<00:01:44.340> remember<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:45.119> your

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
fully down obviously remember where your

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
fully down obviously remember where your
limit<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.570> because<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.259> don't<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
limit is because you don't want to be
