00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.650
 eating well title the good video them 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm going to show some repetitions in the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.080
 which my partner plan as he found 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 some villages with some booties that all 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 we would like to find ourselves really are 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 two villages in which to booty to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 stealing gold is from one million to another is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.279
 of 1,200,000 and then trying to steal what 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.790
 more than can not here comes the attack not 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 it is concentrated there by the town hall 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 it simply concentrates to steal the gold 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 because it 's something or it's too much gold 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.350
 I've never been a village 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 with more than 700 thousand proclamations that I 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 do they are 600,000 gold and the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 necklace to one of a million is nothing 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 bad here I clean the area a bit so that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.260
 services can clean the same by 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.289
 back here drop the kings and if you're 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 risking there for 50% but says that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.100
 wants to steal 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 but the truth to whoever comes out 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 village would try to go for the gold if it is that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 you do not have the knots to the maximum if you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 you no longer exist gold as it has to be 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.620
 case of this subject who already has everything to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 no longer have to spend gold and 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.970
 because here he is accumulating 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 our players arrive and steal them 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 here I use a little more radio 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
 deviated from the king because it helped a lot 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 destroy that warehouse of those warehouses 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.520
 there are those that were there of gold and then 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 it will take almost all the loot to see 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 there are 150,000 more left here there is a mine and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.259
 trying with archers to steal it 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.030
 because as you mentioned if you get a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.470
 idea is trying to steal as much as you can 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 although to see if this pressure is a bit 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 more and you do not steal as much as you would like 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.280
 people the good case almost takes the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 million of this village but see a million 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.550
 the offered of this village and more the bonus 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 of champion that are 180,000 so easy 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.040
 reached one million gold in this attack 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.049
 let's go with the next village I will not be 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.119
 talking still has more gold has 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.179
 1,200,000 as I said I think it has 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.849
 all packed in the clan castle what 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.800
 which is also full and so goes with the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.080
 technique that I have told you with the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.819
 archer towers that are very corners or 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 that they do not have defenses that protect them 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.709
 You can destroy them with balloons 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 and you can save that whole area and the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.970
 left was all the empty area 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.099
 on the right side, because that's where the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.620
 balloons equal for a little elixir that 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.720
 it's not as much as gold and in this case 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 gold is what matters to us and then in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.220
 the mines there is also a lot so there 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.630
 to look at that and here equal try 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.180
 do that but there was already the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.390
 crossbow attacking but manages to destroy 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.700
 this tower of arks 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.010
 another thing we see that it is a town hall 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.040
 10 against a town hall 10 I did not know 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.930
 that this could be to 1,200,000 I knew that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
 a town hall level 7 could steal 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.440
 more or less that to a town hall to 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.940
 level 10 but but now see a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.500
 City Hall at level 10 against 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.560
 level 10 councils can rob you 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.240
 this and leave me in the comments how much 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.430
 they have stolen you have left villages 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.670
 so to me really did not tell them that 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.230
 maximum was 600,000 and then if you 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.030
 has left in villages and I would like 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.520
 know it to know how many more villages or 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.080
 there's less like that up here, I think there's 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.180
 enough because many no longer use the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.110
 gold for nothing and with these level 12 mines 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.730
 now gold is accumulating more 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.130
 returning a bit to the attack we see how 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.350
 here they throw a rage where is in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.360
 the area of ​​the town hall there is still going 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.709
 a bloodhound remains alive the replicas 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.760
 hard blogs will help a lot 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.340
 destroy the town hall 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.739
 here it goes to city councils 50 percent 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.560
 and the star of the town hall and without 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.180
 kings up village really if they were 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.970
 many glasses, you had hurt him 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.500
 little more but not here basically it 's in 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 focus today for all the resources go there 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.209
 still loose the kings has not finished 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.040
 the attack although the clan castle 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.920
 enemy then call attention to a little 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.989
 there is no longer to kill the barbarian king is going to 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.670
 reign that was out there will be taking 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.489
 some balloons are in the castle 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.379
 but it still poses now out 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.700
 attack basically and now it's not going to 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.459
 pass the queen because there are many 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.680
 defenses because this was basically what 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.209
 that I wanted to show you in the video a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.340
 village of a million I have always seen 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.410
 photos on facebook that come out but 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.539
 I had never seen the repetition of 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.340
 how they attacked one and then here I leave 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.010
 two so that they see that if in our 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.280
 villages and then if they are town councils level 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.560
 lower the forests in the end I hope that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.220
 you liked it and we'll see you until the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220
 next video
