gonna do an up for triangle photo and
with<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.329> step<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.559> decide<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> do

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with this step if you decide not to do

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.840 
with this step if you decide not to do
the<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.329> jump<00:00:36.600> punch<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.399> only<00:00:38.399> recommend

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the the jump punch I only recommend

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
the the jump punch I only recommend
putting<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.390> photo<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:40.079> only<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.010> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
putting that photo in only if you're an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
putting that photo in only if you're an
open<00:00:41.460> space<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.420> close<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.050> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
open space because up close if it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
open space because up close if it's
blocked<00:00:43.800> its<00:00:44.070> highly<00:00:45.000> punishable<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
blocked its highly punishable so like I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
blocked its highly punishable so like I
said<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> jump<00:00:47.579> punch<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
said if you don't do the jump punch and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.920 
said if you don't do the jump punch and
just<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> photo<00:00:49.730> just<00:00:50.730> don't<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> up

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just do the photo just don't do it up

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720 
just do the photo just don't do it up
close<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> that's<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> advanced

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
close and that's just for you advanced

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.010 
close and that's just for you advanced
players<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.510> what's<00:00:54.690> safe<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
players want to know what's safe and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.610 
players want to know what's safe and
what's<00:00:55.230> not

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
what's not

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
what's not
by<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.890> subhan<00:00:56.399> step<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.230> edit<00:00:58.230> -

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
by the way subhan step to edit -

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
by the way subhan step to edit -
triangle<00:00:59.309> fold<00:00:59.550> square<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.359> triangle

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
triangle fold square and then triangle

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
triangle fold square and then triangle
and<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> step<00:01:03.539> you're<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and so this is the step you're going to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
and so this is the step you're going to
want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> start<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> don't<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
want to start with if you don't do the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
want to start with if you don't do the
up<00:01:05.640> forward<00:01:06.090> triangle<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:07.979> just

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
up forward triangle and if you're just

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
up forward triangle and if you're just
going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> start<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.670> close<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
going to start it up close because this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
going to start it up close because this
string<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.290> its<00:01:10.439> own<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.250> safe<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
string in its own is really safe on

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
string in its own is really safe on
block<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> said<00:01:14.040> let's<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that's what should look like and let's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.109 
that's what should look like and let's
move<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.790> step<00:01:24.030> three<00:01:24.330> add<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.990> -<00:01:25.380> oh<00:01:25.740> oh<00:01:26.549> which

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
move on step three add in - oh oh which

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.620 
move on step three add in - oh oh which
is<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> double<00:01:27.720> kick<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> yeah<00:01:30.360> that's

is that double kick and so yeah that's
what<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> controller<00:01:31.829> should<00:01:32.400> look

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
what what on the controller should look

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.120 
what what on the controller should look
like<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> said<00:01:34.560> before<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like this and like I said before this is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880 
like this and like I said before this is
really<00:01:35.159> easy<00:01:35.670> combo<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.619> really

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
really easy combo to do and it's really

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
Johnny cages bread-and-butter

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.039 
Johnny cages bread-and-butter
mid<00:01:40.500> screen<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> yeah<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:45.049> then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
mid screen so yeah there it is and then

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
mid screen so yeah there it is and then

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
with Johnny Cage combos is that they go

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
with Johnny Cage combos is that they go
far<00:01:53.579> screen<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.630> I'll<00:01:54.750> explain<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.170> after

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
far screen but I'll explain that after

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
far screen but I'll explain that after
