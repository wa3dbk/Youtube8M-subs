importantly what you have here on the
steering<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.210> lot<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.960> stuff<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.650> this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
steering is a lot of stuff so it this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.920 
steering is a lot of stuff so it this
just<00:01:55.400> takes<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.150> little<00:01:56.300> while<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.720> kind<00:01:56.810> of
