it's<00:00:14.200> a<00:00:14.230> big<00:00:14.380> misconception<00:00:14.650> that<00:00:15.250> you<00:00:15.760> have

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
it's a big misconception that you have

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.070 
it's a big misconception that you have
to<00:00:15.969> have<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.090> hundred<00:00:16.240> watts<00:00:16.510> to<00:00:16.720> play<00:00:16.900> in<00:00:17.020> a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
to have a hundred watts to play in a

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.510 
to have a hundred watts to play in a
small<00:00:17.350> club<00:00:17.619> like<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.890> size<00:00:18.100> of<00:00:18.189> this<00:00:18.250> room

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
small club like the size of this room

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.339 
small club like the size of this room
that's<00:00:19.000> just<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.390> worst<00:00:19.570> idea<00:00:19.930> ever<00:00:19.990> so<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
that's just the worst idea ever so the

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.210 
that's just the worst idea ever so the
50<00:00:20.619> watts<00:00:20.830> which<00:00:21.070> is<00:00:21.390> noticeably<00:00:22.390> awesome<00:00:22.840> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
50 watts which is noticeably awesome and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.470 
50 watts which is noticeably awesome and
where<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.250> lot<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.460> other<00:00:24.610> companies<00:00:24.970> failed<00:00:25.300> is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
where a lot of other companies failed is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.390 
where a lot of other companies failed is
that<00:00:25.660> they<00:00:25.779> have<00:00:25.960> like<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.230> switch<00:00:26.950> that<00:00:26.980> cuts

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
that they have like a switch that cuts

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.850 
that they have like a switch that cuts
the<00:00:27.490> wattage<00:00:28.119> but<00:00:28.960> there's<00:00:29.140> no<00:00:29.349> real<00:00:29.649> way<00:00:29.829> to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
the wattage but there's no real way to

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.530 
the wattage but there's no real way to
fine<00:00:30.220> tune<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.520> way<00:00:30.759> that<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.000> actually<00:00:31.119> feels

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
fine tune the way that it actually feels

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.299 
fine tune the way that it actually feels
and<00:00:31.750> that's<00:00:31.869> what<00:00:32.020> that<00:00:32.110> depth<00:00:32.410> knob<00:00:32.649> really

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
and that's what that depth knob really

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.460 
and that's what that depth knob really
comes<00:00:33.579> into<00:00:33.790> play<00:00:34.239> because<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:35.170> can<00:00:35.320> really

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
comes into play because you can really

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.780 
comes into play because you can really
fine-tune<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.219> if<00:00:36.309> you<00:00:36.430> get<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.579> lower

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
fine-tune it so if you get a lower

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.150 
fine-tune it so if you get a lower
volume<00:00:37.180> and<00:00:38.020> you<00:00:38.110> cut<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.469> wattage<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.950> can

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
volume and you cut the wattage you can

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:52.470 
volume and you cut the wattage you can
push<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.579> cap<00:00:39.760> or<00:00:40.030> by<00:00:40.300> using<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.690> steps

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's simple its two channels you don't

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.030 
it's simple its two channels you don't
have<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.299> have<00:01:23.479> like<00:01:23.509> four<00:01:24.500> channels<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:24.950> you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
have to have like four channels if you

have to have like four channels if you
get<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.250> right<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.430> first<00:01:25.670> time<00:01:25.850> because<00:01:26.299> at

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
get it right the first time because at

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.840 
get it right the first time because at
the<00:01:26.630> end<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.840> day<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:27.680> got<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.549> much<00:01:28.640> more

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
settings for this amp are to pull up a

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.990 
settings for this amp are to pull up a
clock<00:01:36.829> all<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.070> way<00:01:37.159> across<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.549> board<00:01:37.789> and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
clock all the way across the board and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.399 
clock all the way across the board and
then<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.780> turned<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> volume<00:01:39.170> up

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
then I just I just turned the volume up

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.429 
then I just I just turned the volume up
and<00:01:39.530> down<00:01:39.560> accordingly<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:41.210> that's<00:01:41.439> most

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
and down accordingly and that's most

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.130 
and down accordingly and that's most
amps<00:01:42.770> I'd<00:01:42.860> do<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.220> as<00:01:43.429> a<00:01:43.460> starting<00:01:43.939> point

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
amps I'd do that as a starting point

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.600 
amps I'd do that as a starting point
this<00:01:45.140> amp<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.770> put<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.189> all<00:01:46.280> on<00:01:46.399> twelve

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
this amp I just put it all on twelve

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.340 
this amp I just put it all on twelve
o'clock<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.000> that's<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:52.899> thing<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:54.080> silly

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
o'clock and that's that thing is silly

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.550 
o'clock and that's that thing is silly

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
silly good you know it's a cool amp and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.930 
silly good you know it's a cool amp and
it<00:01:57.770> seems<00:01:57.979> like<00:01:58.130> everybody's<00:01:58.490> got<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.789> right
