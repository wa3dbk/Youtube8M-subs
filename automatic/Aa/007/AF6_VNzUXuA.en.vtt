00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
hi I'm Jenny C and I'm here to talk to

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.750 
hi I'm Jenny C and I'm here to talk to
you<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.840> the<00:00:07.319> prognosis<00:00:07.920> or<00:00:08.280> expected

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
you about the prognosis or expected

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.780 
you about the prognosis or expected
outcome<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.299> people<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:09.719> schizophrenia

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
outcome for people with schizophrenia

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.119 
outcome for people with schizophrenia
the<00:00:11.790> prognosis<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.750> very<00:00:12.840> variable<00:00:13.619> and<00:00:14.010> so

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
the prognosis is very variable and so

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.769 
the prognosis is very variable and so
some<00:00:14.309> people<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.730> very<00:00:14.879> well<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.299> some<00:00:15.480> people

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779 
some people do very well and some people

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.950 
some people do very well and some people
do<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.279> well<00:00:17.480> we<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.660> from<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
do not do so well we know from the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.689 
do not do so well we know from the
international<00:00:19.710> study<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.160> schizophrenia

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
international study of schizophrenia

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.609 
international study of schizophrenia
that<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.359> least<00:00:21.630> half<00:00:21.929> of<00:00:22.080> people<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.589> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that at least half of people have a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
that at least half of people have a
favorable<00:00:23.250> outcome<00:00:23.339> over<00:00:23.820> time<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
favorable outcome over time which is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
favorable outcome over time which is
very<00:00:24.810> encouraging<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.439> people<00:00:25.769> who<00:00:26.189> are

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
very encouraging for people who are

if<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.320> suddenly<00:00:56.100> develop<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
if you suddenly develop a lot of

if you suddenly develop a lot of
paranoia<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.650> or<00:00:59.520> hallucinations<00:01:00.330> all<00:01:00.570> at

paranoia and or hallucinations all at

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.220 
paranoia and or hallucinations all at
once

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
once

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
once
that's<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.860> sign<00:01:02.490> for<00:01:02.760> better

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that's actually a sign for better

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
that's actually a sign for better
prognosis<00:01:03.720> in<00:01:04.049> schizophrenia<00:01:04.259> so<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
prognosis in schizophrenia so some of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.450 
prognosis in schizophrenia so some of
the<00:01:05.640> strengths<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.509> protective<00:01:07.049> in

the strengths that can be protective in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.200 
the strengths that can be protective in
for<00:01:08.460> people<00:01:08.579> who<00:01:08.789> have<00:01:08.999> schizophrenia

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
for people who have schizophrenia

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.770 
for people who have schizophrenia
include<00:01:10.399> having<00:01:11.399> good<00:01:11.820> pre<00:01:12.179> what<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> call

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
include having good pre what we call

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
include having good pre what we call
premorbid<00:01:13.229> functioning<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.979> before<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.299> were

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
premorbid functioning so before you were

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.630 
premorbid functioning so before you were
ill<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:16.499> you<00:01:16.859> were<00:01:17.460> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.759> work<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.689> had

you have a higher IQ those kinds of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.809 
you have a higher IQ those kinds of
things<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.200> protective<00:01:25.770> having<00:01:26.670> a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
developing countries and what we what we

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
developing countries and what we what we
know<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> increased<00:02:01.740> mortality<00:02:01.920> isn't

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
know is that increased mortality isn't

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.879 
know is that increased mortality isn't
due<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.119> mean<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.289> media<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.740> would

due to I mean from the media we would

due to I mean from the media we would
