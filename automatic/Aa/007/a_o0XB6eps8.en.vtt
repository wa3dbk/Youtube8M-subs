00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi to all and welcome to a little 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.880
 commented gameplay on fuji tv on 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 hitman the chinese new year level 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 So there your mission it will be simple this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 will be killed three targets I advise you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 to be in disguise of policemen for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 to do well this is the most 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.980
 simple to go unnoticed because it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.689
 there are not many police officers in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 city and above all there is a lot of crowd 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 so it's very easy for you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.099
 hide if you were a conservator 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 Chinese would be well binding 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.519
 because there are so many 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 so here if I do not go here it's 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.000
 for a very simple little trick 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.070
 knows that our targets want some 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 information about birdie and that has 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 corrupt police officers who hold 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.809
 news 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 finally the police file had 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.270
 bordered and I will come and tell me about 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.620
 This folder 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 he's here up feel that guys do not me 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.809
 see it's very important and I'm 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 just go for why I did 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 that one of the three sites will come to get 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 his record seeing that he disappeared there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.909
 is going to be a little confrontation 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.909
 between the policeman targeted me and the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.540
 policeman feeling threatened is going to take out his 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.909
 weapon and simply kill our target 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.110
 so it's super simple you do not even 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.880
 not get your hands dirty is someone 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.340
 who will do it for you we see that I 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 pass in front of death to rats 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.140
 I'll go get it for you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 to show the rat poison that must serve 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 surely poisoned food 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 in one of the routines from possible to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.909
 you follow them and watch me well 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 I have not done it yet I do not know that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.700
 corresponds to which of my 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 targets but I will redo the level 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.149
 once to try to find out who 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 it can correspond so there you see 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.659
 katana a katana is a challenge in 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 done if you kill your three targets with 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.540
 the katana you 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 or release a challenge it's very easy 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 because they come to isolate themselves especially 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 here there are two of the three targets that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.250
 just isolated here and the third 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 was still isolated there in the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 background so is really easy to kill 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.330
 it's the last one I'll kill if not 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.590
 there was also the possible accident 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.550
 mine of your targets happening or the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.709
 trolley here but that implies that a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.540
 innocent will kill and I do not want a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.870
 innocent will kill us finally that a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 innocent be killed by no and that's for 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.920
 that's pretty that's why I 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.299
 will take me this way there I 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.769
 wanted to take a bottle for a 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.720
 distraction later but I got 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.420
 remembered that I had the katana and I had 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.090
 want to keep canada I you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.769
 always advise of when you are a 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.269
 purist and you know more he of your 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.830
 targets is eliminated in see them in the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.620
 menu that's what I'm going to do to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 the moment I just watched too but 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.080
 this guy are dead when a little 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.140
 arrow in it means it's the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.610
 case that was not the case 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.110
 as I was a bit inattentive by 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.299
 moments I wanted to check to be 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 sure that she is not already dead 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.709
 and in fact it's going to be the case now 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:09.090
 hop see bill doyle eliminated city 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.560
 very nice dialogues we him 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.950
 ask what does it mean what it evokes 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.640
 the name birdie for him answered 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.910
 grilled chickens 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.769
 it was not the right answer it was 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.880
 well tried anyway that's if he was 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.700
 gone to questions for a champion he 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.910
 would be more likely so that's the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.250
 target being innocent fan the seller 1900 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.389
 is in progress will say we locate our site 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.799
 without being spotted and in addition we 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.540
 save the life that releases a challenge too 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.970
 so here there is one of the cops who does 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.970
 a boring annuity 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.270
 I just put water to be able to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.270
 the dodged and hidden in the hop crowd 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.800
 it's gone I can go there you have 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.220
 saw I do speed run version does not lose 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.170
 of time finally I lose a minimum of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.360
 time here I advise you to good 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.350
 eat walls and you two of you 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.790
 squat the up 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.090
 like that you are neither seen nor known by 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.320
 the policemen who all say here there are 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 the seller also that is produced 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.960
 normally there was not dreaming yet 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000
 because I had not trigger his 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.020
 script but I already tried I believe 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 that it's hot to go before he 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.490
 happens to throw you over the wall a 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 object to distract them both 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.239
 which allows you to go through the hole 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.140
 to wall and our last targets and 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.980
 there if you read in the information 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.470
 about your targets we teach you 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.020
 that he is a great smoker and who says 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.460
 matte meaning what says bad house 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.390
 everyone knows it except the target 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.770
 apparently you are waiting for everything 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.140
 simply that his mobile phone is ringing and that they 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 are recovering a little profile for 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.420
 able to go through and traffic the pump to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.790
 gasoline 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.530
 in general when your targets when when 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.720
 the judges the level characters are 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.100
 on the phone they are much less 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.930
 attentive to their environment 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.760
 so that allows you to spend more 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.900
 easily there is a mass if you 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.370
 want to make a distraction if you 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.990
 want to have all the objects of the levels 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.100
 but it's not necessarily necessary 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.490
 because if you wait for them to 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.940
 return 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.960
 you can go quietly then 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.880
 this is the exit door 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.650
 just wait for the third 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.590
 target crushes his cigarette in the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.950
 sources for being able to be able to be 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.420
 dead woman 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.780
 besides, there were fire attacks 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.950
 you are warned you are 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.480
 savvy franco ounce is eliminated one can 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.980
 to leave the level thank you for having 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.670
 viewed this solution and see you soon 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.670
