 per week then usually on Sunday 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.920
 beauty where I do feel I have to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 Hair I go, make a mask on my 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.450
 I will first show that using shampoo 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.969
 I'm using this here da l'oreéal 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.879
 lately producers are da l'oreéal 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.920
 more functional producer and actor being 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 very good, I'm really liking it and here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 England cheaper than buying the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.440
 I know that Brazil is expensive but in Brazil. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.059
 time in england is not expensive so I 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 I think of a normal game so it's worth 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.560
 Worth to buy there then use memorial 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 paris resp such it is going for shampoo 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.439
 Collor who is emotional so he is 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.630
 It is basically the moisturizer with a floor and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.299
 a shampoo that moisturizes just to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 hair that has been dyed has had an impact 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.210
 that in the case of mine and my mother, right? 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.250
 and it's very good he leaves his hair still 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.079
 but my hair is proud but here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 for a dry time he does not get curious 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.939
 so he leaves his hair smelling 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.780
 very good full of tasty p 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.600
 is he very good and leaves the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 super clean and scented nest hair 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.159
 If you feel hydrated you feel 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.490
 moisturized plus nothing very curious and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.869
 conditioner 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 Kind as if the pain is very good and July 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.200
 Damn his hair and he too. 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.810
 It was good, the hair is super easy to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.090
 combing and giving a shine know gives a shine 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.430
 very pretty in my hair so I use this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.209
 What da l'oreéal I like a lot 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.430

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.380
 I use the 0 scoreboard that yes I like 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.180

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.870
 time 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 finally you have to use the dry shampoo and it is 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.360
 very common that there is a volume of the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.400
 hair 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.799
 I'm using both the great so I 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 I have the battisti who is the one who is 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.299

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.640
 really good of battisti 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.560
 But what my mother has is what she had. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.480
 with a little paint and then came 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.170

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.849

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.060
