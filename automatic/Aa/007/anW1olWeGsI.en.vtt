00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.580
 in this video we are going to apply a change 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.470
 of plane so that the plane of this plane 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.710
 public that we have represented by their 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:14.499
 traces that project t to one of the 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.630
 projection planes in this case I'm going to 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.640
 make it project vertical t by 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.160
 So what I 'm going to have to do is 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.000
 look for a land line that is 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.340
 perpendicular to the horizontal trace of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.070
 flat 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.230
 I'm going to for example over here 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 you are on my land line I am going to place 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.309
 the plane totally reversed because 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.890
 It will be a usual procedure 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.080
 we will use to find some sections 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.379
 We have the line of solids 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.960
 ground fully rotated the precision 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.360
 vertical would be here here we have 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.320
 named the new land line as 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.940
 1h unlike the two cases 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 previous ones that we saw in other videos of 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.470
 how to locate the new trace of a 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 flat when we make a plane change 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.509
 we saw a case where we were looking for a 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.140
 horizontal line to use a point 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.509
 located and move that elevation or 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.000
 We were looking for the cut point of the 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.310
 land lines and there we would take a 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 point in this case as the result that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.110
 let's get it is a plane project t 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 in this case they project vertical t that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.310
 vertical trace will contain all the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.040
 points of the plane 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.159
 this means that it is enough for us to take 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.290
 any point of the plane in its two 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.259
 projections so we can take 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.149
 a point of the plane's own trace 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.149
 imagine the lame this point 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.950
 which is in the plane vertical trace 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.290
 here we will have its vertical precision and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.490
 here its horizontal precision for this 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.710
 point that we have it in the trace 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 vertical plane will serve us for 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.330
 find the new vertical trace placed 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760
 that is going to be a trace project is going to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.740
 contain all the points of the plane not 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.990
 we have to worry about nothing else 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.240
 we just take the squadron in 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.620
 perpendicular to the new land line 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.460
 A line 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.490
 that serves as a line of reference and 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.370
 we use the compass to measure the height 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.740
 we adjust to take the height and we the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.740
 We take to the new land line 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.910
 here we will have the point v in your new 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 vertical projection except we have not 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.150
 had to worry about placing this 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.040
 point on any line since 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 we know that the trace itself contains 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.370
 all the points of the plane we have the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.060
 cut point of the trace we have the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.390
 point we can draw that trace of the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.390
 flat 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.740
 this would be the new vertical trace of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.030
 plane that we will call p 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.000
 premium 1 and the problem is already solved 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.710
 as we said we have converted a plane 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.660
 public on a plane for the moment 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.800
 vertical this is a procedure that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.530
 we will use with enough assiduity to 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.510
 locate flat sections in figure 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.190
 polyhedral 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.410
 Well, we always hope that the video 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 you find it useful to see you in a 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.010
 next video
