00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
like as you can see the makeup is

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.980 
like as you can see the makeup is
already<00:02:20.600> coming<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> sponge<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.990> then

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
already coming out of the sponge so then

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
already coming out of the sponge so then
I<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.350> set<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:25.280> bars<00:02:25.490> up<00:02:25.700> over<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> side

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
and then I just take the sponge and just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.750 
and then I just take the sponge and just
kind<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.750> work<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.560> soap<00:02:30.890> into<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.460> sponge

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
kind of work the soap into the sponge

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.250

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.930 
with my hands and like as you can see
the<00:02:36.470> sponge<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.920> already<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.610> starting<00:02:37.910> to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
the sponge is already really starting to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.440 
the sponge is already really starting to
come<00:02:38.600> clean<00:02:38.960> so<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.670> put<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.940> back<00:02:40.970> under

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
come clean so then I put it back under

come clean so then I put it back under
the<00:02:41.570> water<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.720> worth<00:02:45.050> water

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
the water and just really worth water

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.560 
the water and just really worth water
into<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.920> sponge<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.430> kind<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.970> squeezing

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
into the sponge just kind of squeezing

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.240 
into the sponge just kind of squeezing
it<00:02:47.840> oops

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
it oops

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.880 
it oops
to<00:02:49.700> really<00:02:49.880> get<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.330> soak<00:02:50.720> up<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.080> water<00:02:51.290> so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
to really get it to soak up the water so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.770 
to really get it to soak up the water so
it<00:02:51.980> will<00:02:52.100> clean<00:02:52.400> out<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.240> soap<00:02:53.510> from<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
it will clean out all the soap from the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.390 
it will clean out all the soap from the
sponge<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.620> might<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.220> this

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
sponge and you might have to do this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
sponge and you might have to do this
process<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.090> couple<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.510> times<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.959> your<00:02:57.110> sponge

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
process a couple of times if your sponge

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.160 
process a couple of times if your sponge
is<00:02:57.590> really<00:02:58.160> dirty<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.760> mine<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.720> get<00:02:59.870> all<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
is really dirty like mine to get all the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.080 
is really dirty like mine to get all the
foundation<00:03:00.650> out<00:03:00.770> but<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.880> see

foundation out but like as you can see

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.640 
foundation out but like as you can see
like<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.900> majority<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.410> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
like it got the majority of the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.970 
like it got the majority of the
foundation<00:03:04.130> out<00:03:04.310> already<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.900> just<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.800> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
foundation out already so just do the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.949 
foundation out already so just do the
whole<00:03:07.010> process<00:03:07.670> over<00:03:07.880> again<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.540> I'll<00:03:08.660> just

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
whole process over again so I'll just

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.250 
whole process over again so I'll just

then<00:03:22.790> I'll<00:03:23.510> get<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.870> sponge<00:03:24.050> wet<00:03:24.380> again<00:03:24.530> and

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
then I'll get the sponge wet again and

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.120 
then I'll get the sponge wet again and
just<00:03:26.269> kind<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.690> work<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.140> soap<00:03:27.560> into<00:03:27.890> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
like this to like work that foundation

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:46.220 
like this to like work that foundation
out<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.050> sponge

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.750 

and<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.349> know<00:03:47.500> like<00:03:47.739> sometimes<00:03:48.220> your<00:03:48.489> makeup

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
and you know like sometimes your makeup

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370 
and you know like sometimes your makeup
sponge<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.209> just<00:03:49.390> going<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.630> get<00:03:49.750> stained<00:03:50.110> with

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
sponge is just going to get stained with

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.710 
sponge is just going to get stained with
the<00:03:50.500> foundation<00:03:51.099> like<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.940> could<00:03:52.120> be<00:03:52.270> clean

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the foundation like it could be clean

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.430 
the foundation like it could be clean
but<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.890> funds<00:03:54.220> may<00:03:54.489> be<00:03:54.520> stained<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.440> I

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
but the funds may be stained like I

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.900 
but the funds may be stained like I
think<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.860> sponge<00:03:57.190> might<00:03:57.430> be<00:03:57.580> like<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.880> little

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
think this sponge might be like a little

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.850 
think this sponge might be like a little
chained<00:03:58.450> right<00:03:58.810> here<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.349> right<00:03:59.440> down<00:03:59.709> the

chained right here and right down the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.920 
chained right here and right down the
tip<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.730> way<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:01.209> tell<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.630> got<00:04:01.780> all
