00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that happens falls in between the fall

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.900 
that happens falls in between the fall
board<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.160> lands<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> back<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
board it actually lands on the back of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
board it actually lands on the back of
the<00:00:32.969> keys<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:34.710> of

the keys there right there I'm kind of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
the keys there right there I'm kind of
testing<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.059> hear

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
testing to see if you can actually hear

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
testing to see if you can actually hear
it<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.200> case<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> can't<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.070> usually

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it in that case you can't but usually

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.200 
it in that case you can't but usually
you<00:00:38.820> can't<00:00:39.059> hear<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> clicking<00:00:39.510> around<00:00:41.210> so

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you can't hear it clicking around so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.430 
you can't hear it clicking around so
