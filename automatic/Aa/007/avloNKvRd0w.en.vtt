00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.810 
away and the curling technique that I
use<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:13.650> hair<00:03:13.860> does<00:03:14.040> not<00:03:14.070> curl<00:03:14.580> well

is<00:03:15.709> starting<00:03:16.709> at<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.830> root<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:18.350> curling

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
is starting at the root and then curling

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.460 
is starting at the root and then curling
down<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> careful<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.260> your

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
then you're just going to continue to do

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.770 
then you're just going to continue to do
that<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.410> it's<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.800> take<00:03:32.360> not<00:03:33.360> as<00:03:33.570> long

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that and it's going to take not as long

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
that and it's going to take not as long
as<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.170> normally<00:03:34.350> would<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> curl<00:03:35.010> your<00:03:35.100> hair

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
because you've got half of it cover it

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.949 
because you've got half of it cover it
up<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.580> beanie<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:40.580> as<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:42.690> I

up with your beanie so as you can see I

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.310 
up with your beanie so as you can see I
just<00:03:43.160> start<00:03:44.160> closest<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.270> root<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.750> hold<00:03:46.200> it

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
just start closest to the root I hold it

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.720 
just start closest to the root I hold it
for<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.620> bit<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.010> then<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.190> relief<00:03:47.489> and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
for a little bit and then I relief and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.440 
for a little bit and then I relief and
twist<00:03:48.209> back<00:03:48.450> up<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.610> for<00:03:50.610> some<00:03:50.850> reason<00:03:50.880> my

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
twist back up and for some reason my

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.270 
twist back up and for some reason my
hair<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.720> holds<00:03:52.290> crow<00:03:52.500> better<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.070> I

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
hair just holds crow better like this I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.110 
hair just holds crow better like this I
don't<00:03:53.489> even<00:03:53.610> know<00:03:54.410> why<00:03:55.410> exactly<00:03:55.920> what<00:03:56.670> what<00:03:57.000> it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
don't even know why exactly what what it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.210 
don't even know why exactly what what it
is<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.510> makes<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.890> work<00:03:58.890> better<00:03:59.100> but<00:04:01.220> and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
is that makes it work better but and

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.780 
is that makes it work better but and
then<00:04:02.519> relief<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.190> think<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.610> gist

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
then relief so I think you get the gist

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.120 
then relief so I think you get the gist
of<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.450> i<00:04:06.480> will<00:04:06.959> show<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.320> when<00:04:07.680> i<00:04:07.709> get<00:04:07.980> to
