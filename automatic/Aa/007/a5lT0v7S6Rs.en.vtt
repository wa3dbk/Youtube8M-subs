00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.180
 gp day 2 of the dakar rally 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.829
 how did it go today well i must say 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.899
 we drove a super today 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.460
 and if I have is nice because it 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.960
 book i will say it was tough 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.809
 because in the beginning they are the min 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.500
 that are so in that tough team but still 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.500
 turned out to be tough 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.470
 we are just starting this search for one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.330
 waypoint 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 it just a few minutes I took him 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.159
 still has 5 6 Jah6 than 25 minutes 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.900
 lost in itself gives every first 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.420
 problems laugh out 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.920
 then nice tire driven so tires 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 swapped the nuts it didn't go well 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 walk so we have something 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.790
 trouble spots there goes six seven eight 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.790
 minutes lost 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.509
 No 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.110
 I have to say we have super 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 driven we are pretty good time 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.740
 we have 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.930
 well so well learned and we are full 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.530
