00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
step one is going to be in separating

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.160 
step one is going to be in separating
the<00:00:34.309> same<00:00:34.550> from<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.850> countertop<00:00:35.630> by<00:00:35.840> scraping

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
the same from the countertop by scraping

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.459 
the same from the countertop by scraping
away<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:37.280> seal<00:00:37.640> with<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:38.180> chisel<00:00:38.630> that's

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
away the seal with the chisel that's

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.639 
away the seal with the chisel that's
currently<00:00:39.829> what<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:40.250> cold<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:42.290> can<00:00:42.440> lift

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
currently what it's cold so we can lift

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.130 
currently what it's cold so we can lift
up<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.010> same<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.579> take<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:43.969> out<00:00:46.660> now<00:00:47.660> once

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
up the same and take it out now once

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.080 
up the same and take it out now once
we're<00:00:48.379> done<00:00:48.500> with<00:00:48.559> that<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.550> sink<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
we're done with that in the sink and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.529 
we're done with that in the sink and
freely<00:00:54.100> now<00:00:55.100> we're<00:00:55.399> disconnecting<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.239> sewer

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
freely now we're disconnecting the sewer

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.170 
freely now we're disconnecting the sewer
lines<00:00:57.160> by<00:00:58.160> twisting<00:00:59.000> us<00:00:59.829> seems<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.010> be<00:01:01.129> not<00:01:02.000> an

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
lines by twisting us seems to be not an

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:11.609 
lines by twisting us seems to be not an
easy<00:01:02.300> task<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.050> I'm<00:01:03.199> right<00:01:03.739> oh<00:01:05.859> there<00:01:06.859> it<00:01:06.979> goes

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.919 

that's<00:01:12.619> one<00:01:12.859> of<00:01:13.069> them<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.779> other

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
that's one of them and this is the other

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:24.890 
that's one of them and this is the other
one<00:01:15.109> right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.690 

now<00:01:25.900> we<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.260> disconnect<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.220> garbage

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
now we have to disconnect the garbage

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
now we have to disconnect the garbage
disposal

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.899 

so<00:01:38.860> now<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.070> we've<00:01:39.490> disconnected

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
so now that we've disconnected

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.730 
so now that we've disconnected
everything<00:01:40.479> we<00:01:40.690> removed<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.350> garbage

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
everything we removed the garbage

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
everything we removed the garbage
disposal<00:01:42.370> we<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.570> put<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.840> aside<00:01:43.960> for<00:01:44.140> now

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
disposal we can I put it aside for now

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.520 
disposal we can I put it aside for now
so<00:01:45.760> now<00:01:46.090> we're<00:01:46.270> almost<00:01:46.390> ready<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:47.050> take<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
so now we're almost ready to take this a

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.560 
so now we're almost ready to take this a
cab<00:01:47.740> we've<00:01:47.950> disconnected<00:01:48.400> although<00:01:48.970> water

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
cab we've disconnected although water

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.960 
cab we've disconnected although water
supplies<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.710> what's<00:01:51.369> going<00:01:51.520> up<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.880> the

supplies that what's going up to the
sink<00:01:52.210> there's<00:01:52.479> apparently<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.170> little<00:01:53.590> problem

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
sink but we're almost ready to take it

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.390 
sink but we're almost ready to take it
out<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.180> put<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.479> new<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.710> moving<00:02:06.250> on

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
out and put the new one in so moving on

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.430 
out and put the new one in so moving on
to<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.610> next<00:02:06.700> step<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.539> we<00:02:07.660> can't<00:02:07.899> just<00:02:08.020> put

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
to the next step but we can't just put

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.650 
to the next step but we can't just put
the<00:02:08.560> new<00:02:08.739> sink<00:02:09.039> on<00:02:09.220> top<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.820> old<00:02:10.119> stuff

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
the new sink on top of the old stuff

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.780 
the new sink on top of the old stuff
that<00:02:10.720> was<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.230> here<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:11.650> have<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:12.010> prove<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
that was on here we have to prove the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.660 
that was on here we have to prove the
remainder<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> seal<00:02:13.959> Latino<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> go

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
remainder of the seal Latino can it go

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.050 
remainder of the seal Latino can it go
slow<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:17.130> i'll<00:02:18.130> probably<00:02:18.430> take<00:02:18.670> some<00:02:18.850> help

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
slow but i'll probably take some help

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.509 
slow but i'll probably take some help
later<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:25.440> we're<00:02:26.440> ready<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.769> put<00:02:27.070> on<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.250> new

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
later on we're ready to put on the new

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.670 
later on we're ready to put on the new
sink<00:02:27.880> everything's<00:02:28.420> taken<00:02:28.630> out<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.530> first

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
sink everything's taken out so the first

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.740 
sink everything's taken out so the first
step<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.010> take<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.400> out<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> box<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.540> got<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
step is take it out of the box we got a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.630 
step is take it out of the box we got a
pretty<00:02:32.050> new<00:02:32.430> stainless<00:02:33.430> steel<00:02:36.930> possible<00:02:38.640> I'm

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
pretty new stainless steel possible I'm

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty new stainless steel possible I'm
going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.880> put<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.850> works

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.790 

this<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.630> much<00:02:49.900> lighter<00:02:50.200> than<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.710> other<00:02:50.830> one

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.560 

so<00:02:56.800> now<00:02:56.950> we're<00:02:57.130> tightening<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.880> fixtures<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
so now we're tightening the fixtures to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.270 
so now we're tightening the fixtures to
the<00:02:58.690> new<00:02:58.840> sink<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.530> we're<00:02:59.800> about<00:02:59.860> ready<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the new sink and we're about ready to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:18.810 
the new sink and we're about ready to
put<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:15.240> there<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.520> last<00:03:18.640> step

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
put it on there it is so the last step

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.580 
put it on there it is so the last step
is<00:03:19.270> connecting<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> water<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.440> new

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
is connecting the water to the new

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.040 
is connecting the water to the new
fixtures<00:03:21.100> but<00:03:21.490> this<00:03:21.820> would<00:03:22.060> be<00:03:22.240> way<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.930> my

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
fixtures but this would be way out of my

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.570 
fixtures but this would be way out of my
comfort<00:03:23.080> zone<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.830> think<00:03:23.950> I'm<00:03:24.280> done<00:03:24.430> with

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
comfort zone so I think I'm done with

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.340 
comfort zone so I think I'm done with
this<00:03:24.640> project<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.420> I've<00:03:25.690> done<00:03:26.050> pretty<00:03:26.200> well

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
this project and I've done pretty well

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.140

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
which he considers fun so I thought I

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
which he considers fun so I thought I

was as much out of my comfort zone as

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.490 
was as much out of my comfort zone as
you<00:04:40.990> can<00:04:41.169> compare<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.830> man

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
you can compare to a man

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.910
