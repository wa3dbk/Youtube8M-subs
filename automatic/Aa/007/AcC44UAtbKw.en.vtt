editor to find and pick up the fifth key

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.070 
editor to find and pick up the fifth key
in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.650> fusion<00:00:25.920> world<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.930> see

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
in the fusion world so as you can see

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
in the fusion world so as you can see
I'm<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.619> track<00:00:29.429> editor<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:31.880> have<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I'm in the track editor now and I have a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
I'm in the track editor now and I have a
feeling<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.540> got<00:00:33.840> something<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.770> with

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
feeling it's got something to do with

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.750 
feeling it's got something to do with
this<00:00:35.160> career<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:36.350> there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.730> been<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this career because there's a been a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.180 
this career because there's a been a
couple<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.300> references<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> actual

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
couple of references in the actual

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.970 
couple of references in the actual
career<00:00:41.520> mode<00:00:42.079> saying<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.290> something<00:00:43.530> fall

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
career mode saying that something fall

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.549 
career mode saying that something fall
from<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> sky<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.899> basically<00:00:46.200> what

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
from the sky and that's basically what

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
from the sky and that's basically what
the<00:00:46.649> career<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.780> then<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.870> you're

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the career is and then when you're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
the career is and then when you're
actually<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.120> track<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.469> map

want it to stop Bush didn't want us to
go<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> find<00:01:02.340> something<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:04.460> but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
go down here to find something out but

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420 
go down here to find something out but
at<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.540> moment<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.650> idea<00:01:07.860> rather<00:01:08.250> than

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
at the moment I have no idea rather than

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
at the moment I have no idea rather than
I've<00:01:08.880> done<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> research<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> tried<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
I've done a bit of research and tried to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
I've done a bit of research and tried to
figure<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.780> fifth<00:01:13.110> key<00:01:13.500> could

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
figure out what the fifth key could

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
figure out what the fifth key could
possibly<00:01:14.400> look<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:15.380> but

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
possibly look like but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.620 
possibly look like but
I<00:01:18.060> could<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.440> find<00:01:19.830> anything<00:01:20.630> very

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I could not really find anything very

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
I could not really find anything very
helpful<00:01:23.120> still<00:01:24.120> looking<00:01:24.450> around<00:01:24.920> trying<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
helpful still looking around trying to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.140 
helpful still looking around trying to
find<00:01:26.400> something<00:01:26.760> which<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> place

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
find something which looks out of place

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
find something which looks out of place
cuz<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.390> personally<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
cuz I'm personally I don't think it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
cuz I'm personally I don't think it's
something<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.550> you'd<00:01:32.700> access<00:01:33.150> within<00:01:33.510> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
something that you'd access within the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.219 
something that you'd access within the
air<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.220> editor<00:01:35.850> menu<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
air at all editor menu in here so I

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.510 
air at all editor menu in here so I
don't<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:41.330> what<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.479> could<00:01:42.510> look<00:01:42.900> like<00:01:43.520> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't know what it could look like so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
don't know what it could look like so
and<00:01:44.760> there's<00:01:45.210> basically<00:01:45.420> no<00:01:46.110> hints<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.800> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and there's basically no hints to it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.990 
and there's basically no hints to it
other<00:01:47.070> than<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.720> called<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.229> fifth<00:01:49.470> key

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
other than it's called the fifth key

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
other than it's called the fifth key
originally<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> thought<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.600> might<00:01:51.869> have

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
originally I thought it might have

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.980 
originally I thought it might have
something<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.800> this<00:01:53.040> part<00:01:53.369> over<00:01:53.520> here

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
something to do with this part over here

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.469 
something to do with this part over here
I'll<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.470> waste<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.940> here<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.300> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
I'll just a waste over here it's this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.880 
I'll just a waste over here it's this
way<00:01:58.220> towards<00:01:59.220> Big<00:01:59.610> C<00:01:59.820> um<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.750> had<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> theory

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
way towards Big C um I had a theory

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.400 
way towards Big C um I had a theory
because<00:02:02.520> obviously<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.050> film

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
because obviously there's the film

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.850 
because obviously there's the film
called<00:02:04.770> her<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.369> fifth<00:02:05.580> element<00:02:06.289> which<00:02:07.289> has

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
called her the fifth element which has

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
called her the fifth element which has
milla<00:02:08.160> jovovich<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:11.450> from<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> butcher

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
milla jovovich and from the butcher

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.120 
milla jovovich and from the butcher
named<00:02:13.260> button<00:02:14.190> bruce<00:02:15.000> willis<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.130> basically

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
named button bruce willis and basically

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.430 
named button bruce willis and basically
they<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.940> find<00:02:18.180> these<00:02:18.360> four<00:02:18.780> stones

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
they have to find these four stones

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.340 
they have to find these four stones
which<00:02:19.680> represent<00:02:20.280> an<00:02:20.520> element<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.989> look

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
which represent an element and they look

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.949 
which represent an element and they look
so<00:02:22.830> similar<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.450> i've<00:02:24.600> gone<00:02:24.750> round

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so similar to this and i've gone round

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.170 
so similar to this and i've gone round
the<00:02:25.350> whole<00:02:25.590> map<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.130> there<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.459> only<00:02:26.640> four<00:02:27.030> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the whole map and there is only four of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.530 
the whole map and there is only four of
these<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.739> there's<00:02:28.739> one<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:30.090> just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
these and there's one here is one just

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.140 
these and there's one here is one just
over<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.380> side<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.400> square<00:02:32.730> bird<00:02:32.970> in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
over this side on the square bird in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.570 
over this side on the square bird in
there

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
there

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.660 
there
then<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.680> quickly<00:02:37.450> fly<00:02:38.450> over<00:02:38.480> there

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
then if we just quickly fly over there

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.410 
then if we just quickly fly over there
got<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.820> fly<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.390> slow<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.500> I'm<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:44.060> over

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
got it fly so slow but I'm just over

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.970 
got it fly so slow but I'm just over
this<00:02:44.540> region<00:02:44.750> over<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> circular

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
this region over on the circular

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.360 
this region over on the circular
platform<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.880> other<00:02:47.000> one<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:49.010> over

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
platform as the other one and just over

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.790 
platform as the other one and just over
on<00:02:49.460> my<00:02:49.610> circular<00:02:50.210> iphone<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.410> background

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
on my circular iphone in the background

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.300 
on my circular iphone in the background
there<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.120> another<00:02:53.360> one<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:55.280> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
there there is another one so I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.280 
there there is another one so I
originally<00:02:55.670> thought<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.300> could<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.720> symbolize

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
originally thought it could to symbolize

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.450 
originally thought it could to symbolize
and<00:02:58.210> something<00:02:59.210> in<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.420> middle<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.860> lake

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
and something in the middle of this lake

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.340 
and something in the middle of this lake
but<00:03:02.330> I've<00:03:02.390> been<00:03:02.570> under<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:03.050> there's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
but I've been under then there's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.460 
but I've been under then there's
literally<00:03:03.770> nothing<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.300> at<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.020> moment<00:03:06.170> I'm

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
literally nothing so at the moment I'm

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.460 
literally nothing so at the moment I'm
kind<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.860> stumped<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.190> ideas<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.320> you

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
kind of stumped for ideas and but if you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.260 
kind of stumped for ideas and but if you
guys<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.950> any<00:03:10.040> theories<00:03:10.340> please<00:03:10.850> leave<00:03:11.090> them

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
guys have any theories please leave them

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.440 
guys have any theories please leave them
in<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.510> comment<00:03:11.720> below<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.180> know

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
in a comment below and if you know

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.590 
in a comment below and if you know
someone<00:03:14.660> who's<00:03:14.810> quite<00:03:15.050> big<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.380> two<00:03:15.590> trials

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
someone who's quite big in two trials

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600 
someone who's quite big in two trials
then<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.740> could<00:03:18.890> ask<00:03:19.070> them<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.459> come

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
then like you could ask them to come

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.410 
then like you could ask them to come
over<00:03:19.730> here<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.320> then<00:03:21.820> give<00:03:22.820> some<00:03:23.000> suggestions

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
over here and then give some suggestions

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.840 
over here and then give some suggestions
and<00:03:23.900> I'm<00:03:24.140> gonna<00:03:24.560> try<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.280> cheap<00:03:25.580> now

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
and I'm gonna try and get as cheap now

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.820 
and I'm gonna try and get as cheap now
as<00:03:26.060> soon<00:03:26.330> as<00:03:26.540> possible<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.260> people<00:03:27.680> can

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
as soon as possible so that people can

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.130 
as soon as possible so that people can
start<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:28.280> there<00:03:28.520> because<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.990> the

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
start in there because it's one of the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.400 
start in there because it's one of the
most<00:03:30.380> elusive<00:03:31.780> achievements<00:03:32.780> ever<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.790> presume

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
most elusive achievements ever I presume

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.600 
most elusive achievements ever I presume
but

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.360 
but
nah<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.670> don't<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.239> there's<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.370> much

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
nah I don't think there's really much

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.610 
nah I don't think there's really much
else<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:42.090> say<00:03:43.519> and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.190 

one<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.800> things<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.069> did<00:03:48.310> research<00:03:49.200> when

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
one of the things that did research when

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.650 
one of the things that did research when
i<00:03:50.230> typed<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.770> fifth<00:03:51.130> key<00:03:51.430> was<00:03:51.730> something

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
i typed in the fifth key was something

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.940 
i typed in the fifth key was something
about<00:03:55.200> music<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.500> circle<00:03:57.220> fifths<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:59.530> don't

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
about music a circle fifths and I don't

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.150 
about music a circle fifths and I don't
know<00:04:00.069> whether<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.370> means<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.900> fifth<00:04:02.200> key

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
know whether it means like the fifth key

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.010 
know whether it means like the fifth key
in<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.580> circle<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.090> fifths<00:04:04.680> or<00:04:06.209> what<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.900> be

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
in a circle of fifths or what to be

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.400 
in a circle of fifths or what to be
honest<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.480> don't<00:04:10.750> think<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.319> would

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
honest so that is I don't think it would

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
honest so that is I don't think it would
be<00:04:11.470> something<00:04:11.709> related<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:13.630> it

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
be something related to that but it

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.319 
be something related to that but it
could<00:04:14.080> be<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.709> with<00:04:14.860> some<00:04:15.069> being<00:04:15.550> here<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
could be to do with some being here and

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.750 
could be to do with some being here and
having<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.840> certain<00:04:17.169> music<00:04:17.829> track<00:04:18.130> on<00:04:18.340> through

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
having a certain music track on through

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.409 
having a certain music track on through
the<00:04:18.940> menus<00:04:19.329> I'll<00:04:20.019> see<00:04:20.260> if<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:20.590> find<00:04:20.739> it

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the menus I'll see if I can find it

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.640 
the menus I'll see if I can find it
music<00:04:22.419> playlist<00:04:22.870> there<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.870> edit

song<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:31.930> was<00:04:32.139> thinking<00:04:32.200> possibly<00:04:33.100> some

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
song so I was thinking possibly some

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.909 
song so I was thinking possibly some

triumph select which music she wants to
continue<00:04:39.280> listening<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:40.120> when<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.690> go<00:04:40.900> into

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
continue listening to when you go into

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.670 
continue listening to when you go into
the<00:04:41.229> great<00:04:41.410> career<00:04:41.740> um<00:04:43.290> another<00:04:44.290> possibility

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
the great career um another possibility

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.730 
the great career um another possibility
is<00:04:45.330> there's<00:04:46.330> something<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.900> do<00:04:47.050> with<00:04:47.290> em<00:04:48.660> this

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
is there's something to do with em this

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.170 
is there's something to do with em this
character<00:04:50.740> in<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.950> book<00:04:50.979> called<00:04:51.340> lady<00:04:51.669> Friday

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
character in a book called lady Friday

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.300 
character in a book called lady Friday
and<00:04:53.250> basically<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.520> um<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.960> think<00:04:56.800> there's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and basically this um I think there's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.020 
and basically this um I think there's
seven<00:04:57.729> different<00:04:58.390> people<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.669> have<00:05:00.669> like<00:05:00.880> a

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
seven different people that have like a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.480 
seven different people that have like a
prefix<00:05:01.600> on<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.960> name<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.410> then<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:03.070> suffix

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
prefix on the name and then the suffix

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.070 
prefix on the name and then the suffix
is<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:04.620> day<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.039> week<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.960> basically<00:05:07.960> all

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
is a day of the week and basically all

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.679 
is a day of the week and basically all
these<00:05:08.380> people<00:05:08.680> have

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.729 

control<00:05:12.679> over<00:05:12.709> these<00:05:13.099> keys<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:14.029> her<00:05:14.659> key<00:05:14.989> is<00:05:15.289> a

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:15.739 
control over these keys and her key is a

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:20.019 
control over these keys and her key is a
mirror<00:05:16.549> or<00:05:16.879> it<00:05:17.179> appears<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.539> be<00:05:17.659> a<00:05:17.749> mirror<00:05:19.029> so

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
mirror or it appears to be a mirror so

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.549 
mirror or it appears to be a mirror so
unless<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.929> can<00:05:21.139> find<00:05:21.319> a<00:05:21.469> mirror<00:05:22.239> then<00:05:23.239> I<00:05:23.629> don't

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:24.559 
unless I can find a mirror then I don't

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:27.129 
unless I can find a mirror then I don't
know<00:05:24.709> what<00:05:24.889> it<00:05:25.009> could<00:05:25.249> be<00:05:25.569> there's<00:05:26.569> only<00:05:26.779> one

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
know what it could be there's only one

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.379 
know what it could be there's only one
other<00:05:27.169> place<00:05:27.649> I<00:05:27.860> haven't<00:05:28.249> really<00:05:28.879> explored

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
other place I haven't really explored

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.529 
other place I haven't really explored
and<00:05:30.489> this<00:05:31.489> is<00:05:31.669> what's<00:05:31.879> leading<00:05:32.089> me<00:05:32.389> to<00:05:32.509> think

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
and this is what's leading me to think

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.539 
and this is what's leading me to think
it's<00:05:33.429> probably<00:05:34.429> buried<00:05:34.759> underground<00:05:35.149> is

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:36.549 
it's probably buried underground is

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:40.239 
it's probably buried underground is
they've<00:05:37.549> got<00:05:37.789> ruins<00:05:38.209> in<00:05:38.599> the<00:05:38.659> track<00:05:39.499> menu<00:05:39.979> and

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:40.249 
they've got ruins in the track menu and

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.249 
they've got ruins in the track menu and
over<00:05:40.939> here<00:05:41.379> you<00:05:42.379> can<00:05:42.559> kind<00:05:42.829> of<00:05:42.919> see<00:05:42.979> like
