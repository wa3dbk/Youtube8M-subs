00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.320
 make an envelope from a plain sheet of paper 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:16.199
 a4 and so take a sheet a4 fold it 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.830
 First , the main thing is to do Churov 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.010
 so that the envelope is very beautiful 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.010
 so we deploy and fold like this 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:42.480
 again, we have turned out 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:44.730
 now places with two angles any need 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 roll up like this so that they 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 laid down on this line so doing clearly 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.610
 lines right on to do 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:12.799
 so do it now we take and mean 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.759
 here we are and here we've got such a 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:22.690
 figure now we take and here these here 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:29.360
 parts what's this part 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:41.450
 touched it whipped like this first 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:47.030
 sleep and bent now with us 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:51.800
 it so happens now the top of us 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 we bend it this way so that 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.920
 bend so that this edge touched 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:04.220
 with this where one ate to touch 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 that is, that's what happened, that is 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 wasp gun and so take 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.430
 it was so now 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:37.439
 loomed envelope such but it 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:42.239
 not all now we take this 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:49.010
 open and we need this part 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:57.230
 bend here for these holes here 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:01.049
 they cut here everything is bent and here it is 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.690
 covered all the envelope is ready now here 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.060
 if you need to put it now you can go there 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.780
 you can of course put anything for 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.540
 strength here and here it is glue everything well I 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.609
 But without glue I did the same for a few years 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.730
 now put even further some 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.069
 the envelope 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.049
 but it looks very good
