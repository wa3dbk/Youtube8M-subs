hi<00:00:12.720> this<00:00:13.020> is<00:00:13.050> Ted<00:00:13.350> Rackley<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:13.920> use<00:00:14.250> research

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
hi this is Ted Rackley from use research

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.039 
hi this is Ted Rackley from use research
and<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:14.970> going<00:00:15.090> to<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.300> you<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.750> know

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
and I'm going to show you how you know

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.710 
and I'm going to show you how you know
wire<00:00:16.230> works<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.040> receptor<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:18.450> is<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
wire works on the receptor this is the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.980 
wire works on the receptor this is the
receptor<00:00:19.110> here<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:20.160> hardware

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
receptor here it's a hardware

trilogy from spectrasonics now I'm going
to<00:01:13.110> play<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.530> mini<00:01:13.800> sequence<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> I've

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to play a little mini sequence that I've

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
to play a little mini sequence that I've
composed<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> merely

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
composed here and I want you to merely

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
composed here and I want you to merely
make<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.410> note<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.010> cpu<00:01:17.430> performance<00:01:17.640> meter

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
make a note of the cpu performance meter

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.700 
make a note of the cpu performance meter
between<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.080> i'm<00:01:19.170> playing<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.680> i

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
between when i'm playing and when i

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.170 
between when i'm playing and when i
stopped<00:01:20.010> so<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.490> go

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.530 

you<00:01:23.720> see<00:01:23.900> here<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.290> CPU<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.890> about<00:01:25.540> five

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
you see here the CPU is about five

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.750 
you see here the CPU is about five
percent<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.650> when<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.800> stop<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.280> still<00:01:28.490> around

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
percent and when I stop it still around

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.630 
percent and when I stop it still around
five<00:01:29.660> percent<00:01:30.050> or<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.920> reason<00:01:31.100> being<00:01:31.400> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
five percent or so the reason being is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.830 
five percent or so the reason being is
none<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.940> these<00:01:32.060> plugins<00:01:32.300> are<00:01:32.540> actually

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
none of these plugins are actually

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840 
none of these plugins are actually
installed<00:01:33.260> inside<00:01:33.650> of<00:01:33.800> its<00:01:33.920> laptop<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
installed inside of its laptop the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.760 
installed inside of its laptop the
plugins<00:01:35.240> are<00:01:35.360> installed<00:01:35.560> inside<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
plugins are installed inside of the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.200 
plugins are installed inside of the
receptor<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.250> we're<00:01:37.340> communicating<00:01:37.520> with

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
receptor and we're communicating with

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.380 
receptor and we're communicating with
them<00:01:38.390> via<00:01:38.840> our<00:01:39.110> unit<00:01:39.440> wire<00:01:39.590> VST<00:01:40.280> plugins<00:01:40.729> so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
them via our unit wire VST plugins so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.570 
them via our unit wire VST plugins so
here's<00:01:41.660> how<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.500> works<00:01:42.680> I'll<00:01:42.950> trace<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> MIDI

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
here's how it works I'll trace the MIDI

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.460 
here's how it works I'll trace the MIDI
signal<00:01:43.940> flow<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.750> MIDI<00:01:44.930> track<00:01:45.200> goes

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
signal flow with you the MIDI track goes

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.250 
signal flow with you the MIDI track goes
to<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.070> virtual<00:01:46.760> instrument<00:01:47.479> plug-in<00:01:47.840> and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
to the virtual instrument plug-in and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.600 
to the virtual instrument plug-in and
I'll<00:01:48.410> open<00:01:48.650> up<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.800> plug-in<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.369> can<00:01:49.460> take

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
I'll open up the plug-in so you can take

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.550 
I'll open up the plug-in so you can take
a<00:01:49.640> look<00:01:49.820> at<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.240> our<00:01:50.750> plugin<00:01:51.050> really<00:01:51.320> isn't

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
a look at it and our plugin really isn't

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.200 
a look at it and our plugin really isn't
a<00:01:51.619> virtual<00:01:51.950> instrument<00:01:52.369> it's<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.910> network

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
a virtual instrument it's a network

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.690 
a virtual instrument it's a network
interface<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.050> receptor<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.160> many<00:01:55.399> goes

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
interface to the receptor so many goes

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.790 
interface to the receptor so many goes
into<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.840> receptor<00:01:58.360> over<00:01:59.360> ethernet<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.710> have

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
into the receptor over ethernet we have

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100 
into the receptor over ethernet we have
an<00:02:00.890> ethernet<00:02:01.040> cable<00:02:01.280> plugged<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.110> there's

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
an ethernet cable plugged in and there's

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.350 
an ethernet cable plugged in and there's
the<00:02:03.350> trilogy<00:02:03.800> plug-in<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.399> i'm<00:02:04.880> playing<00:02:05.030> so

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
the trilogy plug-in that i'm playing so

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.999 
the trilogy plug-in that i'm playing so
i<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.540> look<00:02:05.660> at<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.840> graphics<00:02:06.080> over<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
i can look at the graphics over that

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.969 
i can look at the graphics over that
ethernet<00:02:07.310> cable<00:02:07.759> as<00:02:07.940> well<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.350> trilogy<00:02:09.770> makes

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
ethernet cable as well the trilogy makes

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.160 
ethernet cable as well the trilogy makes
the<00:02:10.130> sound<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.729> then<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.850> audio<00:02:11.300> passes<00:02:11.900> out

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the sound and then the audio passes out

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380 
the sound and then the audio passes out
of<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.800> plug-in<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:13.610> into<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.030> audio

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
of the plug-in and then into my audio

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.820 
of the plug-in and then into my audio
mixer<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.900> that's<00:02:15.080> why<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> see<00:02:15.440> audio

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
mixer so that's why you see audio

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
mixer so that's why you see audio
metering<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.660> plug-in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
metering right here and this plug-in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
metering right here and this plug-in
since<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> network<00:02:18.739> interface<00:02:18.920> receptors

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
since it's a network interface receptors

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.449 
since it's a network interface receptors
a<00:02:19.820> 16<00:02:20.239> channel<00:02:20.510> device<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.890> each<00:02:22.160> one

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
a 16 channel device I can have each one

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.710 
a 16 channel device I can have each one
of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.330> channels<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.110> receptor<00:02:25.720> be

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
of the channels of the receptor be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.199 
of the channels of the receptor be
addressed<00:02:27.080> by<00:02:27.709> MIDI<00:02:27.980> right<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.970> basically

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
addressed by MIDI right so I basically

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.720 
addressed by MIDI right so I basically
have<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> 73<00:02:30.260> port<00:02:30.560> midi<00:02:30.890> interface<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.580> each

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
have a 73 port midi interface and each

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
have a 73 port midi interface and each
port<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.120> midi<00:02:32.299> carries<00:02:32.900> 16<00:02:33.230> channels<00:02:33.620> okay

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
port of midi carries 16 channels okay

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.060 
port of midi carries 16 channels okay
plus<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.660> receptor<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> 16<00:02:36.500> channel<00:02:36.799> device

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
plus the receptor is a 16 channel device

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.400 
plus the receptor is a 16 channel device
do<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.430> 16<00:02:37.730> stereo<00:02:38.420> channels<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.959> audio<00:02:39.049> or

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
do I have 16 stereo channels of audio or

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.860 
do I have 16 stereo channels of audio or
32<00:02:39.830> mono<00:02:40.070> channels<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.610> audio<00:02:40.700> passing<00:02:41.630> over

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
32 mono channels of audio passing over

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.710 
32 mono channels of audio passing over
Ethernet<00:02:42.410> back<00:02:42.890> into<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.120> computer<00:02:44.600> and

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
Ethernet back into the computer and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.180 
Ethernet back into the computer and
that's<00:02:45.200> why<00:02:45.410> everything<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:45.920> showing<00:02:46.100> up

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's why everything is showing up

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.400 
that's why everything is showing up
right<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.459> on<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.730> audio<00:02:47.030> mixer<00:02:47.360> now<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.110> have

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
right here on my audio mixer now I have

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
right here on my audio mixer now I have
an<00:02:48.500> instrument<00:02:49.010> version<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.489> plug-in<00:02:49.880> but

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
an instrument version of the plug-in but

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
an instrument version of the plug-in but
i<00:02:50.510> also<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:51.019> an<00:02:51.350> effects<00:02:51.860> version<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
i also have an effects version of the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.800 
i also have an effects version of the
plugin<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.820> if<00:02:52.880> i<00:02:52.970> open<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.480> audio

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
plugin so if i open up this audio

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
plugin so if i open up this audio
channel<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.160> right<00:02:55.400> here<00:02:55.580> i<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
channel here you see right here i have a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.850 
channel here you see right here i have a
unit<00:02:56.239> wire<00:02:56.360> effects<00:02:56.870> version<00:02:57.680> which<00:02:57.830> is

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
unit wire effects version which is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.810 
unit wire effects version which is
different<00:02:58.160> from<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.610> know<00:02:58.700> our

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
different from the you know our

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.150 
different from the you know our
instrument<00:02:59.360> versions<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.650> i<00:03:00.680> take<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.950> look<00:03:01.070> at

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
instrument versions so i take a look at

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.289 
instrument versions so i take a look at
that<00:03:01.220> plug<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.580> plugin<00:03:01.850> looks<00:03:02.030> very

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
that plug in the plugin looks very

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.360 
that plug in the plugin looks very
similar<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:03.410> i<00:03:03.470> want<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.920> make<00:03:04.130> note<00:03:04.340> that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
similar but i want you to make note that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.660 
similar but i want you to make note that
i<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:04.850> an<00:03:05.150> ethernet<00:03:05.989> switch<00:03:06.560> attached<00:03:07.459> as

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
i have an ethernet switch attached as

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.009 
i have an ethernet switch attached as
well<00:03:07.850> i<00:03:07.880> don't<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.150> if<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.299> guys<00:03:08.420> can<00:03:08.660> see

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
well i don't know if you guys can see

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.560 
well i don't know if you guys can see
this<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.459> every<00:03:10.850> receptor<00:03:11.360> in

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
this here and we have every receptor in

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.330 
this here and we have every receptor in
our<00:03:11.720> booth<00:03:11.930> attached<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.920> season<00:03:13.220> asst

our booth attached to the season asst
which<00:03:13.549> we<00:03:13.760> have<00:03:13.850> three<00:03:14.090> receptors<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.930> at

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
which we have three receptors going at

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.080 
which we have three receptors going at
once<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.530> i've<00:03:16.070> got<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.250> pop-up<00:03:16.519> menu<00:03:16.940> that'll

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
once and i've got a pop-up menu that'll

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.120 
once and i've got a pop-up menu that'll
let<00:03:17.239> me<00:03:17.360> talk<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.350> different<00:03:18.680> receptors

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
let me talk to the different receptors

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
let me talk to the different receptors
that<00:03:19.160> i<00:03:19.340> want<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.610> talk<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.900> case

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
that i want to talk to so in this case

that i want to talk to so in this case
i'm<00:03:21.440> going<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.709> talk<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:23.150> receptor<00:03:23.690> over

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
i'm going to talk to this receptor over

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900 
i'm going to talk to this receptor over
here<00:03:24.110> which<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.350> can<00:03:24.470> see<00:03:24.650> has<00:03:24.920> stylus

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
here which you can see has stylus

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.490 
here which you can see has stylus
installed<00:03:26.420> on<00:03:26.600> it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
installed on it

computer I can look at the graphics that
are<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:36.110> receptor<00:03:36.770> that's<00:03:36.890> somewhere<00:03:37.190> else

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
are in a receptor that's somewhere else

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.160 
are in a receptor that's somewhere else
so<00:03:37.880> receptors<00:03:38.330> can<00:03:38.420> be<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.690> machine<00:03:38.840> room

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
so receptors can be in a machine room

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.560 
so receptors can be in a machine room
somewhere<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.880> what<00:03:41.180> I'm<00:03:41.240> going<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.390> do<00:03:41.480> is

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
somewhere and what I'm going to do is

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.060 
somewhere and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:41.660> going<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.810> talk<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.530> know<00:03:42.620> wire<00:03:42.800> on

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
I'm going to talk to you know wire on

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.870 
I'm going to talk to you know wire on
channel<00:03:43.880> 16<00:03:44.240> of<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.200> receptor<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.730> is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
channel 16 of this receptor and this is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.130 
channel 16 of this receptor and this is
really<00:03:47.060> amazing<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:47.600> what<00:03:47.900> I'm<00:03:47.990> going<00:03:48.110> to

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
really amazing because what I'm going to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.330 
really amazing because what I'm going to
do<00:03:48.260> here<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.440> I'm<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.680> throw<00:03:48.950> my<00:03:49.160> voice

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
do here is I'm going to throw my voice

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.480 
do here is I'm going to throw my voice
I'm<00:03:49.880> going<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.120> play<00:03:50.300> trilogy<00:03:50.959> inside<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:52.100> this

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
I'm going to play trilogy inside of this

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.190 
I'm going to play trilogy inside of this
receptor<00:03:53.060> here<00:03:53.420> but<00:03:53.780> I'm<00:03:53.870> going<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.020> run

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
receptor here but I'm going to run

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.620 
receptor here but I'm going to run
through<00:03:54.230> an<00:03:54.830> effects<00:03:55.220> version<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.330> unit

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
through an effects version of the unit

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.220 
through an effects version of the unit
wire<00:03:56.750> plug<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.310> sending<00:03:58.550> audio<00:03:59.230> over

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
wire plug in that is sending audio over

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.380 
wire plug in that is sending audio over
to<00:04:00.350> this<00:04:00.470> receptor<00:04:00.950> because<00:04:01.220> your<00:04:01.940> instrument

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
to this receptor because your instrument

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.210 
to this receptor because your instrument
plugins<00:04:02.660> receive<00:04:03.020> MIDI<00:04:03.230> effects<00:04:03.950> plugins

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
plugins receive MIDI effects plugins

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580 
plugins receive MIDI effects plugins
receive<00:04:04.670> audio<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.900> here's<00:04:06.260> how<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.530> is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
receive audio so here's how this is

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.580 
receive audio so here's how this is
going<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.830> work<00:04:07.900> let<00:04:08.900> me<00:04:08.959> turn<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.140> up<00:04:09.320> here<00:04:09.470> so

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
going to work let me turn it up here so

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.260 
going to work let me turn it up here so
you<00:04:09.650> can<00:04:09.770> hear<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:13.580> trilogy<00:04:13.880> is

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
you can hear it so this trilogy is

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.870 
you can hear it so this trilogy is
inside<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:14.959> receptor<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:16.010> going<00:04:16.370> audio

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
inside of this receptor it's going audio

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.120 
inside of this receptor it's going audio
over<00:04:17.299> ethernet<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.019> playing<00:04:18.560> out<00:04:18.829> of<00:04:18.859> the
