sky-blue and this way you can get like a
color<00:01:22.979> color<00:01:23.820> accuracy<00:01:24.180> pretty<00:01:24.659> fast<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
color color accuracy pretty fast and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
color color accuracy pretty fast and
then<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> might<00:01:26.189> make<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> thickness<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.540> my

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
then I might make the thickness of my

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
then I might make the thickness of my
line<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> little<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.380> thicker<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> can

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
line a little bit thicker so that I can

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
line a little bit thicker so that I can
cover<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> might<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.229> bat<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
cover more and then I might use a bat to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
cover more and then I might use a bat to
show<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> mean<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.420> far<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
show is just what you mean as far as the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.149 
show is just what you mean as far as the
blue<00:01:37.079> goes<00:01:37.380> oh<00:01:38.990> yeah<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.979> blue

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
blue goes oh yeah that's that's the blue

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.740 
blue goes oh yeah that's that's the blue
that<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.470> accidentally

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that I need and you don't accidentally

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
that I need and you don't accidentally
make<00:01:45.750> some<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> blue<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.369> doing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
make some kind of blue that's I'm doing
this<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.850> fast<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> way<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.840> would

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this really fast by the way I would

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
this really fast by the way I would
spend<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:49.770> doing<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.549> we're<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
spend more time doing this if we're on a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.760 
spend more time doing this if we're on a
time<00:01:51.899> limit<00:01:52.759> but<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.380> stops

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
time limit but this really like stops

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
time limit but this really like stops
you<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.450> accidentally<00:01:57.450> doing<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> wrong

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you from accidentally doing the wrong

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.679 
you from accidentally doing the wrong
color<00:01:58.350> blue<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> puts

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
color blue and it also kind of puts

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
color blue and it also kind of puts
their<00:02:00.869> mind<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.259> ease<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.549> they

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
their mind at ease so that they they

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.639 
their mind at ease so that they they
know<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.750> blue<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.200> talking

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
about and so then I might go back to a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790 
about and so then I might go back to a
smaller<00:02:09.239> line<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.200> detail<00:02:10.590> where

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
smaller line for detail where

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.150 
smaller line for detail where

of the extent of of what can really be
done<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.890> this<00:05:06.070> program<00:05:06.580> but<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.240> really<00:05:07.540> has

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
done with this program but it really has

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.080 
done with this program but it really has
a<00:05:07.750> lot<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.320> really<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> lot<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.490> possibilities

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
this is very hard to do while talking I

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.990 
this is very hard to do while talking I
don't<00:05:19.120> know<00:05:19.210> how<00:05:19.300> I'd<00:05:19.450> knit<00:05:19.660> does<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:21.000> okay

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
don't know how I'd knit does this okay

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.740 
don't know how I'd knit does this okay
so<00:05:22.680> maybe<00:05:23.680> puts<00:05:24.070> on<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> shadow<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.910> here<00:05:27.750> give

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
so maybe puts on a shadow in here give

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:38.350 
so maybe puts on a shadow in here give
it<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:28.960> little<00:05:29.140> bit<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.380> depth

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.189 

okay<00:05:39.169> so<00:05:40.039> anyways<00:05:40.400> this<00:05:40.849> is<00:05:41.060> this<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:41.870> kind<00:05:42.110> of

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
okay so anyways this is this is kind of

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.499 
okay so anyways this is this is kind of
a<00:05:42.379> quick<00:05:42.860> example<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.669> how<00:05:43.759> you<00:05:43.969> can<00:05:44.180> use<00:05:44.389> an

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
a quick example of how you can use an

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.709 
a quick example of how you can use an
iPad<00:05:44.919> again<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:46.250> program<00:05:46.639> is<00:05:46.879> a<00:05:46.939> SketchBook

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
iPad again the program is a SketchBook

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.980 
iPad again the program is a SketchBook
Pro<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.590> it's<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.550> very<00:05:49.729> good<00:05:49.909> program<00:05:50.509> has<00:05:50.960> a

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
Pro and it's a very good program has a

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.980 
Pro and it's a very good program has a
lot<00:05:51.169> of<00:05:51.199> features<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.889> options<00:05:52.900> there's<00:05:53.900> a

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
lot of features and options there's a

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.800 
lot of features and options there's a
lot<00:05:54.110> of<00:05:54.229> different<00:05:54.530> tools<00:05:54.710> a<00:05:55.189> lot<00:05:55.729> of<00:05:55.879> presets

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
lot of different tools a lot of presets

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.290 
lot of different tools a lot of presets
and<00:05:57.050> things<00:05:57.289> that<00:05:57.530> they<00:05:57.740> have<00:05:57.889> on<00:05:58.069> here<00:05:58.300> for

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
and things that they have on here for

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.279 
and things that they have on here for
different<00:05:59.810> types<00:05:59.990> of<00:06:00.110> effects<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:02.840> you

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
different types of effects like a you

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.790 
different types of effects like a you
know<00:06:03.319> the<00:06:03.759> cross<00:06:04.759> hatching<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:05.659> I<00:06:05.870> think<00:06:06.710> they

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
know the cross hatching and I think they

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.409 
know the cross hatching and I think they
have<00:06:06.979> a<00:06:07.240> oops

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
have a oops

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.010 
have a oops
custard<00:06:09.050> they<00:06:09.860> have<00:06:10.039> a<00:06:10.629> ones<00:06:11.629> that<00:06:11.870> have<00:06:11.990> like

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
custard they have a ones that have like

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.600 
custard they have a ones that have like
leads<00:06:12.469> and<00:06:14.590> really<00:06:15.590> silly<00:06:15.889> ones<00:06:16.189> you<00:06:16.520> know

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
leads and really silly ones you know

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.999 
leads and really silly ones you know
like<00:06:16.639> eyeballs

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 
like eyeballs

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.809 
like eyeballs
let's<00:06:19.009> do<00:06:19.159> eyeball<00:06:19.550> britches<00:06:21.129> okay<00:06:22.129> so

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
let's do eyeball britches okay so

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.300 
let's do eyeball britches okay so
anyways<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.779> think<00:06:24.560> that's<00:06:24.889> a<00:06:24.979> good<00:06:25.129> example

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
anyways I think that's a good example

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.009 
anyways I think that's a good example
and<00:06:25.879> I<00:06:26.719> hope<00:06:27.050> this<00:06:27.199> was<00:06:27.379> helpful<00:06:27.710> for<00:06:27.740> you
