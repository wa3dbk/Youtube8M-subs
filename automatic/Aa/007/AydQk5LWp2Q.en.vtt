I<00:01:35.439> should<00:01:35.680> say<00:01:36.119> personally<00:01:37.119> I<00:01:37.180> think<00:01:37.329> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I should say personally I think the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.690 
I should say personally I think the
original<00:01:38.229> one<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.710> thicker<00:01:38.920> body<00:01:39.219> has<00:01:39.670> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
original one on the thicker body has a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.030 
original one on the thicker body has a
thicker<00:01:40.090> head<00:01:40.390> also<00:01:40.689> but<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.590> looks<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:41.829> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
thicker head also but it looks like the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.469 
thicker head also but it looks like the
sculpt<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.490> maybe<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.969> same<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:43.450> just

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
sculpt is maybe the same but just

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.300 
sculpt is maybe the same but just
squished<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.140> little<00:01:44.380> bit<00:01:44.500> for<00:01:44.649> that<00:01:44.680> one<00:01:44.950> it's

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
squished a little bit for that one it's

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.609 
squished a little bit for that one it's
hard<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.640> say<00:01:45.850> both<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.750> lantern<00:01:47.140> flashes

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
hard to say both of the lantern flashes

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.670 
hard to say both of the lantern flashes
have<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.039> same<00:01:48.280> body<00:01:48.549> as<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:50.049> medium<00:01:50.469> build

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
have the same body as the medium build

so he does have some differences of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.719 
so he does have some differences of
course<00:01:55.299> he<00:01:55.960> has<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.200> lightening<00:01:57.039> fire<00:01:57.310> stuff

actually<00:02:01.149> remoulded<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.079> time<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
actually remoulded this time so it

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.929 
actually remoulded this time so it
doesn't<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.829> an<00:02:02.950> S<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.430> back<00:02:03.670> for

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
Superman and it does come off I don't

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.740 
Superman and it does come off I don't
know<00:02:06.280> if<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.520> comes<00:02:06.729> off<00:02:06.880> intentionally<00:02:07.570> if

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
know if it comes off intentionally if

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.180 
know if it comes off intentionally if
the<00:02:07.960> glue<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.320> came<00:02:08.530> loose<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.920> don't<00:02:09.100> know

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the glue just came loose I don't know

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.979 
the glue just came loose I don't know
but<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> like<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.090> it's<00:02:10.239> removable<00:02:10.629> because<00:02:10.959> I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
but I like that it's removable because I

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.960 
but I like that it's removable because I
don't<00:02:11.170> really<00:02:11.319> care<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.640> guy<00:02:12.910> is

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
don't really care for it this guy is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.550 
don't really care for it this guy is
obviously<00:02:13.510> not<00:02:13.959> technically

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
obviously not technically

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.830 
obviously not technically
flash<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.640> figured<00:02:16.360> I'd<00:02:16.450> include<00:02:16.599> him

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
flash but I figured I'd include him

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.240 
flash but I figured I'd include him
because<00:02:16.989> why<00:02:17.140> not<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.800> only<00:02:18.010> real<00:02:18.130> difference

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
because why not the only real difference

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.970 
because why not the only real difference
he<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.450> head<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.170> new<00:02:20.319> sculpt<00:02:20.709> and

he has is the head it's a new sculpt and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.580 
he has is the head it's a new sculpt and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.890 
of course the paint application the Blue
Lantern<00:02:23.739> flash<00:02:24.250> has<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> full<00:02:25.300> new<00:02:25.420> paint<00:02:25.690> dip

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900

looking<00:02:28.360> figure<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.989> say<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> really

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
looking figure I have to say I really

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.309 
looking figure I have to say I really
like<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.770> shading<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.330> white<00:02:31.630> lantern<00:02:31.900> flash

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
like the shading the white lantern flash

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.020 
like the shading the white lantern flash
comes<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.830> all<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> lightning<00:02:33.370> stuff<00:02:33.610> again

them<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.140> be<00:03:08.230> honest<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.739> like<00:03:08.860> the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
them to be honest and I like the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.130 
them to be honest and I like the
character<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:10.239> if<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:10.780> going<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.959> only

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
character but if I was going to only

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.479 
character but if I was going to only
pick<00:03:11.319> one<00:03:11.620> I'd<00:03:11.799> probably<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.310> go<00:03:12.459> with

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
pick one I'd probably have to go with

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.890 
pick one I'd probably have to go with
the<00:03:12.640> Young<00:03:12.819> Justice<00:03:12.849> one<00:03:13.420> even<00:03:13.690> though<00:03:13.780> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the Young Justice one even though it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.690 
the Young Justice one even though it's
styling<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.590> face<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.099> little<00:03:15.400> bit<00:03:15.519> off

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
styling in the face is a little bit off

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.599 
styling in the face is a little bit off
because<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.200> looks<00:03:17.410> weird<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.459> me

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
because that one just looks weird to me

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.550 
because that one just looks weird to me
I<00:03:18.850> don't<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.660> red<00:03:19.810> hair<00:03:20.019> mixed<00:03:20.320> with<00:03:20.440> the

I don't like the red hair mixed with the
red<00:03:20.709> outfit<00:03:21.130> even<00:03:21.519> though<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.730> might<00:03:21.850> be

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
red outfit even though it might be

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.690 
red outfit even though it might be
accurate<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.859> face<00:03:24.100> looks<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.489> an

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
accurate and the face looks like an

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.259 
accurate and the face looks like an
adult

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
adult

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.660 
adult
just<00:03:25.930> shrunken<00:03:26.470> down<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.920> he<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.489> looks

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
just shrunken down so he just looks

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.670 
just shrunken down so he just looks
weird<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.000> me<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.329> plus<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.410> way<00:03:29.500> this

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
weird to me and plus I like the way this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580 
weird to me and plus I like the way this
one<00:03:29.739> has<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.280> black<00:03:30.459> detailing<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.690> red

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
one has the black detailing on the red

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.340 
one has the black detailing on the red
to<00:03:32.829> yellow<00:03:33.250> spots<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:34.750> pretty<00:03:34.959> cool<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
to yellow spots so it's pretty cool I

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.910 
to yellow spots so it's pretty cool I
like<00:03:35.620> it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
like it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.380 
like it
this<00:03:36.190> guy<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.549> sculpted<00:03:36.970> better<00:03:37.150> though

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
this guy is sculpted better though

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.150 
this guy is sculpted better though
because<00:03:37.569> he<00:03:37.810> has<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.140> gloves<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.980> boots

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
because he has the gloves and the boots

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.550 
because he has the gloves and the boots
sculpted<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.420> know<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.019> up<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
sculpted so you know it's all up to you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.949 
sculpted so you know it's all up to you
but<00:03:41.980> otherwise<00:03:42.310> they<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.790> are<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.480> they<00:03:43.930> all

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
but otherwise they all are just they all

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.140 
but otherwise they all are just they all
are<00:03:44.470> just<00:03:44.889> standard<00:03:45.850> DC<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:47.019> see<00:03:47.850> sculpts<00:03:48.910> and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
are just standard DC you see sculpts and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.180 
are just standard DC you see sculpts and
in<00:03:50.109> articulation<00:03:50.829> so<00:03:50.950> there's<00:03:51.100> nothing

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
in articulation so there's nothing

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.530 
in articulation so there's nothing
really<00:03:51.459> out<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.819> ordinary<00:03:51.910> with<00:03:52.359> these

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
really out of the ordinary with these

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.569 
really out of the ordinary with these
guys<00:03:52.750> if<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.440> was<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.739> choose<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:54.430> one

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
guys if I was going to choose just one

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.319 
guys if I was going to choose just one
to<00:03:54.880> be<00:03:55.060> my<00:03:55.269> main<00:03:55.540> flash<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.760> hate<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.880> say<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.120> but

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
to be my main flash I hate to say it but

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.849 
to be my main flash I hate to say it but
even<00:03:58.569> though<00:03:58.720> he's<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.380> thicker<00:03:59.650> body

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
even though he's on the thicker body

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.590 
even though he's on the thicker body
that's<00:04:00.190> probably<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.819> best<00:04:00.850> build<00:04:01.359> for

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
that's probably not the best build for

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.390 
that's probably not the best build for
flash<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.989> like<00:04:02.139> the<00:04:02.290> original<00:04:02.380> release<00:04:02.829> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
flash I like the original release the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.190 
flash I like the original release the
best<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.970> don't<00:04:04.239> think<00:04:04.569> they<00:04:04.660> reissued<00:04:05.019> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
best I don't think they reissued the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.870 
best I don't think they reissued the
plain<00:04:05.560> old<00:04:05.739> yellow<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.340> red<00:04:06.489> without

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
plain old yellow and red without

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.479 
plain old yellow and red without
metallic<00:04:07.510> flash<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.709> thinner<00:04:08.950> body<00:04:09.190> but

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
metallic flash on the thinner body but

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.309 
metallic flash on the thinner body but
if<00:04:09.609> they<00:04:09.760> did<00:04:10.060> please<00:04:10.359> let<00:04:10.600> me<00:04:10.750> know<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.170> you

if they did please let me know if you

if they did please let me know if you
know<00:04:11.590> about<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.920> because<00:04:12.850> I'd<00:04:13.000> like<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.180> pick

it up but if you want to go with a

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.789 
it up but if you want to go with a
thinner<00:04:16.060> build<00:04:16.329> this<00:04:16.989> metallic<00:04:17.350> one<00:04:17.680> is

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
thinner build this metallic one is

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.740 
thinner build this metallic one is
pretty<00:04:18.070> good<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.760> I<00:04:18.820> think<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.209> like<00:04:19.389> the<00:04:19.539> Wally

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
pretty good but I think I like the Wally

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.770 
pretty good but I think I like the Wally
West<00:04:20.019> one<00:04:20.229> just<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.500> little<00:04:20.530> bit<00:04:20.950> better<00:04:21.780> both

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
West one just a little bit better both

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
of their goals are a little bit too cold

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.339 
of their goals are a little bit too cold
or<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.729> little<00:04:24.940> bit<00:04:25.030> too<00:04:25.150> dark<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.539> think<00:04:25.599> but

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
or a little bit too dark I think but

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.360 
or a little bit too dark I think but
either<00:04:26.470> way<00:04:26.680> they're<00:04:26.919> all<00:04:27.039> really<00:04:27.190> good
