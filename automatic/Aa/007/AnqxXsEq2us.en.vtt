00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.370
 I find the central courtyard of the University of Cádiz 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.460
 in return the locomotive the funny thing 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.640
 the first railroad that our country ran 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.730
 This locomotive was built by the engineer Guillermo Murray 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.720
 clarify 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.940
 was the company about this is responsible for doing it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.670
 the copeco ran the incredible speed at 80 kilometers per hour kia 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.680
 the one in charge of carrying his rich silver minerals the forward recognized until 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.310
 fort hood 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.670
 The locomotive is such a historical importance on May 27, 1867 CD Lara 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 argument 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.640
 the arrival of the railroad 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 something that affects Chile 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.550
 it has to do with the development of mining in our region 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 mainly the minerals of signs and I presentations 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.240
 the rich mining entrepreneurs in this area are going to create the company closed 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 lanes copied the year 1849 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.720
 so that its cargo this rich load of silver minerals could arrive in a 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.140
 safe and reliable alfonso de valdés 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 this way the installation of the other country begins 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.869
 but the arrival of the railroad 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.980
 not only brought technical data 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 but also the creation of new cities and ports 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.640
 this is how the port of caldera was born in 1850 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 that replaced the old port of copiapó located in the current portoviejo 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 hugo cheek 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.670
 this new port wider and safer than the previous one 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.850
 will become one of the most important Pacific ports towards 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.850
 the second half of the 19th century 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.479
 not only the locomotive the copying is declared a national monument 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.659
 its stations in caldera and copiapó also have this distinction 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.320
 the copying station 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.010
 yes a few years ago 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 It worked on the initiative of a private individual as a railway museum and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.550
 currently it is in deplorable state is declared monument 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.830
 national on October 29, 1981 by decree 7800 this is it 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.479
 its counterpart the remodeled quarry station 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:02.699
 which currently houses the boiler station cultural center 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.399
 It was also declared a national monument 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.229
 the day before the decree 9045 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.229
 of July 20, 1984 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.269
 perhaps by the debates, just about every degree of regional storage 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.939
 that time the burden was the first the second was the third locomotive 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:29.729
 South America 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.489
 Our own research is done in Arequipa Peru 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.589
 at the National University of San Agustin in the Mostajo archive 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.919
 and subsequently also the bus investigations is a 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.529
 History of the railroad in Chile 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:41.829
 they show it 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.639
 the callao lima railway 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.219
 I ran 1850 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.329
 the railway 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.950
 the water and the British run 1849 therefore cost railroad would be the 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.299
 third South America first chile but the importance of this railroad then 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.859
 such given enciso first second third if not that he allowed the development 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.719
 mining industry in our country and with it the integral development and all this 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.109
