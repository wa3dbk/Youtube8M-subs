00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 I'm with a video of a very buggy today. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.349
 of the hour on the nep shot 14 w25 b to this 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.050
 It works then this blog is everything 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.309
 operating for 1.8 less than 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.160
 it will not work 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 is a very simple bank and how to apply 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 any item and any mob chose 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.520
 diego duplicate is not duplicate is type 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 Quad will fall 15 pct from the time it takes 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.680
 you put it is very good this bug is not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 This is not what I discovered, but it's a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 girl on the internet to find him then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 a very tight thing so few people 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.489
 you know, there was also in the video there already 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.719
 gives a net a favorite and is already 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.280
 subscribe to the channel so you do not lose 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.439
 more than one buggy more than 1 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 the update on the channel whom I go 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.740
 start first showing how hot 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.580
 limits you this area for blog 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 that there is in the corner do not sell 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.950
 shanxi shandong rate has one down 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.850
 selected block for 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.369
 you there on the four points of this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 year so here is a blood for those who do not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.770
 knows tank is is the loading area 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 of maine craft not here - you will get 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 to find 1010 something 00 some 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.170
 thing 0 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 so I to 070 can be 01 00 20 so much 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 does but has to have the first zero and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.880
 last zero 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:55.399
 hence you see in search the 15 0 15 to 0 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 then searched for the fifth something 15 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.869
 then the zero something king is very 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.790
 simple 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.860
 then it was just fine now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.729
 Let's find out where we can 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.380
 put such a cold site and this system 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.750
 can only put them looking at the ft 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.850
 for you now where the SPLA 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.850
 showing and looking at mars 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.550
 here will not work looking for 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.200
 this will not work and looking at 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 also is not functional then 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.850
 only these deals in green 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.460
 now you will have to do the following 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.700
 when you find the places you can 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.050
 You'll put two blocks in the block. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 brings grab a comparator and put and 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.120
 look for a then frame and put here 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.090
 with the item you want 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.400
 I have a bush with some problem. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.730
 After that I came here not to give 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.170
 very light it will double everything is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.500
 here and everyone here you can make a 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 gigantic barrier that until the end with 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.830
 systems can give a little bit of lego 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.570
 then make these two only for 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.240
 you can see 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.900
 done it all you do now is 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.210
 simply leave your world or leave 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.250
 the server you are doing this 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.920
 bug type does work on server and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:33.660
 works in a world if you will see brother 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:36.810
 It's just you close after that you come back 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.650
 on top of the player and enter the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.630
 world 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.700
 He's going to give us a trough. It's going to take a while. 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.700
 A little so I'm going back when I 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:52.620
 finish loading the world 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:58.620
 and then there is a ready-made 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.709
 To the group of dogs, then I'm there. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.070
 I'll take the one on the other front gave the 2 3 4 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.690
 5 6 almost seven pecs in the other 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.080
 practically filled the second football 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.240
 so look what I have for diamond 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.830
 now realizes that here not 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.299
 conditional upon not applying nor 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.550
 nothing happened 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.220
 only these two places do not know why it is 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.270
 a bank 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.250
 Now I want to show you one. 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.639
 another thing you can do with 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.500
 These feared death leaves the item that 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.280
 here's what he has that will work 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.430
 the bug and you grab any mob you 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.850
 I'll get the mob well the name 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:51.270
 rare here that everyone wants to have a 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:55.169
 Let's go horseback riding, even if 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.740
 connect to the server that dies and I'll 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.740
 leave and I will reopen one again that 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.750
 same scheme I taught I'm going back 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:11.400
 when it is charged and takes a 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:14.030
 I'm so sorry you saw what 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 happened and the diamonds returned to 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.250
 Serving He Just Happened 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.250
 doubled all game furniture 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:34.770
 now I'll show you with a 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:39.289
 another way that does not die that will propose 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.289
 that it will be infinitely duplicated 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:54.419
 again in the world and never the amount of 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.900
 pigs on this map now look at this 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.380
 in the middle 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:03.100
 Look at the number of bodies that have 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.949
 time not all of them to you kill him 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.900
 running mode is usually a little 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.300
 us you found weird fund one 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.610
 You want to put it here just will put 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.889
 realize that it will make millions of 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.900
 copies of this garbage 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.550
 this is very good and you realize that the 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.770
 Map not dog walk a little bit 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.600
 take but then kill all these 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.600
 pigs eat food forever with you 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.630
 normally return with your days in the 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.430
 tunnel gotthard music house I found 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.600
 A lot of break encounter to let him 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:44.229
 there is always progress in the actions of the 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.930
 bank as she left the song is a 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.310
 bank today he did but you are do not know if 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.250
 It works for version. 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.080
 definitive to 1.8 then a case you 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.610
 have this video and it does not work with 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.060
 You leave a comment there and explain. 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.820
 happening this video people just wanted 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.460
 show the time the bank for you 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.260
 Now you give it to me, I like it for myself. 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.860
