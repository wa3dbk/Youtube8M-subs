00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:27.309 
feel that it's from a safe source but

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.909 
feel that it's from a safe source but
what<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:27.579> it<00:00:27.700> wasn't<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:29.410> if<00:00:29.500> it<00:00:29.619> was<00:00:29.710> from<00:00:29.829> a

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
what if it wasn't what if it was from a

what if it wasn't what if it was from a
source<00:00:30.160> like<00:00:30.969> this<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:34.120> statistics<00:00:34.899> would

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
source like this then statistics would

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.319 
source like this then statistics would
actually<00:00:35.320> say<00:00:35.559> that<00:00:36.190> half<00:00:36.579> of<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.910> would<00:00:37.149> now

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
actually say that half of you would now

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.569 
actually say that half of you would now
be<00:00:37.510> suffering<00:00:37.960> with<00:00:38.170> diarrhea<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:41.399> talked<00:00:42.399> a

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
be suffering with diarrhea I talked a

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.899 
be suffering with diarrhea I talked a
lot<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.969> past<00:00:43.239> about<00:00:43.600> statistics<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.909> the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
lot in the past about statistics and the

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.049 
lot in the past about statistics and the
provision<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.359> safe<00:00:46.569> drinking<00:00:46.989> water<00:00:47.019> for<00:00:47.379> all

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
provision of safe drinking water for all

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.430 
provision of safe drinking water for all
but<00:00:49.059> they<00:00:49.149> just<00:00:49.359> don't<00:00:49.510> seem<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.839> get<00:00:50.050> through

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
but they just don't seem to get through

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.139 
but they just don't seem to get through
and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.879> think<00:00:51.940> I've<00:00:52.269> worked<00:00:52.300> out<00:00:52.749> why<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and I think I've worked out why it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930 
and I think I've worked out why it's
because<00:00:55.149> using<00:00:55.809> current<00:00:56.350> thinking<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:57.489> scale

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
because using current thinking the scale

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.930 
because using current thinking the scale
of<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.269> problem<00:00:58.690> just<00:00:59.409> seems<00:00:59.679> too<00:01:00.069> huge<00:01:00.609> to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
of the problem just seems too huge to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.200 
of the problem just seems too huge to
contemplate<00:01:01.479> solving<00:01:02.639> so<00:01:03.639> we<00:01:03.760> just<00:01:03.940> switch

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
contemplate solving so we just switch

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.680 
contemplate solving so we just switch
off<00:01:04.440> US<00:01:06.030> governments<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.270> aid<00:01:08.260> agencies<00:01:09.690> well

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
off US governments and aid agencies well

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.170 
off US governments and aid agencies well
today<00:01:11.049> I'd<00:01:11.560> like<00:01:11.620> to<00:01:11.799> show<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.610> through

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
today I'd like to show you that through

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.630 
today I'd like to show you that through
thinking<00:01:13.510> differently<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.770> problem<00:01:15.190> has

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
thinking differently the problem has

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.250 
thinking differently the problem has
been<00:01:15.670> solved<00:01:17.910> by<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:18.970> way<00:01:19.060> since<00:01:19.960> I've<00:01:20.140> been

been solved by the way since I've been

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.220

the<00:02:32.930> next<00:02:33.140> weeks<00:02:33.349> and<00:02:33.530> months<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.010> also<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.879> my

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the next weeks and months and also in my

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.619 
the next weeks and months and also in my
kitchen

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
kitchen

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.479 
kitchen
much<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.290> dismay<00:02:36.409> of<00:02:36.620> my<00:02:36.860> wife<00:02:38.170> however

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
much to the dismay of my wife however

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.759 
much to the dismay of my wife however
after<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.519> few<00:02:40.579> failed<00:02:40.970> prototypes<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.930> finally

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
after a few failed prototypes I finally

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.080 
after a few failed prototypes I finally
came<00:02:42.980> up<00:02:43.129> with<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.540> lifesaver<00:02:44.989> bottle

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
came up with this the lifesaver bottle

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.940 
came up with this the lifesaver bottle
okay<00:02:47.090> now<00:02:47.269> for<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.450> science<00:02:47.930> bit<00:02:48.200> before

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
okay now for the science bit before

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.679 
okay now for the science bit before
lifesaver<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.640> best<00:02:49.849> hand<00:02:50.180> filters<00:02:50.569> were

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
lifesaver the best hand filters were

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.449 
lifesaver the best hand filters were
only<00:02:50.840> capable<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.409> filtering<00:02:51.650> down<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.280> about

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
only capable of filtering down to about

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.860 
only capable of filtering down to about
200<00:02:53.180> nanometers<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> smallest<00:02:55.489> bacteria<00:02:56.299> is

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
200 nanometers the smallest bacteria is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.430 
200 nanometers the smallest bacteria is
about<00:02:57.440> 200<00:02:58.069> nanometers<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.049> 200<00:03:00.049> nanometer

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
about 200 nanometers so 200 nanometer

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.949 
about 200 nanometers so 200 nanometer
bacteria<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.129> going<00:03:01.639> to<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:01.909> through<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.450> turn

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
bacteria is going to get through a turn

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.830 
bacteria is going to get through a turn
to<00:03:03.079> nanometer<00:03:03.500> hole<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.790> smallest<00:03:05.090> virus<00:03:05.689> on

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
to nanometer hole the smallest virus on

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.300 
to nanometer hole the smallest virus on
the<00:03:05.870> other<00:03:06.049> hand<00:03:06.349> is<00:03:06.590> about<00:03:07.370> 25<00:03:08.329> nanometers<00:03:09.310> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the other hand is about 25 nanometers so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.559 
the other hand is about 25 nanometers so
that's<00:03:10.459> definitely<00:03:10.760> going<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.329> through

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
that's definitely going to get through

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.819 
that's definitely going to get through
those<00:03:11.750> 200<00:03:12.349> nanometer<00:03:12.799> holes<00:03:14.530> lifesaver<00:03:15.530> paws

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
those 200 nanometer holes lifesaver paws

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.069 
those 200 nanometer holes lifesaver paws
are<00:03:16.659> 15<00:03:17.659> nanometers<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.810> nothing's<00:03:20.810> getting

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
are 15 nanometers so nothing's getting

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.890 
are 15 nanometers so nothing's getting
through<00:03:22.780> okay

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
through okay

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.970 
through okay
I'm<00:03:23.959> going<00:03:24.409> to<00:03:24.470> give<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.709> bit<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:24.859> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
I'm going to give you a bit of a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.319 
I'm going to give you a bit of a
demonstration<00:03:25.160> would<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.699> like<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.970> see<00:03:26.120> that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
demonstration would you like to see that

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.210 
demonstration would you like to see that
I<00:03:26.569> spent<00:03:27.199> all<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.379> time<00:03:27.560> setting<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:27.980> up<00:03:28.160> so

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
I spent all the time setting this up so

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.729 
I spent all the time setting this up so
I<00:03:28.400> guess<00:03:28.639> I<00:03:28.760> should<00:03:29.109> we're<00:03:30.109> in<00:03:30.199> the<00:03:30.260> fine<00:03:30.470> city

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
I guess I should we're in the fine city

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.879 
I guess I should we're in the fine city
of<00:03:30.889> Oxford<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.970> someone's<00:03:32.900> done<00:03:33.109> that<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.379> fine

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
of Oxford so someone's done that up fine

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.439 
of Oxford so someone's done that up fine
CD<00:03:34.129> boxes<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:34.549> what<00:03:34.669> I've<00:03:34.760> done<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.180> I've<00:03:35.299> gone

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
CD boxes so what I've done is I've gone

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.119 
CD boxes so what I've done is I've gone
and<00:03:35.569> got<00:03:35.629> some<00:03:35.870> water<00:03:35.900> from<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> river<00:03:36.829> sure

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
and got some water from the river sure

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.089 
and got some water from the river sure
well<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:38.449> river<00:03:38.690> temps<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.889> flow

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
well and the river temps that flow

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.099 
well and the river temps that flow
through<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.609> this<00:03:40.699> is<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.909> water<00:03:41.079> but<00:03:42.079> I

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
through here and this is the water but I

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.170 
through here and this is the water but I
got<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.470> thinking<00:03:42.889> you<00:03:43.069> know<00:03:43.609> if<00:03:43.819> we<00:03:44.030> were<00:03:44.150> in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
got to thinking you know if we were in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.500 
got to thinking you know if we were in
the<00:03:44.329> middle<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.840> flood<00:03:45.379> zone<00:03:45.409> in<00:03:46.510> Bangladesh

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.930 
the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh
the<00:03:48.049> water<00:03:48.230> wouldn't<00:03:48.560> look<00:03:48.650> like<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.940> so

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
the water wouldn't look like this so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.430 
the water wouldn't look like this so
I've<00:03:50.030> got<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.269> got<00:03:50.389> some<00:03:50.599> stuff<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.019> add<00:03:51.139> into

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
I've got to got some stuff to add into

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.640 
I've got to got some stuff to add into
it<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.769> is<00:03:51.919> from<00:03:52.069> my<00:03:52.250> pond<00:03:52.549> Oh<00:03:53.620> have<00:03:54.620> a
