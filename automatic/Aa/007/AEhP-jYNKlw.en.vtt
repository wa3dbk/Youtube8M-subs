but I don't want to say them because I

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.510 
but I don't want to say them because I
feel<00:05:39.660> that<00:05:39.840> if<00:05:40.020> I<00:05:40.200> do<00:05:40.260> say<00:05:40.770> them<00:05:40.800> there<00:05:41.310> are

gonna<00:05:41.760> be<00:05:41.850> those<00:05:42.210> people<00:05:42.240> who<00:05:42.900> kind<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.470> just

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
gonna be those people who kind of just

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.280 
gonna be those people who kind of just
take<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.130> mick<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.490> break<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.270> rules<00:05:45.510> so

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
take the mick and break the rules so

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.530 
take the mick and break the rules so
it's<00:05:47.100> best<00:05:47.370> that<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.610> probably<00:05:47.910> keep<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.360> as<00:05:48.450> a

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
it's best that I probably keep it as a

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.660 
it's best that I probably keep it as a
secret<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:49.170> then<00:05:49.350> if<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.620> does<00:05:49.830> occur<00:05:50.130> in<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
secret and then if it does occur in the

secret and then if it does occur in the
open<00:05:50.910> lobby<00:05:51.090> i'll<00:05:51.480> probably<00:05:51.870> just<00:05:52.020> say<00:05:52.380> it

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
open lobby i'll probably just say it

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.760 
open lobby i'll probably just say it

though we will be recording but that
doesn't<00:05:56.190> necessarily<00:05:56.400> mean<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.120> it's<00:05:57.420> going

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
doesn't necessarily mean that it's going
