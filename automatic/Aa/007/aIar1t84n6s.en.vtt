00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
for this specific event we considered it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.150 
for this specific event we considered it
a<00:03:46.840> training<00:03:47.170> ground<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.710> did<00:03:47.920> everything

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
a training ground so we did everything

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.800 
a training ground so we did everything
kind<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.550> on<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.670> grander<00:03:49.120> scale<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.750> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
kind of on a grander scale there's a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.510 
kind of on a grander scale there's a
little<00:03:49.930> bit<00:03:50.110> more<00:03:50.260> mellow<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:51.070> athlete<00:03:51.400> has

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
little bit more mellow the athlete has

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.280 
little bit more mellow the athlete has
to<00:03:51.670> do<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.000> more<00:03:52.180> work<00:03:52.390> but<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.810> allows

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
to do a little more work but that allows

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.810 
to do a little more work but that allows
people<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.770> are<00:03:53.890> still<00:03:54.100> up<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.370> coming<00:03:54.700> to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
people that are still up and coming to

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.130 
people that are still up and coming to
start<00:03:55.090> practicing<00:03:55.270> some<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.900> tricks<00:03:56.020> they

rewarding<00:05:54.289> nowadays<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.620> level<00:05:55.919> of<00:05:56.039> tricks

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
rewarding nowadays the level of tricks

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.490 
rewarding nowadays the level of tricks
in<00:05:57.060> both<00:05:57.240> skiing<00:05:57.600> and<00:05:57.810> snowboarding<00:05:58.080> is

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
in both skiing and snowboarding is

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.870 
in both skiing and snowboarding is
absolutely<00:05:59.009> through<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.280> roof<00:05:59.550> so<00:05:59.789> you

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
absolutely through the roof so you

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.520 
absolutely through the roof so you
really<00:06:00.180> need<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.389> safe<00:06:00.690> environment<00:06:01.020> where<00:06:01.470> you

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
really need a safe environment where you

can shred some safe jumps to learn the

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.430 
can shred some safe jumps to learn the
tricks<00:06:04.020> we're<00:06:04.199> working<00:06:04.470> on<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:06.199> think<00:06:07.199> this<00:06:07.289> is

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
tricks we're working on I think this is

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.040 
tricks we're working on I think this is
definitely<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:08.039> future<00:06:08.460> for<00:06:08.970> rocks<00:06:09.389> are<00:06:09.660> just

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
definitely the future for rocks are just

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.080 
definitely the future for rocks are just
