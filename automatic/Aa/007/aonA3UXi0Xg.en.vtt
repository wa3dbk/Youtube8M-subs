00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this in so haven't even had a chance to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
this in so haven't even had a chance to
really<00:01:08.189> test<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.640> yet<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.580> looks<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
really test it yet but looks like it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.649 
really test it yet but looks like it
will<00:01:12.659> fit<00:01:13.610> most<00:01:14.610> shoes<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> course<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
will fit most shoes and of course you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.770 
will fit most shoes and of course you
want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> wear<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.670> pretty<00:01:17.670> much<00:01:17.880> parallel<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
want to wear it pretty much parallel to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.679 
want to wear it pretty much parallel to
everything<00:01:19.320> else<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> package<00:01:22.049> got<00:01:23.540> there<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
everything else the package got there it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.050 
everything else the package got there it
is<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> flashing

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.850 

so<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.720> got<00:01:32.870> a<00:01:32.900> really<00:01:33.140> good<00:01:33.380> pulse<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:34.040> it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
so it's got a really good pulse to it

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.530 
so it's got a really good pulse to it
and<00:01:36.860> if<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.340> press<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.580> again<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.150> shuts<00:01:38.390> it

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
and if you press it again it shuts it

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.650 
and if you press it again it shuts it
off<00:01:39.490> I'm<00:01:40.490> not<00:01:40.550> going<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.880> open<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.330> package
