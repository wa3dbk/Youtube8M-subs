00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.899
 so hi to all today we 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.109
 make a presentation of comics love 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.030
 so the latest from huawei then 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 we can be that this is the model 32 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.080
 gigabytes find directly on 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.960
 internet on amazon for a price of 200 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 euros roughly extensive with micro sd 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.619
 support is several times my 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 different so you do a little bit 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.869
 topo of this pmp so on the buttons here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.900
 we have botton to back down for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 move forward here sorry if the quality is a 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 little naze 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.200
 here is the play button here so we 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.480
 have a cash is that I come to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.020
 the shelter then sees what we can see 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 so here the port to load and send 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 the music and here the card reader 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.469
 microsd or do I have one 2 64 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 giga on the buttons at the top so we 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.369
 find the volume to lower us 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.180
 button to increase the volume 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.330
 and if the power button so at the level of 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.490
 the interface without which with him these 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.320
 amateurs so the themes for the s 300 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.049
 for the j3 for the s9 and luxury aids are 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.119
 compatible and that one 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.150
 if not to say at the level of thickness 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.049
 the interface is active there is nothing to say 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.670
 just a little bit at the screen 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.950
 unfortunately it's not always too 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 very reactive you have a capacitive screen 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.820
 and ps so to touch it's not 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 really very fun 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 so good it instructed so that's the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 new interface so here as we 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 can see music video pictures radio 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.240
 do not forget that radio is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.579
 necessarily that your helmet here for 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.490
 record the voice the options which 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.470
 among the options a lot of options 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.509
 the audio the display the time the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.060
 musical settings the system 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.009
 voice recording 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.329
 so here you can see several 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.329
 equalizer taken into account 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.590
 so at one point I then tried to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.910
 him to the concerned blur 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.360
 parra it went for example here this is 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.850
 not easy 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 so here but personal equalizer 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 so compared to the school isere baby 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.910
 which is the professional effects of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.270
 code with respect to audio so here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.850
 magic 3d cirad lesson to increase 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.170
 tracks on the treble and serious 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.430
 the baby so what is professional 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.570
 that I disabled because with the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.640
 headphones that I have high-end is not 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.390
 really very useful equalizer by 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.490
 frequency ratio 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.630
 so it's already much more complete than this 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.510
 that can be done in the market in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 trade already in most pmp 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.780
 so here according to kind you listen to this 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.910
 little black currant hero that results 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.300
 be better or worse but the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.690
 better anyway will always remain 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.400
 those basic good then not relative 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.380
 interface as says it's personal 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 I put the own interface so 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.680
 it does not look like this at all 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.360
 so here it is to jacques is present of the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.560
 cd i can move back music 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.190
 directly on the touch screen as 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.810
 on the buttons then at the level of 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.390
 the interface to its interfaces that I have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.370
 installed so compatible 2g ramon of 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.870
 the esa and claude jitrois the s9 the vix is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.100
 usually have to take some loÃ¯c 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.480
 ceyte because it's exactly the same 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.250
 base this one except it does not have a disk 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.290
 hard integrated gold 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.290
 so at the music level 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.739
 there I was walking the speakers to 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.090
 the back so he is much more 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.880
 therefore is much more powerful than 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.880
 that of j3 nothing to say 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.350
 at the level of the power of the sound 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.920
 I would give about the same as a 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.920
 cellphone 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.330
 so at the level of the screen at the level of 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.890
 quality to the material not even 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.600
 watch movies did not let go like 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.100
 we can see on the phones we 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:19.390
 are it's 480 of 272 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.220
 so it's something very , very 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.020
 high but let's say that good the goal 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.270
 first this device is especially of 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.390
 side of the music so we're not going 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.390
 complain 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.540
 so here the file explorer so 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.680
 here is roger map to escautpont that the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.540
 perspective in there so here all the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.830
 styles all before I own 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.050
 we'll say is that the closet 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.360
 frankly the colonies take in 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.060
 Apple's charge the wave wave not that the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.200
 p4 to it's halal I do not know he's me 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.840
 seems that after the last 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.919
 updates and supports it 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.570
 but the best is still the 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.010
 flag for audio quality if at least 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.930
 we have a high-end headphones after 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.090
 it's vexing to take the place and we are 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.950
 stayed about 17 gigabytes 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.230
 the 32 gigas of the coup I put everything 64 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.140
 giga pretty much the ones I saw that 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.580
 I have 2800 music so that's it 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.140
 takes up space we can do some 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.340
 playlists in any case I for 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.850
 home without it being possible 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.590
 alone 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.180
 we can make several young people and at 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.040
 qg not tried this option yet 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.070
 so here are artists album album any 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.070
 is categorized good among the tags to 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.580
 every time as I said it's a little 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.900
 galley what for example is enough that I 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.610
 part of it is that we are several 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.510
 featurings bah voila what that but the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 music time records act 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.870
 writing ring so that's a little silly 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.870
 what is not it is not very 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.280
 cool I really sorry at that the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.169
 video sowed blur in each case with these 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
 I'm really going away 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.400
 sorry but it's my phone has to 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.690
 to have psychs as he always does 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.080
 turn alternative roms 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.370
 there is a little capricious so here is 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.570
 it was a brief presentation like 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.330
 in that most people who the 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.180
 test on the internet 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.729
 they are more or to say English or 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.259
 Russian is still Korean 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.800
 it's not very easy to make a 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.939
 idea about a product that is not really 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.770
 therefore necessarily translates 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.000
 advice if you ever buy it at 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.919
 first start I'm going to ask you 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.229
 in which area you live mostly 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.789
 do not choose europe or france because 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.050
 that camilla standards on her the sound is going 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.460
 to be restrained and frankly seen the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.120
 product power and quality 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.650
 audio 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.759
 it will be a little con the brider so here it is 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.110
 so that was the end of this 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.610
 product presentation and so I hope 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.080
 it really did not please you anymore 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.940
 first that I do so if it makes a 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.219
 little novice you really see me 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.669
 sorry and that's it so I can you 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.590
 advisor 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.300
 I can strongly advise you in everything 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.650
 case avoid taking apple all because 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.599
 only in terms of product quality 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.129
 it's true it's good it's design 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.190
 all this but frankly is what 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.930
 it wants to cut 200 balls in a b3 case 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.849
 than 8 or 16 gigabyts then that one is in 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.560
 purchase 32 we can add 30 of 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.639
 audio autonomy frankly I 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.909
 recharge once both 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.310
 weeks 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.629
 hundred and ten hours in audio and yet my 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.090
 case what they consume and the music 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.069
 it also consumes so really so 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.389
 you want audio quality I you 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.680
 do not recommend going to apple especially 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.210
 when we really discover music 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.409
 with a good helmet 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.599
 it would be the worst as business gets 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:13.250
 do not half apple but at least I 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.839
 you warn we have very good ep 4 on 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.180
 market but I think that among the 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.680
 sound level and that it is creative 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.719
 finally all that is Korean pretty much 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.909
 at the audio level on the directory not 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:25.339
 necessarily samsung by your message 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.539
 personal envoy so that's so it's 

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:28.610
 the end of my video and I hope that 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.819
 you liked it and then good you were months 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.819
 day
