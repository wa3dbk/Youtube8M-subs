going to do you're going to leave one
straight<00:00:14.179> completely<00:00:14.809> straight<00:00:15.169> and<00:00:16.330> take<00:00:17.330> a

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
straight completely straight and take a

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.460 
straight completely straight and take a

the end and then mold it to your
toothpick<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.980> reason<00:00:25.310> why<00:00:25.460> I'm<00:00:25.640> doing<00:00:25.670> that

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
toothpick the reason why I'm doing that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.170 
toothpick the reason why I'm doing that
is<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:26.980> once<00:00:27.980> this<00:00:28.190> will<00:00:28.370> be<00:00:28.550> dry<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:29.030> going

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
is that once this will be dry it's going

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.360 
is that once this will be dry it's going
to<00:00:29.240> be<00:00:29.420> way<00:00:29.630> simpler<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.470> just<00:00:30.500> stick<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.160> to

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
to be way simpler to just stick it to

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.220 
to be way simpler to just stick it to
your<00:00:31.730> other<00:00:32.329> piece<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:32.780> we're<00:00:33.050> going<00:00:33.170> to

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
your other piece that we're going to

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.400 
your other piece that we're going to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
create in a minute and then for this one

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.930 
create in a minute and then for this one
take<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.040> toothpick<00:00:37.640> wet<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:38.690> again<00:00:39.640> but<00:00:40.640> this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
take a toothpick wet it again but this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.000 
take a toothpick wet it again but this
one<00:00:41.270> because<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.960> were<00:00:42.260> going<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.739> create

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
want flatten the inside but you don't

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.310 
want flatten the inside but you don't
want<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.280> lose<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.729> shape<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.710> shoe

and then a smaller round in the middle

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.199 
and then a smaller round in the middle
once<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.629> cut<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> middle<00:02:28.260> part<00:02:28.560> use<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.280> round

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
once you cut the middle part use a round

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.509 
once you cut the middle part use a round
tool<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:33.120> smooth<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:35.310> edges

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
tool like this and then smooth the edges

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:52.580 
tool like this and then smooth the edges
by<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.810> back<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.440> forth

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.850 

good

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860

and create couple of these fresh a
little<00:03:35.930> bit<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.170> water<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.830> then<00:03:38.200> ludus<00:03:39.200> all

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
little bit of water and then ludus all

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:50.410 
little bit of water and then ludus all
the<00:03:40.580> way<00:03:40.670> around

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.840 

if<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.080> pieces<00:03:51.350> don't<00:03:51.740> meet<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.340> doesn't

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
if the pieces don't meet it doesn't

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.260 
if the pieces don't meet it doesn't
really<00:03:53.680> matter<00:03:57.430> because<00:03:58.430> then<00:03:58.760> you'll<00:03:58.940> start

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
really matter because then you'll start

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.530 
really matter because then you'll start
your<00:03:59.510> other<00:03:59.840> piece<00:04:00.520> where<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:02.780> didn't<00:04:03.080> meet

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
your other piece where they didn't meet

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.560 
your other piece where they didn't meet
so<00:04:05.540> once<00:04:05.750> you've<00:04:05.959> glued<00:04:06.110> your<00:04:06.530> first<00:04:07.010> one<00:04:07.570> then

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
so once you've glued your first one then

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.949 
so once you've glued your first one then
you're<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:10.390> glue<00:04:11.680> your<00:04:12.680> second<00:04:13.250> piece

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
you're going to glue your second piece

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:22.610 
you're going to glue your second piece
on<00:04:15.190> top<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.549> your<00:04:16.820> first<00:04:17.090> piece

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.370 

and<00:04:23.280> you're<00:04:23.490> going<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.699> continue<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.630> layers

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
and you're going to continue in layers

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:37.790 
and you're going to continue in layers
all<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.400> way<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.580> about<00:04:27.210> almost<00:04:27.840> here

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:05:17.640 

you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.760

roll out some blue fondant big enough to

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.790 
roll out some blue fondant big enough to
hide<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.790> top<00:05:22.000> part<00:05:22.389> but<00:05:22.600> not<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.380> entire

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
piece and create some little interest

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.860 
piece and create some little interest
and<00:05:39.940> fold<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:40.990> sides<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:43.389> it<00:05:43.510> looks<00:05:43.720> like

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
and fold the sides so that it looks like

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:54.270 
and fold the sides so that it looks like

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
it's a a dress like that and then at the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.140 
it's a a dress like that and then at the
bottom<00:05:54.490> here<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:55.600> can<00:05:55.780> actually<00:05:56.020> hide<00:05:56.680> this

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
bottom here you can actually hide this

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.610 
bottom here you can actually hide this
especially<00:05:58.150> depending<00:05:58.690> on<00:05:59.110> how<00:05:59.350> you're<00:05:59.530> going

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
especially depending on how you're going

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.320 
especially depending on how you're going
to<00:05:59.710> glue<00:05:59.919> this<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.280> your<00:06:00.430> cake<00:06:00.760> if<00:06:01.000> you're

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
gluing it on the side it doesn't really

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.210 
gluing it on the side it doesn't really
matter<00:06:03.729> but<00:06:04.600> if<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:05.110> are<00:06:05.440> gluing<00:06:05.800> it<00:06:05.919> like

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
matter but if you are gluing it like

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.860 
matter but if you are gluing it like

that at the top you don't want to see

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.060 
that at the top you don't want to see
this<00:06:08.130> so<00:06:09.130> it's<00:06:09.280> better<00:06:09.490> to<00:06:09.669> maybe<00:06:10.919> put<00:06:11.919> the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
this so it's better to maybe put the
