00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 in europe park is the largest 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.009
 amusement park in germany and one of the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.029
 most successful in europe with over 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.029
 other attractions 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 at the new attraction wool da vinci 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 For the first time we have a lot of new ones 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.399
 because it uses technology from siemens 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.940
 The plant has been running for a year and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.940
 trouble-free 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.790
 60 via wireless that was new for us 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.900
 especially in the field of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.989
 passenger transport 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.210
 I was a bit skeptical about it at the beginning 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.530
 because normally on 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.940
 safety-relevant options rada moderately 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.650
 must be designed in the control 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.890
 area but that you understand most 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.890
 not her 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.380
 the requirements of the network and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.110
 the automation technology is full and there 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.850
 Vincent were the reliability we were 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.060
 Realize by a very reliable 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.980
 roaming on a solution with rapper too 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 can be used in the car sector 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.540
 because the component are suitable for 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.870
 the range from minus 20 to plus 60 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.870
 Degree 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.500
 the special thing about this solution is that 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.750
 We through the use of one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 special line ergo bugs and report 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.200
 roaming for real-time transmission 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 profinet and bridges shepherd possible 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.130
 the siemens solution bring us 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.290
 cost advantages in maintenance and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 expect the solution via profinet and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 16 via wifi is complete and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.290
 responsibility 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
 We will also be wireless in the future 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.030
 Investments for our new attraction 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.890
 In 2014 we are working closely again 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.030
 siemens together and we are right 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 are satisfied with the dad
