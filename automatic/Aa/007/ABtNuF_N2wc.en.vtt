 infinity now you can see it I want 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.510
 ask a quick question in this 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.060
 these cars where you have them because 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.910
 take you there in some areas of the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.050
 city and fears these cases are robbed 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.330
 Everyday use from time to time you know that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.950
 they do not fit the things of the errand in 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 Grandoli on a motorbike I do not say good as there is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 to carry the stroller but not ground 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.490
 occupy it a lot is very little what I use it 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.960
 well there is my new best friend with 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.780
 that we're going insurance 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
 party and will teach us right now not a 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.920
 one of the interesting things that has 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.270
 is this great ship yes, of course 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.310
 I'm going to make art what it does more than 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.660
 nothing in the air expression and you can 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.660
 see it with the camera everything else 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 and that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.500
 my life 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.590
 I'm still at the expo tunning party and 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.050
 see a solution for all these evils 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 at the moment we went out at the party and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.490
 that no longer fit the chelas or the party 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.500
 see this fabulous idea I from 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.700
 This moment can be nominated as the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.210
 idea is not the year of the century 21st century 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 gentlemen there was just the fridge and 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.530
 dream the real ones are really full 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.150
 are real chelas are chelas of 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.290
 true or this is it is practically 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.300
 functional 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.680
 I want to propose to the nobel who 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.620
 invented this I want problem for the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.160
 nobel immediately you proposed it 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.440
 here we have it fast 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.420
 I want to propose what is for the nobel 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.310
 because I think it's going to save our lives 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.770
 Many 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.170
 yes now so it was an idea for 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.260
 take the hole this from there to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.700

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.700

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.790
 of the event

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.760
 they arrange each one there is something different 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.489
 time each one has different things is 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.449
