00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to just put the ice there you can see

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
to just put the ice there you can see
this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.399> cropping<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.750> zoom<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.140> using<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this is cropping I can zoom in using a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.399 
this is cropping I can zoom in using a
pinching<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.159> zooming<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.810> little

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
pinching and zooming I can do a little

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.760 
pinching and zooming I can do a little
drawing<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.430> example<00:02:05.790> i<00:02:05.820> won<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.360> little

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
drawing for example i won a little

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.729 
drawing of my
maybe<00:02:09.780> disc<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.800> draw<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.290> can<00:02:13.290> increase

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
maybe disc and draw this I can increase

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.000 
maybe disc and draw this I can increase
the<00:02:13.950> size<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> pen<00:02:15.629> size<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.290> ink<00:02:16.500> block

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the size of the pen size the ink block

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.390 
the size of the pen size the ink block
so<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.730> looks<00:02:18.000> much<00:02:18.480> larger<00:02:19.110> no<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.920> TV<00:02:20.069> do

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
so it looks much larger no to do TV do

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
so it looks much larger no to do TV do
you<00:02:20.430> know<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.300> actually<00:02:21.480> very<00:02:21.750> very<00:02:22.050> smooth

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
you know it's actually very very smooth

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.369 
you know it's actually very very smooth
and<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.550> even<00:02:23.790> draw<00:02:24.629> as<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
and you can even draw as you like

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.280 
and you can even draw as you like
you<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.860> draw<00:02:26.069> shapes<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.269> do<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.900> that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you can draw shapes you can do like that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710 
you can draw shapes you can do like that
she'll<00:02:28.500> Joker<00:02:28.860> fit<00:02:29.129> frame<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.390> course<00:02:30.660> you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
she'll Joker fit frame and of course you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.729 
she'll Joker fit frame and of course you
can<00:02:30.900> draw<00:02:31.140> circles<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:33.739> draw

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
can draw circles and I can draw

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.940 
can draw circles and I can draw
triangles<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:36.030> also<00:02:36.390> write<00:02:37.319> text<00:02:37.799> for

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
triangles you can also write text for

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.880 
triangles you can also write text for
example<00:02:39.470> maybe<00:02:40.940> let's<00:02:41.940> see<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:45.239> me<00:02:45.860> no<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
example maybe let's see this is me no I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.520 
example maybe let's see this is me no I
just<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.329> it's<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.660> edgy<00:02:48.959> create

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
just right it's like edgy create

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
just right it's like edgy create
diagrams<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.790> draw<00:02:51.150> diagrams

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
diagrams and just draw diagrams

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.319 
diagrams and just draw diagrams
accordingly<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.370> insert<00:02:53.790> into<00:02:54.000> the

accordingly and that be insert into the

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.319 
accordingly and that be insert into the
image<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.530> also<00:02:55.680> undo<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.430> well<00:02:56.670> let<00:02:57.180> me

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
