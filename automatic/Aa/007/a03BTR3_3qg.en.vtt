00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
this will show one more way on how to

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.690 
this will show one more way on how to
make<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> yarn<00:00:03.510> pom<00:00:04.020> pom<00:00:04.400> you<00:00:05.400> will<00:00:05.549> need

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
make a yarn pom pom you will need

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.309 
make a yarn pom pom you will need
something<00:00:05.940> heavy-duty<00:00:06.480> like<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> piece<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
something heavy-duty like a piece of

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.160 
something heavy-duty like a piece of
cardboard<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:08.599> going<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.809> cutting<00:00:10.019> out

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
cardboard I'm going to be cutting out

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.730 
cardboard I'm going to be cutting out
two<00:00:10.230> pieces<00:00:10.740> I'm<00:00:11.990> going<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> show<00:00:13.349> how<00:00:13.590> it's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
two pieces I'm going to show how it's

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829 
two pieces I'm going to show how it's
done<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.250> piece<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> paper<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.719> what

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
done on this piece of paper and what

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.990 
done on this piece of paper and what
I've<00:00:15.960> done<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.379> traced<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.859> larger<00:00:17.310> circle<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
I've done is traced a larger circle and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.609 
I've done is traced a larger circle and
then<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> center<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.410> smaller<00:00:19.890> circle<00:00:21.619> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
then in the center a smaller circle and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:39.530 
then in the center a smaller circle and
you<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.980> cut<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.340> out<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:36.559> then<00:00:38.329> cut<00:00:39.329> down

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
you just cut it out and then cut down

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.650 
you just cut it out and then cut down
the<00:00:39.719> center<00:00:40.820> cut<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> circle<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the center cut out the circle in the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:55.790 
the center cut out the circle in the
center<00:00:53.300> now<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> found<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> take

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
center now I found that I like to take

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.819 
center now I found that I like to take
and<00:00:56.070> cut<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.510> V<00:00:57.809> notch<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> top

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and cut out a little V notch to the top

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
and cut out a little V notch to the top
and<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.250> makes<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> yarn<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.210> through<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and this makes the yarn going through a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
and this makes the yarn going through a
little<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.199> easier<00:01:03.559> now<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
little bit easier now this is how you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
little bit easier now this is how you
wrap<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.360> grab<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> hold<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
wrap it on it just grab a hold of it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
wrap it on it just grab a hold of it
like<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.729> then<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.060> slides<00:01:09.420> right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
like that then it just slides right

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.760 
like that then it just slides right
through<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> center<00:01:10.439> V<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> keep

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
through the center V and you keep

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.920 
through the center V and you keep
wrapping<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.340> around<00:01:14.460> evenly<00:01:20.509> don't<00:01:21.509> wrap<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
wrapping it around evenly don't wrap the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
wrapping it around evenly don't wrap the
yarn<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:22.409> tight<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.520> difficult

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
yarn too tight or it will be difficult

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:41.370 
yarn too tight or it will be difficult
to<00:01:24.180> cut

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.529 

I'm<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.130> little<00:01:42.310> further<00:01:42.490> along<00:01:42.700> with<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.299> one

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
I'm a little further along with this one

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.690 
I'm a little further along with this one
and<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.899> can<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.229> it's<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.530> larger<00:01:44.920> size<00:01:45.159> so

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and you can see it's a larger size so

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.920 
and you can see it's a larger size so
you<00:01:45.789> can<00:01:45.880> make<00:01:46.119> any<00:01:46.299> size<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.899> want<00:01:47.079> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:15.390 

and<00:01:52.930> continue<00:01:53.350> wrapping<00:01:53.740> I<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:15.040> cut<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and continue wrapping I have cut the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.339 
and continue wrapping I have cut the
previous<00:02:15.849> color<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.180> was<00:02:16.480> working<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:17.049> and

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349

I'm<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> let<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> hang<00:02:18.610> right

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
I'm just going to let it hang right

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.890 
I'm just going to let it hang right
there<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:20.019> can<00:02:20.200> trim<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.440> up<00:02:20.590> later<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.780> I'm

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
there you can trim it up later now I'm

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.390 
there you can trim it up later now I'm
going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.260> add<00:02:23.380> another<00:02:23.590> color<00:02:26.130> let's<00:02:27.130> start

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
pull the cardboard off that's another

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.570 
pull the cardboard off that's another
way<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.310> creating<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.910> yarn<00:04:32.180> pom<00:04:32.450> pom<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:34.430> can

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
way of creating a yarn pom pom you can

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.280 
way of creating a yarn pom pom you can
trim<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.820> up<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.180> shape<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.600> or<00:04:35.720> leave<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.020> how

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
trim it up and shape it or leave it how

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.070 
trim it up and shape it or leave it how
it<00:04:36.320> is

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
it is
