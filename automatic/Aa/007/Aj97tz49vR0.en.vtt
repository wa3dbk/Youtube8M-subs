also called my beer room this is the
base<00:00:12.990> photograph<00:00:13.759> two<00:00:14.759> days<00:00:14.910> ago<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> found<00:00:15.480> the

base photograph two days ago I found the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920 
base photograph two days ago I found the
second<00:00:16.020> photograph<00:00:16.490> similar<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.930> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
second photograph similar to this the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.570 
second photograph similar to this the
only<00:00:19.109> difference<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
only difference is that in this

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
only difference is that in this
photograph<00:00:23.300> it<00:00:24.300> reveals<00:00:24.660> coordinates<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
photograph it reveals coordinates on the

photograph it reveals coordinates on the
bottom<00:00:26.449> this<00:00:27.449> photograph<00:00:27.960> was<00:00:27.990> taken<00:00:28.170> off<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.500 

coordinates<00:00:36.900> are<00:00:37.940> can't<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.090> come<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> on

56<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> thought<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.990> myself<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.560> I<00:00:49.680> were<00:00:49.830> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
56 now I thought to myself if I were to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.250 
56 now I thought to myself if I were to
take<00:00:50.070> these<00:00:50.220> same<00:00:50.460> coordinates<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.260> plug

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
take these same coordinates and plug

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
take these same coordinates and plug
them<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:53.390> google<00:00:54.390> earth<00:00:54.540> sky<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.400> may

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
them into google earth sky if I may

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
them into google earth sky if I may
possibly<00:00:57.150> get<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.450> same<00:00:57.660> image<00:00:58.070> seeing<00:00:59.070> how

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
possibly get the same image seeing how

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
possibly get the same image seeing how
that<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.520> images<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.240> taking<00:01:00.630> in<00:01:00.750> taken

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that these images we're taking in taken

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.450 
that these images we're taking in taken
in<00:01:01.700> 2007<00:01:03.199> around<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.559> period<00:01:04.890> right

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in 2007 around that time period right

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
in 2007 around that time period right
after<00:01:05.490> the<00:01:06.210> South<00:01:06.540> Pole<00:01:06.720> telescope<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.320> first

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
after the South Pole telescope was first

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.910 
after the South Pole telescope was first
opened<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.580> google<00:01:09.479> earth<00:01:09.600> sky<00:01:09.960> originated

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
opened and google earth sky originated

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.560 
opened and google earth sky originated
in<00:01:11.540> 2007<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.690> thought<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.740> might<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:13.890> some

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
in 2007 I thought there might be some

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
in 2007 I thought there might be some
possible<00:01:15.570> similarities<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.410> pictures<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
possible similarities in the pictures so

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
possible similarities in the pictures so
let<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.760> just<00:01:17.880> open<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.270> Google<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.690> here<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
let me just open up Google if here and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.550 
let me just open up Google if here and
I'll<00:01:19.470> show<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.800> what<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> found

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.389 

now<00:01:25.159> if<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.549> go<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.729> view<00:01:27.189> explore<00:01:28.189> and

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
now if we just go to view explore and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.110 
now if we just go to view explore and
switch<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.790> sky

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.530 

now<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:32.080> took<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.770> same<00:01:33.010> coordinates<00:01:33.550> if<00:01:34.390> it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
now I took the same coordinates if it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.120 
now I took the same coordinates if it
will<00:01:34.690> show<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.930> here<00:01:37.230> five<00:01:38.230> hours<00:01:38.620> 43<00:01:38.860> minutes

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
will show you here five hours 43 minutes

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.300 
will show you here five hours 43 minutes
27<00:01:39.790> seconds<00:01:40.270> negative<00:01:41.110> six<00:01:41.350> 1058<00:01:42.660> now<00:01:43.660> i<00:01:44.310> will

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
27 seconds negative six 1058 now i will

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.510 
27 seconds negative six 1058 now i will
take<00:01:45.460> those<00:01:45.640> coordinates

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050 

let's<00:01:54.240> begin<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.659> search<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:56.969> you'll

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
let's begin to search and I think you'll

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.200 
let's begin to search and I think you'll
be<00:01:57.090> pretty<00:01:57.390> amazed<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.109> find

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.640 

looks<00:02:04.210> there<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.660> went<00:02:04.840> into<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.080> big<00:02:05.380> big

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
looks there that we went into a big big

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.350 
looks there that we went into a big big
dark<00:02:05.950> hole<00:02:06.190> now<00:02:06.430> as<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:06.970> see<00:02:07.150> there's<00:02:07.300> no

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
dark hole now as you can see there's no

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.910 
dark hole now as you can see there's no
stars<00:02:07.750> around<00:02:08.050> or<00:02:08.229> anything<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.710> image

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
stars around or anything in this image

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.500 
stars around or anything in this image
but<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.060> slowly<00:02:10.660> back<00:02:11.170> out<00:02:12.090> you'll<00:02:13.090> notice

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
but if we slowly back out you'll notice

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.410 
but if we slowly back out you'll notice
that<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:13.900> exact<00:02:14.380> image<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.150> just

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
that in this exact image there was just

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.490 
that in this exact image there was just
a<00:02:16.600> cropped<00:02:17.050> out<00:02:17.350> circle<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.550> swear

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
a cropped out circle and swear

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560 
a cropped out circle and swear
absolutely<00:02:20.500> nothing<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> only

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
absolutely nothing this is the only

there's proof here that this is not just
a<00:02:37.690> fox<00:02:37.930> them<00:02:38.170> as<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.440> see<00:02:38.620> here<00:02:38.860> this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
a fox them as you see here this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.420 
a fox them as you see here this
background<00:02:39.280> star<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.930> star<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.530> cut<00:02:41.860> directly

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
background star the star is cut directly

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.690 
background star the star is cut directly
in<00:02:43.090> half<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.830> up<00:02:44.830> here<00:02:45.010> there's<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.310> little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
in half and up here there's a little

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.350 
in half and up here there's a little
information<00:02:46.060> tab<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.080> click<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.440> it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
information tab and when you click on it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.280 
information tab and when you click on it
comes<00:02:49.360> up<00:02:49.570> I'm<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.870> sure<00:02:50.020> if<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.140> can<00:02:50.200> see

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
comes up I'm not sure if you can see

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.410 
comes up I'm not sure if you can see
that<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.920> says<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.880> don't

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
that but all it says is this I don't

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.160 
that but all it says is this I don't
know<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.810> means<00:02:56.020> i<00:02:56.350> clicked<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.120> but

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
know what this means i clicked on it but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.729 
know what this means i clicked on it but
it<00:02:59.170> went<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.800> dead<00:03:00.310> link<00:03:01.260> well<00:03:02.260> folks<00:03:02.560> that

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
it went to a dead link well folks that

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.610 
it went to a dead link well folks that
you<00:03:02.830> have<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.190> there<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.760> more<00:03:04.000> proof<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
you have it there is more proof that and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.640 
you have it there is more proof that and
I've<00:03:05.769> ever<00:03:06.040> possibly<00:03:06.580> does<00:03:06.820> exist<00:03:07.180> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I've ever possibly does exist and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.100 
I've ever possibly does exist and
there's<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.739> big<00:03:08.920> cover<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:09.280> right<00:03:09.549> now<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.110> but

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
there's a big cover up right now and but

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.400 
there's a big cover up right now and but
where<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.500> me<00:03:11.650> even<00:03:11.860> more<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.760> fact<00:03:13.000> that

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
where is me even more is the fact that

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.070 
where is me even more is the fact that
someone<00:03:14.410> went<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> great<00:03:15.010> extent<00:03:16.080> I'm

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
someone went to the great extent I'm

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.500 
someone went to the great extent I'm
blocking<00:03:17.620> out<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:17.950> image<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:19.450> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
blocking out this image and for the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.360 
blocking out this image and for the
public<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:19.930> what<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.890> possibly

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
public to see what is possibly

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.670 
public to see what is possibly
imminently<00:03:21.790> coming<00:03:22.209> thank<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.290> very<00:03:23.470> much
