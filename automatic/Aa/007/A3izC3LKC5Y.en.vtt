00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.760
 This is the way to put the bowl 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 our colander and put gauze there 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.430
 spreading cheesecloth I have it here at 4 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.790
 we put this sour milk into gauze 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.799
 this serum can be 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.040
 use on cooking pancakes 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.820
 well, or just delete and now without 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.310
 all oppression without anything here it is me 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.689
 I fasten for a very long time I press tight 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.049
 then serum residues and leave 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.750
 drain exactly one night or one 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.850
 day as you want more profitable of course 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 do at night because in the morning you have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 already pretty pretty ready 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 a bowl of delicious cottage cheese and what am I 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.540
 I also want to note that the cottage cheese 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.420
 cooked like this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
 its output in the final result 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.600
 It turns out much more than this: 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.200
 cooked before 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.880
 2 recipes is when the steam bath 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 liquid curd y here is called fromage 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 blanc 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.940
 or fromage free when you water it 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.270
 like a little brewing bath 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.850
 And so milk is just a growth dice 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.830
 vast armed and then collected in 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.170
 another bowl out of that cottage cheese 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.860

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.300
 draining like that but clamping clamping 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.570
 this is all the excess serum it will come out and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.970
 when you could not and slowly from all 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.100

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.030
