like<00:05:31.050> I'm<00:05:31.229> in<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.500> three<00:05:31.740> category<00:05:32.280> if<00:05:32.490> you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
like I'm in the three category if you

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.080 
like I'm in the three category if you
are<00:05:33.030> for<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.630> B<00:05:33.960> or<00:05:34.139> C<00:05:34.470> then<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:35.100> almond<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.699> feel

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
are for a B or C then the almond I feel

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.939 
are for a B or C then the almond I feel
like<00:05:36.300> would<00:05:36.479> be<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.720> better<00:05:36.990> option<00:05:37.260> for<00:05:37.530> you

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.710 
like would be a better option for you
just<00:05:38.460> because<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:39.000> gives<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.360> those<00:05:39.540> extra

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
whipped butter gel doesn't and then if

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.159

I would say to go with the aloe whipped
butter<00:05:58.919> gel<00:05:59.250> because<00:05:59.760> it<00:06:00.270> does<00:06:00.510> give<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:01.080> you

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.270 
gel more so than the almonds are
twisting<00:06:12.750> but<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:12.900> feel<00:06:13.229> like<00:06:13.349> this<00:06:13.740> takes<00:06:14.190> the

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
twisting but I feel like this takes the

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.580 
twisting but I feel like this takes the
cake<00:06:14.370> for<00:06:14.580> me<00:06:15.060> just<00:06:15.630> for<00:06:15.810> my<00:06:15.990> preference

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590
