England<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.159> recent<00:01:14.580> times<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
England in recent times so going over to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
England in recent times so going over to
England<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:17.220> too<00:01:17.280> may<00:01:17.759> somehow<00:01:18.299> bag<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
England they too may somehow bag the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
England they too may somehow bag the
same<00:01:19.140> side<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.500> played<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> last<00:01:20.250> ODI<00:01:20.700> they

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
same side that played the last ODI they

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
same side that played the last ODI they
had<00:01:21.450> made<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.930> change<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.470> Stephan<00:01:22.830> Finn

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
had made one change with Stephan Finn

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.340 
had made one change with Stephan Finn
coming<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.490> place<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.970> Chris<00:01:24.180> Jordan<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
coming in place of Chris Jordan so they

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
coming in place of Chris Jordan so they
should<00:01:25.560> persist<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.640> Finn

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
should persist with that because Finn

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
should persist with that because Finn
looked<00:01:27.390> quite<00:01:27.630> good<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.170> his<00:01:28.530> comeback<00:01:28.799> game

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
looked quite good in his comeback game

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
looked quite good in his comeback game
and<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.090> bowling<00:01:30.570> lineup<00:01:30.930> should

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and the other bowling lineup should

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
and the other bowling lineup should
remain<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.070> James<00:01:32.369> Anderson

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
Treadwell bowling spin then there may be

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
Treadwell bowling spin then there may be
a<00:01:38.130> chance<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> Ben<00:01:38.880> Stokes<00:01:39.240> perhaps<00:01:39.780> making

oh<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> Morgan<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.520> Jos<00:02:02.820> Butler<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
oh and Morgan and Jos Butler are the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
oh and Morgan and Jos Butler are the
main<00:02:04.560> men<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.310> batting<00:02:05.700> lineup<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.210> they

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
main men in this batting lineup as they

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
main men in this batting lineup as they
will<00:02:07.290> provide<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.860> impetus<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.849> England

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
will provide the impetus when England

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.580 
will provide the impetus when England
want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.629> attack<00:02:09.929> India

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
want to attack India

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.869 
want to attack India
so<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.830> would<00:02:10.950> say<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.190> India<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
so one would say that India are the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.759 
so one would say that India are the
favourites<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.810> count<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.290> hosts<00:02:13.620> out

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
favourites but don't count the hosts out

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.040 
favourites but don't count the hosts out
because<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.180> bounce<00:02:15.420> back<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.810> they

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
because they can bounce back as they

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.229 
because they can bounce back as they
have<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.560> very<00:02:17.220> good<00:02:17.340> one-day<00:02:17.970> players

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
have some very good one-day players

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.479 
have some very good one-day players
though<00:02:18.900> there<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.500> some<00:02:19.709> criticism<00:02:20.340> about

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
though there is some criticism about

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.970 
though there is some criticism about
them<00:02:21.060> approach<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> format<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> lot<00:02:22.950> is
