00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 tec shop on the day courses for 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.390
 youtube ers 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.900
 this video is offered by pixar wall-e 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.730
 new era games links in description and there 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 The staff here is the lion and today I came to bring 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.510
 for you a tutorial on how to leave the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.010
 your pc and the faster windows 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.130
 For this you do not need any 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.859
 code of anything of the kind not complicated 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.949
 you only need this program that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.619
 is called the optimal ice and memory 0 to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.930
 advantage is that it is very light it has only 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.739
 a mega for you to download and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 installation is very fast and finally when 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.280
 you open the program on his interface 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.079
 a very easy to understand interface 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 and here it currently shows how much 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.660
 bc shows how much memory 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 memory is used at the moment and how much 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 free memory you can do here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 manual optimization for this here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.649
 click optimize now i tested before 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 and released 150 mega-memory 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.220
 good and testing again he released 34 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 mega anyway 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 So this is the system for you. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.939
 manually optimize 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 but if you want it to optimize the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.869
 your PC automatically without you 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.400
 need to be clicking all the time to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 optimize you see the team in 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.049
 settings and here you will have several 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.390
 options have here a minimized in the area of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.329
 to activate the option it stays on. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.640
 open in the background has to open 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.950
 ice mary with windows that's cool to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.049
 you leave it in automatic mode you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.090
 active when starting a pc 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 the program starts to start optimizing the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.100
 memory is cleaning the memory area. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.579
 transfer to optimize things that you 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.340
 I liked the control and it's clean. 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.799
 all this is here to check if a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.750
 new version can leave and this one that 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.600
 the interesting part that inhabited the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.509
 automatic optimization and activate the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 and when the memory has for example 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.840
 below 2,600 mega automatically 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.670
 program starts to use the memory of the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 your pc i can put five giga 8 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 12 as long as I want for example 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.569
 when there are only two days left 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 automatically ram program in action 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.300
 and does a cleansing in my memory 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.430
 This is ball show then you 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.810
 set it up any way you think 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.720
 best 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.459
 so this is what made this configuration can 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.959
 close the program here it stays here 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.720
 underneath the icons and keeps working 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.569
 background for you a problem is 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.880
 essential for anyone who uses windows knows 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.980
 that windows usually ends up getting 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.350
 slow when you use too much time then 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.840
 using a program like this it will 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.670
 help there on a daily basis so this is me 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.890
 I'll leave the download link on the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.380
 description I stand here 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.849
 A big hug and until the next video 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.720
 want to create a successful channel in 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.330
 youtube 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.730

 your channel and we will also review 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.120
 techniques to grow on youtube

 became interested then it is 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.140
