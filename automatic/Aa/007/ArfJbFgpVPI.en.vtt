00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.710 
you were to put it in you know you'd
have<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.140> force<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.640> male<00:04:46.910> side<00:04:47.480> is<00:04:47.690> a

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
have to force it in the male side is a

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.980 
have to force it in the male side is a
little<00:04:47.990> bit<00:04:48.110> larger<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.630> again<00:04:50.630> it's<00:04:50.810> just<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
little bit larger and again it's just a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.800 
little bit larger and again it's just a
case<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.200> slipping<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.860> foot<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.750> kind<00:04:53.750> of

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
case of slipping the foot in kind of

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.570 
case of slipping the foot in kind of
like<00:04:53.900> Cinderella<00:04:54.290> just<00:04:54.770> slip<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.220> foot<00:04:55.430> in

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
like Cinderella just slip the foot in

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.410 
like Cinderella just slip the foot in
and<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.450> just<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.720> right<00:04:56.840> size<00:04:58.240> it's<00:04:59.240> a

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
and it's just the right size it's a

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.880 
and it's just the right size it's a
little<00:04:59.630> bit<00:04:59.720> larger<00:05:00.140> because<00:05:00.290> some<00:05:00.650> male

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
little bit larger because some male

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.890 
little bit larger because some male
figures<00:05:01.340> seem<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.730> have<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.880> little<00:05:02.300> bit<00:05:02.420> larger

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
figures seem to have a little bit larger

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.680 
figures seem to have a little bit larger
feet<00:05:03.170> than<00:05:03.350> others<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.400> Adam<00:05:04.730> here's<00:05:04.970> think

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
feet than others the Adam here's think

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.210 
feet than others the Adam here's think
some<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.590> figures<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:06.860> have<00:05:06.980> these

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
some of the figures that have these

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.700 
some of the figures that have these
smaller<00:05:07.550> feet<00:05:07.820> Adam<00:05:08.030> is<00:05:08.270> one<00:05:08.450> of<00:05:08.570> them<00:05:08.690> but<00:05:09.650> you

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
smaller feet Adam is one of them but you

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.490 
smaller feet Adam is one of them but you
just<00:05:09.890> slide<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.460> into<00:05:10.550> place<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.410> there<00:05:12.410> you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
just slide it into place and there you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.050 
just slide it into place and there you
have<00:05:12.530> Adam<00:05:14.710> it's<00:05:15.710> not<00:05:15.890> completely<00:05:16.280> snug

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
have Adam it's not completely snug

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.820 
have Adam it's not completely snug
obviously<00:05:17.360> as<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:17.960> can<00:05:18.080> see<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.410> figure<00:05:18.680> will

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
obviously as you can see the figure will

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.800 
obviously as you can see the figure will
fall<00:05:19.160> a<00:05:19.190> bit<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:20.060> kind<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.300> have<00:05:20.420> to<00:05:20.540> have<00:05:20.570> the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
fall a bit you kind of have to have the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.920 
fall a bit you kind of have to have the
figure<00:05:21.110> leaning<00:05:21.530> back<00:05:22.420> some<00:05:23.420> of<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.570> larger

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
figure leaning back some of the larger

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.500 
figure leaning back some of the larger
foot<00:05:24.290> figures<00:05:24.920> i<00:05:25.280> think<00:05:25.910> like<00:05:26.120> martian

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
foot figures i think like martian

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.750 
foot figures i think like martian
manhunter<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:27.200> whatnot

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
manhunter and whatnot

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.300 
manhunter and whatnot
will<00:05:29.750> probably<00:05:29.990> fit<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.410> little<00:05:30.740> easier<00:05:31.250> on

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
will probably fit a little easier on

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.720 
will probably fit a little easier on
these<00:05:31.640> stands<00:05:32.000> than<00:05:32.300> others<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:34.310> at<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.700> end

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
these stands than others but at the end

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.340 
these stands than others but at the end
of<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:34.970> day<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.300> seems<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.720> still<00:05:35.990> hold<00:05:36.200> the

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
of the day it seems to still hold the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.550 
of the day it seems to still hold the
figure<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.010> putting<00:05:37.790> them<00:05:37.880> on<00:05:38.000> display<00:05:38.560> so

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
figure and putting them on display so

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.900 
figure and putting them on display so
you<00:05:39.650> just<00:05:39.800> have<00:05:39.950> to<00:05:39.980> lean<00:05:40.250> them<00:05:40.370> back<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.550> slight

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
you just have to lean them back a slight

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.290 
you just have to lean them back a slight
bit<00:05:41.150> but<00:05:41.480> you've<00:05:42.080> got<00:05:42.320> Adam<00:05:42.800> on<00:05:43.160> his<00:05:43.850> display

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
bit but you've got Adam on his display

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.130 
bit but you've got Adam on his display
stand<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:47.060> only<00:05:47.240> strike<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:47.780> would<00:05:47.930> really

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
stand the only strike I would really

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.800 
stand the only strike I would really
give<00:05:48.410> these<00:05:48.620> stands<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:51.080> fact<00:05:51.350> that

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
give these stands is the fact that

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020 
give these stands is the fact that
they're<00:05:53.810> nice<00:05:54.080> display<00:05:54.500> stands<00:05:55.100> but

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
they're nice display stands but

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.120 
they're nice display stands but
unfortunate<00:05:56.660> because<00:05:56.930> they've<00:05:57.200> accommodated

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
unfortunate because they've accommodated

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.390 
unfortunate because they've accommodated

the logo of the Justice League Unlimited
they're<00:06:01.400> slightly<00:06:01.850> larger<00:06:02.600> than<00:06:02.630> I<00:06:02.810> think

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
they're slightly larger than I think

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.480 
they're slightly larger than I think
what<00:06:03.200> they<00:06:03.320> could<00:06:03.560> be<00:06:03.740> or<00:06:03.980> what<00:06:04.160> they<00:06:04.280> should

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
what they could be or what they should

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.850 
what they could be or what they should
have<00:06:04.520> been<00:06:04.610> these<00:06:05.540> foot<00:06:06.020> stands<00:06:06.560> should<00:06:06.740> been

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
have been these foot stands should been

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.410 
have been these foot stands should been
a<00:06:06.950> little<00:06:07.160> closer<00:06:07.400> together<00:06:07.670> and<00:06:08.000> euchre<00:06:08.300> to

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
a little closer together and euchre to

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.080 
a little closer together and euchre to
probably<00:06:08.750> reduce<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.650> size<00:06:09.950> of<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.220> stand<00:06:10.550> to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
probably reduce the size of the stand to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.950 
probably reduce the size of the stand to
about<00:06:11.360> that

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
about that

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.770 
about that
I'm<00:06:12.470> obviously<00:06:12.860> for<00:06:13.130> how<00:06:13.340> large<00:06:14.060> these<00:06:14.390> stands

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
I'm obviously for how large these stands

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.350 
I'm obviously for how large these stands
it<00:06:15.050> are<00:06:15.230> versus<00:06:16.130> how<00:06:16.340> large<00:06:16.640> these<00:06:16.910> figures

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
it are versus how large these figures

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.460 
it are versus how large these figures
are<00:06:17.980> to<00:06:18.980> put<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.340> figure<00:06:19.730> in<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.540> stand<00:06:20.900> well

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
are to put the figure in the stand well

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.550 
are to put the figure in the stand well
but<00:06:22.160> figure<00:06:22.460> in<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.640> sand<00:06:22.970> you<00:06:23.930> got<00:06:24.140> a<00:06:24.290> lot<00:06:24.530> of

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
but figure in the sand you got a lot of

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.080 
but figure in the sand you got a lot of
this<00:06:24.740> excess<00:06:25.280> waste<00:06:26.200> so<00:06:27.200> imagine<00:06:27.830> having<00:06:28.090> you

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
this excess waste so imagine having you

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.940 
this excess waste so imagine having you
know<00:06:29.180> 25<00:06:30.220> well<00:06:31.220> 25<00:06:31.790> stands<00:06:32.120> 25<00:06:32.690> figures<00:06:33.170> you

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
know 25 well 25 stands 25 figures you

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.080 
know 25 well 25 stands 25 figures you
can't<00:06:34.160> really<00:06:34.280> have<00:06:34.460> them<00:06:34.640> next<00:06:34.790> to<00:06:34.970> one

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
can't really have them next to one

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.340 
can't really have them next to one
another<00:06:35.330> because<00:06:35.420> you<00:06:35.600> have<00:06:35.690> all<00:06:35.810> this<00:06:35.900> excess

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
another because you have all this excess

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.090 
another because you have all this excess
space<00:06:36.650> on<00:06:36.860> the<00:06:36.950> one<00:06:37.130> side<00:06:38.530> so<00:06:39.530> that's<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:39.890> one

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
space on the one side so that's that one

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.170 
space on the one side so that's that one
of<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:40.280> only<00:06:40.430> things<00:06:40.580> I<00:06:40.760> really<00:06:40.970> would<00:06:41.090> have

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
of the only things I really would have

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.090 
of the only things I really would have
changed<00:06:41.540> is<00:06:41.720> it<00:06:41.870> would<00:06:41.960> have<00:06:42.050> been<00:06:42.140> nice<00:06:42.350> they

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
changed is it would have been nice they

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.590 
changed is it would have been nice they

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600

ended<00:06:45.170> together<00:06:45.590> than<00:06:46.160> what<00:06:46.370> they<00:06:46.550> did<00:06:47.290> they

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
League logo in the middle but I think

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.710 
League logo in the middle but I think
that's<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:52.910> one<00:06:53.150> thing<00:06:53.390> I<00:06:53.480> would<00:06:53.540> have

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
that's the one thing I would have

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
that's the one thing I would have
changed<00:06:53.930> about<00:06:54.110> these<00:06:54.380> stands

that aside great stands and really

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.559 
that aside great stands and really
something<00:07:00.699> that<00:07:00.910> they<00:07:01.090> should<00:07:01.300> have<00:07:01.419> done

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 
something that they should have done

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.300 
something that they should have done
with<00:07:01.720> the<00:07:01.870> DC<00:07:02.229> Universe<00:07:02.590> too<00:07:02.800> because<00:07:03.130> I

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
with the DC Universe too because I

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.740 
with the DC Universe too because I
believe<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.729> DC<00:07:04.000> Universe<00:07:04.330> only<00:07:04.569> have<00:07:04.720> a

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
have holes in their feet so they should
