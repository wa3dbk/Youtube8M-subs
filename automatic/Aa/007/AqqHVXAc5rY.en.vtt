 for another step of an operation that 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.559
 It's been happening for over 30 days. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 all are prepared to reach the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.109
 where the airplane disappeared from the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.750
 March 18 was located by a 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 garimpeiro fausto pereira da silva 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 explored ore when for a happy 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 coincidence encountered the aircraft 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 I went walking in the sky making the area 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.250
 where correcting the area where the full 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.460
 affection 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.469
 already knew that the plane was down and who 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 thought the reward when 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.039
 they arrived on the street, there was not everybody 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.469
 has sought no one has met my god 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.899
 Only I knew where I was. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.579
 Fausto was invited to remain under the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 protection of civilian police in 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.770
 he still needed to be 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 heard in testimony to strengthen the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.809
 investigation which was initiated to ascertain 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.420
 the case since so far everything that is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.880
 know is that there are no survivors and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.180
 this situation after that the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.180
 bodies will be taken, certainly not. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 also with all respect with the people 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 when you were transported to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 itaituba for the emmy of itaituba and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.420
 we will also see the situation and give the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 personal objects also deliver 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 to relate to deliver to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.829
 family of materials 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 the objects found are 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.950
 waiting for a Japanese to go there 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 together with the fire department that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.049
 has arrived 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.100
 we believe that they are going to take 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 the bodies of the aircraft 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 all the bodies are trying are 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.869
 dead 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 so at that moment we are 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.750
 waiting only now for the afternoon 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.390
 scroll to the location 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 It's five hours and 40 minutes. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.229
 in front of the place known as 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.689
 sesai's house 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.430
 here is the point of concentration of the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.530
 volunteer teams 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.310
 only this first group has 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.940
 approximately 15 people going to the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.180
 where the aircraft was found 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.830
 the objective is to assist in the rescue of here 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 onwards we have a trip 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.560
 approximately 70 kilometers and 30 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.290
 transamazonic highway and the remainder 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.410
 by an extension and the interior of the jungle 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.460
 an exhausting journey that many 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 people have even made an aircraft 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.760
 greater anxiety is due to the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.450
 closure of all this situation that has 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.670
 lasts 37 days 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.740
 we hit the road at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.070
 we need to get to the place with the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.710
 first daylight after 30 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.810
 kilometers along the transamazon highway 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.720
 we arrive at the entrance of the branch that gives 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 access to the garimpo are sebastião from 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.910
 hence 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.220
 the journey becomes more dangerous the hillsides 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.680
 reach more than 20 meters in height and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.730
 range from three to five kilometers 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.370
 extension 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.810
 evaluating for these conditions it is possible 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.590
 have an idea of ​​the difficulties 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.180
 groups of volunteers 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.209
 they searched hundreds of kilometers 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.600
 squares on the search for the shore plane 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.090
 from the transamazon highway to this location 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.120
 were 17 kilometers down a road 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.280
 known as são sebastião branch 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.830
 is exactly at this point where 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.500
 we should enter for closer to a thousand 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.110
 meters to the place where the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.290
 during those more than 35 days of 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.390
 the teams received a strong 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.489
 support from people who have knowledge 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.090
 over the forest 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.880
 people who are known as 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.489
 and also several indigenous people. 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.500
 theirs is the river has b 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.470
 the course model is peace here will go 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.300
 talk to him, go to here we 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.050
 we arrive at a place that we perceive is 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.570
 a typical forest here in this region 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.040
 kills relatively close what we people 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.730
 will meet us from here until we arrive 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.459
 to the river 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.340
 good and is from that moment we 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.709
 we leave the vehicle and not like on foot 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.489
 more or less about 500 meters 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.490
 Let's get to the plane a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.590
 has a slope and quite large is not 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.570
 Fulfilled there we are not going there 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.840
 research does not reach the conditions of 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.910
 time 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.210
 where the plane is located is flooded a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.510
 The puddle is actually the is a reason 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.979
 no kind so a flood like this is well 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.320
 drenched but you can get to the plane 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.250
 one more step of the trip this time by 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.979
 middle of the woods an inhospitable environment 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.040
 closed the teams need to 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.410
 go down the slopes very carefully 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 now we are approaching the place 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.110
 where is the airplane a small course 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.930
 as a trail 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.389
 after approximately 40 minutes of 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.790
 walking we arrived a few meters from the 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.910
 place where the 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.130
 Rescue operation teams prepare 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.560
 the place for the arrival of the men of the 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.830
 the fire department that also comes 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.870
 trail 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.200
 soon after the fab helicopter 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.600
 arrives at the place and begins the visit of the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.760
 service technicians and 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.889
 prevention of aviation accidents or 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.229
 seripa that will make the first 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.340
 technical survey to identify the 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.340
 causes of the accident 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.840
 rescue equipment comes 9 in 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:52.990
 then the surrounding operation involves 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.220
 a lot of risks but everything ends 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.220
 as planned 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.130
 with the arrival of the fire brigade and 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.630
 operational equipment started its 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.220
 rescue work 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.010
 special mission command men 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.410
 the military police were in charge of 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.050
 to safeguard the area to avoid 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.110
 entrance of curious including the local 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.940
 where the aircraft was insulated by 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.640
 determination of the commander of the 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.160
 firemen with isolated area operation 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.130
 was started but had to be suspended 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.320
 at the end of Thursday afternoon until then 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.240
 had not yet been withdrawn 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.550
 airplane body 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.520
 already on friday the work resumed 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.430
 at 7 o'clock in the morning it rained a lot 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.210
 and this could make it difficult to 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.650
 some relatives of the victims 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.669
 ship with all the anxiety 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.850
 movement 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:51.780
 we have been accompanying the rescue as 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:54.030
 It will be the procedures and try 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.960
 rather than neglecting the staff who 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.690
 will train the curious not to take away 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.710
 portraits to 1 but it does not matter either 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.620
 respect with families, right? 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:11.270
 if you do not know the conditions then we 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.270
 also wait and make this case is this
