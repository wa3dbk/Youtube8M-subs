00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.590
 who ever suffers from stress 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.229
 who sometimes lacks energy 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.859
 who do you think is more successful 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 someone with a lot of energy or someone with few teams 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.470
 lots of Energie 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.899
 yes often successful entrepreneurs are very scary sick people always by 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.280
 the energy level the higher the energy level the more successful all of them 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 to be 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.330
 and the rest of the stadium from port 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.470
 physicist scientist has done a test in the sixteen 66 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 in a dark room with a nearby sunlight in the room 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.980
 dropping on a prism with a joke 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700
 by 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.990
 the white sunlight fell on the prism on one side 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.400
 slightly broken out after another side 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.140
 seven spectral colors emerged 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740
 euro orange yellow 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.200
 green Blue 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.350
 indigo and violet in fact two more colors than the colors of violet 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 and caught up but we can't take this action 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.670
 and therefore he has shown that all colors are enclosed in the sunlight 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 nothing has color unless it falls on it 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.860
 where to go out is obligatory van gogh first of energy particles 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.450
 so those energy particles you can imagine that has energy 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.070
 influence on us 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.730
 if you come in contact with the color red, the red room has been used for a long time 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.860
 wearing red clothes 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.600
 then you get warmer 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.610
 your circulatory mentor 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.390
 the heart rate is increasing 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 I get more energy 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.220
 that in certain situations it is very good to use that power 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.640
 of that color like men who then in a dark suit of men a red tie 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.820
 that indicates you can not go online I will come to some extent 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.189
 height 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.649
 but beware I finally have the final say 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.399
 Each color has a harmonic effect and this would work again cameron 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.200
 is the effect of gold for example 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.660
 decisiveness and energy 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.220
 and we work this together if you have too much of it then it can be dismissed 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 influences and positivity and the display of power 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:27.779
 that dominance
