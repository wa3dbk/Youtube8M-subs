project that was being last year to to
see<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.090> could<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:25.730> American<00:00:26.730> version<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

see if we could do a American version of
Sailor<00:00:27.390> Moon<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:36.140> one<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> idea<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Sailor Moon it's one of the idea that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.549 
Sailor Moon it's one of the idea that
was<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.190> his<00:00:38.579> leg<00:00:38.820> waited<00:00:39.090> for

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
was to actually his leg waited for

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.700 
was to actually his leg waited for
computer-generated<00:00:40.559> backgrounds<00:00:42.710> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
computer-generated backgrounds and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.529 
computer-generated backgrounds and
possibly<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:44.910> vehicles<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.510> well

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
possibly for some vehicles as well

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
possibly for some vehicles as well
there's<00:00:45.989> various<00:00:46.410> designs<00:00:50.030> have<00:00:51.030> time<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> do

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there's various designs have time to do

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
there's various designs have time to do
much<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.710> here

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
much to that in here

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.410 
much to that in here
but<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.850> today<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:56.390> some<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
but this was today some of the some of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.630 
but this was today some of the some of
the<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.870> ideas<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> show<00:00:58.949> there's<00:00:59.489> been

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the other ideas in the show there's been

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
the other ideas in the show there's been
involved<00:00:59.969> part<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> live-action<00:01:00.859> part<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
involved part of live-action part so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.910 
involved part of live-action part so
animation<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.379> some<00:01:04.379> computer<00:01:04.710> animation

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
animation and some computer animation

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.410 
animation and some computer animation
anyway<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> isn't<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.570> shelves<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.960> now

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
anyway it isn't it is shelves right now

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.090 
anyway it isn't it is shelves right now
because<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.689> cheaper<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> bring<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because it's cheaper to bring over the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.730 
because it's cheaper to bring over the
the<00:01:14.820> important<00:01:15.330> cinnamon<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.140> redubbed<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:43.830 

so

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.560 

is<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.050> doctor
