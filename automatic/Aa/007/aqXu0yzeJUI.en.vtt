00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.889 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.120> talk<00:00:03.210> about<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.840> to

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.490 
segment we're going to talk about how to
plant<00:00:04.319> sod<00:00:04.770> now<00:00:05.730> sod<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.450> just<00:00:06.690> rolled<00:00:07.080> up

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
plant sod now sod is just rolled up

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.759 
plant sod now sod is just rolled up
pieces<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.630> looks<00:00:09.630> like<00:00:09.690> carpet<00:00:10.349> but<00:00:10.620> they're

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
pieces of looks like carpet but they're

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.600 
pieces of looks like carpet but they're
actually<00:00:11.210> rolls<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.630> grass<00:00:13.139> ready<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
actually rolls of grass ready to go and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.630 
actually rolls of grass ready to go and
so<00:00:15.330> when<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.719> want<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.170> plant<00:00:16.470> your<00:00:16.619> sod<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
so when you want to plant your sod the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400 
so when you want to plant your sod the
first<00:00:17.910> thing<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.210> need<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
first thing you need to do is to make a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
first thing you need to do is to make a
diagram<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.400> area<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.420> figure<00:00:21.720> out

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
diagram of the area and to figure out

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
diagram of the area and to figure out
how<00:00:22.170> much<00:00:22.320> sod<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.650> need<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.850> need<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
how much sod you need so you need the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
how much sod you need so you need the
square<00:00:24.570> footage<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:26.039> you're<00:00:26.160> figuring

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
square footage so when you're figuring

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.009 
square footage so when you're figuring
out<00:00:26.640> your<00:00:26.760> square<00:00:27.060> footage<00:00:27.090> basically

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
out your square footage basically

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.780 
out your square footage basically
measure<00:00:28.320> each<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.519> lawn<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.660> then

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
measure each side of your lawn and then

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
measure each side of your lawn and then
multiplied<00:00:32.790> by<00:00:33.390> each<00:00:33.660> other<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
multiplied by each other so if you have

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
multiplied by each other so if you have
a<00:00:34.710> ten<00:00:35.010> foot<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:35.430> 10<00:00:35.640> feet<00:00:35.910> space<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
a ten foot by 10 feet space you have a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
a ten foot by 10 feet space you have a
hundred<00:00:37.649> square<00:00:38.129> feet<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> want<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
hundred square feet so you want to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
hundred square feet so you want to
figure<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.200> many<00:00:40.260> square<00:00:40.710> feet<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
figure out how many square feet you have

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.729 
figure out how many square feet you have
to<00:00:41.940> figure<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.660> many<00:00:42.719> square<00:00:43.140> yards<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
to figure out how many square yards of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
to figure out how many square yards of
sod<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.570> once<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> figured

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
sod you need and then once you figured

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860 
sod you need and then once you figured
that<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.760> order<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> sod<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that out then you can order the sod and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
that out then you can order the sod and
have<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> delivered<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> trick<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have it delivered now the trick was

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
have it delivered now the trick was
sawed<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.660> want<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.140> sure<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
sawed is that you want to make sure you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
sawed is that you want to make sure you
have<00:00:52.649> lots<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:53.280> organic<00:00:53.760> material<00:00:54.629> underneath

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
have lots of organic material underneath

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
have lots of organic material underneath
that<00:00:55.710> side<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:56.940> grow<00:00:57.239> right

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that side because it will not grow right

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.529 
that side because it will not grow right
on<00:00:57.660> clay<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.859> grow<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.000> top

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
on clay it will not grow right on top

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.959 
on clay it will not grow right on top
soil<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.109> no<00:01:01.350> nutrition<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> want

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
soil that has no nutrition so you want

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
soil that has no nutrition so you want
to<00:01:03.090> put<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.420> least<00:01:03.449> six<00:01:03.899> inches<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> foot<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to put at least six inches to a foot of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
to put at least six inches to a foot of
really<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.060> composted<00:01:06.930> material<00:01:07.170> or

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
really good composted material or

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
really good composted material or
potting<00:01:08.280> soil<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:09.150> any<00:01:09.479> good<00:01:09.780> organic

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
potting soil or any good organic

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
potting soil or any good organic
material<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> put<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> right

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
material you don't want to put it right

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
material you don't want to put it right
on<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.600> clay<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> big

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
on to clay because that's the big

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
on to clay because that's the big
mistake<00:01:14.280> most<00:01:14.430> people<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.060> new

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
mistake most people do in new

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
mistake most people do in new
developments<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.380> remove<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> topsoil

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
developments they remove the topsoil

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
developments they remove the topsoil
then<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:17.790> put<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> sod<00:01:18.330> right<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> top<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
then they put the sod right on top of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
then they put the sod right on top of
the<00:01:19.470> clay<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> there's<00:01:20.369> nothing<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the clay and there's nothing for it to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
the clay and there's nothing for it to
grow<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.960> once<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
grow on to once you have your side and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
grow on to once you have your side and
you<00:01:23.759> lay<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.960> sure<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> lay<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you lay it out make sure that you lay it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340 
you lay it out make sure that you lay it
out<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.729> linoleum<00:01:27.150> or<00:01:27.479> tile<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
out like you would linoleum or tile you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
out like you would linoleum or tile you
want<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> make<00:01:28.829> sure<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.939> roll

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
want to make sure that you have one roll

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
want to make sure that you have one roll
and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> start<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> other

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and then you want to start the other

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
and then you want to start the other
role<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> same<00:01:33.509> spot<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
role not at the same spot you want to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
role not at the same spot you want to
kind<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.860> stagger<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.640> zigzag<00:01:36.210> each<00:01:36.509> roll

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
kind of stagger it or zigzag each roll

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.100 
kind of stagger it or zigzag each roll
and<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.920> cut<00:01:38.130> pieces<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and so you can cut pieces to make the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
and so you can cut pieces to make the
difference<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> any<00:01:41.100> corners

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
difference and if you have any corners
