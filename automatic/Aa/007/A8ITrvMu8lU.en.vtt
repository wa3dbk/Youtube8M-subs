to get that area and kind of stretch it
out<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.560> I'd<00:03:51.830> run<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.100> lot<00:03:52.340> now<00:03:52.519> too<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:53.060> I've

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
out and I'd run a lot now too so I've

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.840 
out and I'd run a lot now too so I've
learned<00:03:53.300> a<00:03:53.510> lot<00:03:53.540> more<00:03:54.260> about<00:03:54.470> stretching<00:03:54.850> but

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
learned a lot more about stretching but

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.640 
learned a lot more about stretching but
for<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.540> sport<00:03:56.780> stretching<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.320> think<00:03:57.500> is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
for this sport stretching I think is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.880 
for this sport stretching I think is
extremely<00:03:58.430> important
