00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 jean reno we have more and more 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.030
 French and 1plusV versity 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.070
 interesting there too with presence of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.360
 schubert chest is the corridors of the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.560
 middle are important subban kof 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 it leaves not necessarily good part 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 these parties well for the Cuban at the lighthouse 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.279
 he dimitri bascou is rather in the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.160
 blow there is a big fight jdanov is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 in front of garfield darien garfield May 23rd 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 the chrono will be extremely interesting 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 for garfield which in my opinion a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 second to contact and fight with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 the russian champion of europe 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.170
 unfortunately for garfield I believe 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.149
 that he made a very, very big mistake 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 on the first hour we will review the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.910
 imagery 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 but that may be where you lose 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 race we will see that I think he has 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 makes a mistake maybe too close to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 it's because he's very strong in this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.590
 moment but what makes it behind for 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 get back into the race first and then 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 then disputed the shubin victory 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 chest it's very interesting to look 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 the departure of glass garfield but there 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 here I think that here it falls the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 first hour and after unfortunately 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.689
 there is yet another error to the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.880
 third and so it's far from being a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.260
 star cut does but there we see that at the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 fight he's coming back on 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 chopin cov and maybe that energy 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 that he left the feathers that left him 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 on these two big technical mistakes 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 well it costs him the win but in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 anyway he's very beefy I think 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 that he is able to beat his 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.450
 record at 13 15 and I also want to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 highlight the beautiful third place of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.939
 dimitri bascou driven by giscard 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 samba the french sun contingent will have 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.640
 been very good tonight finishing 2nd and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 3rd 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.030
 yeah actually we saw again 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 a fault at the ninth hurdle for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.560
 garfield and then schuhbeck off who 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.390
 has a run a little cleaner and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 although they prevail but garfield 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.040
 was watching done 13 23 1 it's still 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.899
 a time to finally wear that takes 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.710
 the third place we discover in 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.060
 live at the same time as you see 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 actually the images and then we have 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.610
 won who is already in contact with all 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.719
 interested people that's good but 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.879
 it's good that's also it 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.410
 live yeah yeah that's dtn it's flirting 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.300
 is already in contact with the athletes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.840
 who are there is exactly the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.250
 given 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 a news that tell them how they 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 felt safe but she has some 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 resource 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 she has a lot of people in 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.709
 reserve and the world championship this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.849
 may not be the championship of the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.660
 easy world but I believe that the mass 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.989
 is not said 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.989
 but
