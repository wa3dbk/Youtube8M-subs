00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
than that she's running pretty good I'll

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.460 
than that she's running pretty good I'll
let<00:00:37.920> her<00:00:38.130> warm<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:38.910> maybe<00:00:39.840> driving

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
let her warm up and then maybe driving

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.030 
let her warm up and then maybe driving
around<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:40.800> bit

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.110 

well<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.220> seems<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.610> running<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.090> right

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
well it seems to be running all right

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
well it seems to be running all right
and<00:00:45.360> I've<00:00:45.420> let<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.600> warm<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.350> bit

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and I've let it warm up for a little bit

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.890 
and I've let it warm up for a little bit
I<00:00:46.710> drove<00:00:47.340> idler<00:00:47.850> down<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:49.220> there<00:00:50.220> we<00:00:50.400> go<00:00:50.900> and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.790 
I suppose we'll see if it if it shifts
on<00:00:54.989> his<00:00:55.110> own<00:00:55.730> sometimes<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.560> winter<00:00:58.560> when
