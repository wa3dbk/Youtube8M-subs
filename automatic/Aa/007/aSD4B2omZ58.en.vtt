00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
doesn't matter maybe they'll convince or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.240 
doesn't matter maybe they'll convince or
no<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:03.229> lost<00:01:04.229> altogether

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.590 

yeah<00:01:08.250> maybe<00:01:08.670> went<00:01:08.880> off<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> deep<00:01:09.119> end<00:01:09.390> right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
yeah maybe went off the deep end right

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.050 
yeah maybe went off the deep end right
then<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:11.990> okay<00:01:13.020> open<00:01:13.590> primary

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
then in there okay open primary

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
then in there okay open primary
basically<00:01:15.060> nothing<00:01:15.600> nothing<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:19.220> shorter

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
basically nothing nothing a shorter

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.969 
basically nothing nothing a shorter
primary

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
primary

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.940 
primary
yeah<00:01:22.969> nothing<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.659> no<00:01:23.960> Sam<00:01:24.229> case<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.799> went

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
yeah nothing and no Sam case just went

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:35.130 
yeah nothing and no Sam case just went
cool<00:01:25.250> yeah<00:01:30.640> shorted<00:01:31.640> condenser<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.500> gauge

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
cool yeah shorted condenser and gauge

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.460 
cool yeah shorted condenser and gauge
weights<00:01:36.140> very<00:01:36.380> noisy<00:01:36.799> no<00:01:37.310> Spartanburg

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.800 

now<00:01:42.470> this<00:01:42.590> one's<00:01:42.770> not<00:01:42.920> open<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.390> primary

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
now this one's not open in the primary

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.569 
now this one's not open in the primary
but<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:44.990> high<00:01:45.140> resistance<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> primary

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
but a high resistance in the primary

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.499 
but a high resistance in the primary
reason<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:49.640> showed<00:01:49.789> this<00:01:49.939> one<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.360> like

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
reason I showed this one it's just like

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.300 
reason I showed this one it's just like
it<00:01:50.990> X<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.439> coil<00:01:51.649> tester<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.219> an

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
it X and the coil tester just like an

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.270 
it X and the coil tester just like an
open<00:01:52.429> but<00:01:53.390> if<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.569> use<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.929> comm<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.099> and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
open but if you use the comm on it and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.630 
open but if you use the comm on it and
measure<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:57.140> come<00:01:57.319> up<00:01:57.470> with<00:01:57.500> us<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:58.399> you

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
measure it you come up with us but you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.300 
measure it you come up with us but you
realize<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.420> on<00:02:00.349> all<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:00.770> open<00:02:01.099> so

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
realize it it's not on all right open so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.600 
realize it it's not on all right open so
it<00:02:01.459> could<00:02:01.700> for<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.299> using<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.720> DB<00:02:03.079> om<00:02:03.349> on<00:02:04.250> here

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
it could for you using a DB om on here

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.300 
it could for you using a DB om on here
as<00:02:04.700> opposed<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.060> using<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.539> tester<00:02:08.530> okay<00:02:09.530> an

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
as opposed to using the tester okay an

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.670 
as opposed to using the tester okay an
open<00:02:10.819> condenser<00:02:14.860> no<00:02:15.860> spark<00:02:16.340> once<00:02:17.180> again

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
open condenser no spark once again

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
open condenser no spark once again
excessive<00:02:18.680> or<00:02:18.950> hanging<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.340> points<00:02:19.790> we're

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
excessive or hanging at the points we're

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.270 
excessive or hanging at the points we're
losing<00:02:20.810> all<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.049> energy<00:02:21.440> across<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.920> points

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
losing all the energy across the points

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.759 
losing all the energy across the points
because<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> cadets<00:02:23.329> are<00:02:23.450> basically<00:02:24.079> not

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
because the cadets are basically not

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:33.660 
because the cadets are basically not
doing<00:02:25.040> anything<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:30.340> lot<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.459> examples<00:02:32.109> yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
doing anything a lot of examples yeah

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.770 
doing anything a lot of examples yeah
what's<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.730> good<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.000> back<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.389> there<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.600> to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
what's a good one back in there just to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:45.780 
what's a good one back in there just to
see<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.019> again<00:02:36.079> compared

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.070 

Wow

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.220 

noticeable<00:02:50.080> difference<00:02:50.680> yeah
