00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello friends in this video I'm going to talk 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.840
 of a very important natural product to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.150
 the time to gain weight but also 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.760
 I want to clarify some details about a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.189
 article that I wrote some time ago 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 and that every day directive dozens of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 emails and I want to clarify those details 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.890
 then in this video we are going to talk 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.769
 of the wonderful product they already created 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 the nature that is called yeast 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.100
 beer 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.590
 Brewer's yeast can help you 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.440
 gain weight if it is true 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.290
 now the brewer's yeast because I say 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.590
 can help you on the weight and I do not say 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 let me go now I explain the picture of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.670
 beer is a wonderful rich product 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.670
 in vitamins of group b 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.380
 has essential amino acids that are the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.190
 protein ingredients 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.409
 and it has some minerals that also 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.060
 they are important 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.610
 now 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.950
 I want us to pay attention to something very 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 important that almost nobody notices 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.450
 is the next 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.090
 too thin people 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.760
 normally for 90% of cases are 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.670
 people like super excited very 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.870
 nervous people who do not have 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 patience 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.560
 and this same attitude consumes a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.950
 excessive amount of vitamins 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 B Group 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.330
 and the veterans of group b is also 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.480
 brewer's yeast then 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.020
 and on the other hand if there is a person who 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.200
 have deficiencies of vitamin b 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 will create a state of anxiety that 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 It will take you 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.939
 to low weight or excess weight 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 so hello is going to make him eat more than 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.519
 normal and fattening or what will you do 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.890
 I eat less or eat what I eat 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.290
 that does not assimilate 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.360
 then it is not by mouth but what 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.270
 the body assimilates also at a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.670
 intestinal then we enter the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.540
 affair 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.959
 the yeast beer could help you 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.349
 If you are short of Welsh Welsh , 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.829
 it owes to a lack of vitamins 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.409
 group by is also going to help you because 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.180
 your nervous system is going to balance and 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.519
 you will assimilate then better the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.319
 nutrients but apart from introducing the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.680
 Brewer's yeast in your diet 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.409
 you have to start feeding better to 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.930
 rest better consume products of 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.109
 better quality to do the exercise 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.569
 specific that I'll talk about in other 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.180
 videos what it is and what are the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.810
 exercises that we can and those that do not 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.810
 we must 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.690
 now let's focus again on the 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.520
 famous brewer's yeast as the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.310
 can you can get in capsules 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.340
 in pills 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.830
 how cubes come in envelopes then 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.630
 the shape gives exactly the same to me 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.690
 I particularly like the way more 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.580
 natural that those envelopes because then 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.590
 to put it in a capsule, they put it in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.380
 a capsule to make the pill 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.610
 press and and sometimes you put excipients and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.000
 to avoid addictive Products 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.000
 top 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.480
 in bags then you can get in 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.940
 any herbalist centers 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.250
 diet and what you have to take are 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.840
 two spoons 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.840
 for dessert 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.120
 in the morning at noon at night what 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.940
 perfect would be to take half an hour 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.750
 hour before breakfast of food and 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.180
 the dinner if not then 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.549
 give you this space simply with 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.030
 take it love to you you before is enough 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.160
 with 510 minutes also before each 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.780
 You can solve the food in a juice by 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 example 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.700
 of mango ex first would be a good 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.160
 option 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.940
 in water or in plant beds 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.639
 so my friend and friend 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.249
 my friends 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.349
 I want from now enter 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.240
 is the brewer's yeast in our 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.919
 Feeding a part of wax yeast 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.009
 It is a proactive product and helps 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.870
 purify the liver the kidneys and help 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.860
 for the function of the lungs and the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.860
 nervous system 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.260
 another important thing 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.480
 there is only one case 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.370
 a group of cases in which 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.370
 I recommend brewer's yeast 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:12.879
 when there is an infection 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.969
 candidiasis or fungal infections 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.189
 because there are people 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.950
 and they are extremely thin or 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.810
 thin 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.380
 it's because they have a chronic infection 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.810
 of a yeast called candida 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.210
 in other places I will talk about it 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.810
 all other cases yeast of 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.920
 beer is a miracle of nature 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.660
 use the 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.660
 and they tell me about their successes 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.510
 I could help you thank you for your 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.510
 Chao time
