00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.550
 can sniff so freely in the camera 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
 they did not pig sooner 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 they stood in individual boxes 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
 only last year has farmer 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
 friedrich ahlers the group attitude 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 introduced since the first of january this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.800
 year duty to rebuild the job 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.990
 cost him 200 euro per animal for that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 move more now and are 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.449
 less often the first experiences 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 which we within the last year 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.260
 you must have collected now too 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.350
 say are very positive and we are with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 to offer the changeover better than we do 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.320
 The next ones are only planned in advance 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 steps but fear conventional 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.899
 Pig owners like ahlers from 2018 may 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 He does not care for his newborn piglet 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.969
 castrate and not copy 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.590
 that is, the rings tails support 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 his view but an important protection 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 against bite injuries among the animals 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 under infections 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.100
 that what eyes now I'm in the conversation 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.760
 is not under this enormous time pressure 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 makeable 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 we ourselves as farmers know 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.110
 we have to change some things again and we have to change that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.549
 it just wants to be the tempo now 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.409
 is struck is not acceptable 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.420
 farmers like ahlers are reacting 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 pressure and laws but they demand more 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 time for the implementation of new ones 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 regulations also for those of the eu 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 long-term demand for electricity 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.790
 martin schulz has it already before 20 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 years ago and can do that too 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.560
 not at his meanwhile 800 pig 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 imagine something different 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 This is the first time I work 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.409
 times the pig and has the advantages 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.700
 Although that was wine I was lying that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.500
 was a bit on some concrete 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.980
 lie but want 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.260
 they want to deviate electricity protection 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.660
 sells his pigs over new land 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.270
 a marketing organization the the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.310
 new animal welfare plans also fulfill that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.970
 he has long been the tail of the rings 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.370
 forbidden 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.740
 only once a year does he have to have an animal 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.240
 from the group take an infection 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.990
 by injured rings to tails 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.270
 avoid 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.400
 we do not need any more graceful 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.240
 with us because the animals are reasonable 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 being held 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 and that is an indication and the second 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.060
 It is simply social 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.940
 more acceptable that the animals 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 any limbs cuts off 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.550
 to comply with the conditions of the holding 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.420
 the conditions are adapted 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.080
 So that the holding conditions 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.420
 can endure at all 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.670
 only a few larger plants like that of 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.260
 martin schulz plans on animal welfare, the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.120
 new guidelines from brussels though 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.860
 should put pressure on me too 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.860
 convert large farms soon
