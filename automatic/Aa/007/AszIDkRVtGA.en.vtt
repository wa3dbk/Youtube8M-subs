in different ways and then at the same
time<00:04:11.470> we've<00:04:11.770> taken<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.040> lot<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.250> really

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
time we've taken a lot of really

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.580 
time we've taken a lot of really
conventional<00:04:13.060> instruments<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.720> tried<00:04:14.410> to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
conventional instruments and tried to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.970 
conventional instruments and tried to
play<00:04:15.070> them<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.580> use<00:04:15.970> them<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.560> frankly<00:04:17.560> abuse

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
play them and use them and frankly abuse

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.819 
play them and use them and frankly abuse
them<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.880> really<00:04:19.480> unconventional<00:04:19.750> ways<00:04:20.350> not

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
them in really unconventional ways not

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.300 
them in really unconventional ways not
to<00:04:20.890> mention<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.670> our<00:04:21.820> artist<00:04:22.300> amon<00:04:22.720> tobin

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
to mention that our artist amon tobin

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.980 
to mention that our artist amon tobin
manipulates<00:04:24.310> sounds<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.030> carries<00:04:25.570> them<00:04:25.750> into

manipulates sounds and carries them into

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.590 
manipulates sounds and carries them into
a<00:04:26.020> completely<00:04:26.770> different<00:04:27.370> space<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.420> that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
a completely different space so that

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.380 
a completely different space so that
even<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.080> combat<00:04:29.560> music<00:04:30.010> has<00:04:30.280> this<00:04:30.460> effect<00:04:30.940> of

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
even the combat music has this effect of

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.280 
even the combat music has this effect of
sounding<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.140> city<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.650> kind<00:04:33.010> of

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
sounding like the city is kind of

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.280 
sounding like the city is kind of
throwing<00:04:35.290> its<00:04:35.530> head<00:04:35.680> back<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.160> luring<00:04:37.290> the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
throwing its head back and luring the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.180 
throwing its head back and luring the
thing<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:38.620> really<00:04:38.710> different<00:04:38.830> about

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
thing that's really different about

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.130 
thing that's really different about
implements<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.150> level<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.510> density<00:04:40.750> we

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
implements is the level of density we

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.110 
implements is the level of density we
have<00:04:41.350> in<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.620> city<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:42.370> makes<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.730> much<00:04:42.880> more
