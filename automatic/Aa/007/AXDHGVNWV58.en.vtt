00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
fairly cheap if you convert it into

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.590 
fairly cheap if you convert it into
dollars<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.709> like<00:02:44.859> 400<00:02:45.269> something<00:02:46.269> like

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
dollars it's like 400 something like

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.150 
dollars it's like 400 something like
that<00:02:46.750> without<00:02:46.959> contract<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:47.920> fairly

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
that without contract so it is fairly

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.110 
that without contract so it is fairly
cheap<00:02:48.549> for<00:02:49.030> an<00:02:49.120> HTC<00:02:49.299> one<00:02:49.959> device<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
cheap for an HTC one device but and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.520 
cheap for an HTC one device but and
that's<00:02:52.359> why<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.570> has<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> small<00:02:53.049> screen<00:02:53.320> with

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
that's why it has a small screen with

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.729 
that's why it has a small screen with
3.7<00:02:54.220> 1v<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.940> other<00:02:55.329> hand<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.230> complete

the resolution on the one B is actually

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.250 
the resolution on the one B is actually
not<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:04.879> good<00:03:05.329> it's<00:03:05.599> 480<00:03:06.200> x<00:03:06.379> 800<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.959> 1x<00:03:08.959> on

not that good it's 480 x 800 the 1x on

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.479 
not that good it's 480 x 800 the 1x on
the<00:03:09.319> other<00:03:09.469> hand<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.769> an<00:03:09.859> amazing<00:03:10.280> display

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
the other hand is an amazing display

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.289 
the other hand is an amazing display
with<00:03:10.939> super<00:03:11.480> LCD<00:03:12.170> display<00:03:12.500> 720<00:03:13.159> x<00:03:13.280> 1280<00:03:13.790> so

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
with super LCD display 720 x 1280 so

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.690 
with super LCD display 720 x 1280 so
you're<00:03:14.450> getting<00:03:14.599> HD<00:03:15.319> quality<00:03:15.620> screen<00:03:16.280> right

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you're getting HD quality screen right

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.390 
you're getting HD quality screen right
there<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:18.049> then<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.469> 1s<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.099> other<00:03:19.280> hand

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
there and then the 1s on the other hand

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.020 
there and then the 1s on the other hand
is<00:03:19.549> an<00:03:19.670> AMOLED<00:03:20.359> display<00:03:20.719> with<00:03:21.230> 540<00:03:22.010> x<00:03:22.340> 960

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
is an AMOLED display with 540 x 960

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.479 
is an AMOLED display with 540 x 960
pixels<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:23.629> you<00:03:23.750> have<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.959> keep<00:03:24.079> in<00:03:24.260> mind<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
pixels but you have to keep in mind the

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.610 
pixels but you have to keep in mind the
difference<00:03:25.909> between<00:03:26.030> side<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.719> the<00:03:27.200> pixel

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
difference between side so the pixel

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.679 
difference between side so the pixel
density<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.099> stuff<00:03:28.340> but<00:03:28.549> most<00:03:28.849> likely<00:03:29.000> this

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
density and stuff but most likely this

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.500 
density and stuff but most likely this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
will still have a higher pixel density

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
actually pretty strong next memory they

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.060 
actually pretty strong next memory they
have

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070

is<00:06:05.840> also<00:06:06.140> the<00:06:06.230> same<00:06:06.440> so<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.370> I<00:06:08.060> guess<00:06:08.390> you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
is also the same so that I guess you

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.820 
is also the same so that I guess you
would<00:06:08.720> have<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.900> choose<00:06:09.170> between<00:06:09.290> these<00:06:09.680> two

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
would have to choose between these two

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.150 
would have to choose between these two
but<00:06:09.980> I<00:06:10.130> they<00:06:10.550> also<00:06:10.700> have<00:06:11.000> a<00:06:11.030> believe<00:06:11.870> f<00:06:12.160> 2.2

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
but I they also have a believe f 2.2

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.270 
but I they also have a believe f 2.2
lens<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:13.850> that's<00:06:14.510> also<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.870> good<00:06:14.900> software<00:06:15.590> we
