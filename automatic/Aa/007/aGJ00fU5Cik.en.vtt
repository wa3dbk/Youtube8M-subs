00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 let's see the following operations 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.670
 addition and subtraction of the integers belittles 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.740
 plus 11 as they are of opposite signs 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.940
 we must subtract the greater minus the less 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 that is to say 13 we subtract 11 that gives us 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.410
 2 and that gives the result with the sign of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 greater is to say negative sign is as if 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 we had a sale of 13 but we have 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 11 then we paid the 11 but we were 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.430
 having 2 here we must first destroy 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.649
 the parenthesis applying the law of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 signs in this case because we have 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.750
 neighboring signs 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 that would be less 27 plus with less 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 it gives us less 7 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.050
 in this case how the two are negative 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 their values are added their values 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.979
 absolute that is 27 add up with 7 that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 we have 34 left and how the two are 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.719
 negative then the result also 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.560
 will be negative is like having a debt of 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.960
 27 and acquire another limitation 7 then 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 we have a total of 34 here minus 21 more 43 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:21.479
 as they are of signs contrary to 43 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 we must remove 21 that gives us 21 2 and 22 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.909
 remains with the sign of the greatest is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.000
 positive sign the answer would be more 22 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.840
 that we can write it simply as 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.399
 22 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.750
 it's as if we had 21 but we have 43 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.899
 then in this case we can pay what 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.159
 that we must and we remain with 22 to our 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.520
 favor 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.950
 let's see every 35 plus minus 40 again 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.319
 we have the neighboring signs we must 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.869
 apply the law of two signs here to 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:58.229
 destroy the parenthesis then we 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.479
 is 35 or so gives us minus 40 are 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.899
 of opposite signs one positive and another 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.439
 negative then at 40 we remove 35 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.799
 that gives us 5 and we put the sign of the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:15.329
 greater is to say negative sign here is 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:18.060
 as if we had 35 but we should 40 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:22.049
 then we pay the 35 that we have but 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.269
 5 were must Acasiete least 21 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.349
 they are of opposite signs a positive one and 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:32.970
 another negative we must subtract the to 21 it 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.109
 we remove 7 is gives us 14 and 14 takes the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.670
 sign of the greater is to say negative sign 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.180
 again it's like we have 7 and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 we should 21 then we pay 27 and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.510
 we are due 14 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.510
 here - 22 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.390
 - with less neighboring signs that gives us 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.940
 more 22 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.090
 these are called opposite numbers one 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.950
 negative and another positive when we have 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.100
 the interaction of the opposite numbers 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.700
 as in this case it is to drop zero because 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.160
 it's as if we had 22 and we had 22 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 then we pay what we owe and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.790
 we are at zero here again the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.440
 neighboring signs are already 14 less with 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.630
 less are left plus 18 is a sum of 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.330
 the positive integers is to say 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.890
 the natural numbers are added together and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.950
 current and that gives us 32 and for 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.640
 finish minus 29 minus 31 as both 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.330
 they are negative adds 29 with 31 that we 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.959
 gives 60 and the result will be negative is 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.480
 as if we had 29 and we had another 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.260
 debt of 31 then in total we must 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.260
