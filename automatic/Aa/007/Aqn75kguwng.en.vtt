00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.830
 yes human sacrifices are really 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 created for each other the social 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 structures in which dogs live and in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.290
 The people live incredibly 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.099
 similarly, the word is incredibly fun 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099
 to cooperate with 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.199
 Dogs belong to the family for me 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 means a life without a family and with it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.330
 but also without dogs 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.330
 I can not imagine anymore 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.770
 our offer is different from 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.300
 our competitors in that we are on 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.110
 an official certification 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.570
 to prepare 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.700
 this certification from the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.190
 veterinary chamber is valid nationwide 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.570
 Besides, we have a recognition one 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.960
 long school authority that our 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.830
 Education is important 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.239
 Humanity grows big with us 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.680
 That is, we form ours 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.699
 Participants not only easy but 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.250
 we accompany you on your next 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.690
 life way and work path that is if 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 you have opened a dog school 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.990
 You may have problems asking questions 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.970
 at any time after the training 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.930
 still love to contact us and we 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.930
 stand with advice and did available 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.750
 a big difference is that we 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.250
 do not adapt the model to the dog 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.020
 but we look at the individuality of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.910
 watch dog that means we have 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.620
 no finished model but judge us 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.690
 after the dog owner and after the dog 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.440
 And that fits on this team that is 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.300
 if you pillar it in three 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.560
 the dog should be summarized 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.570
 have fun training 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.030
 The dog owner should have fun and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.110
 in the end it should be a successful one 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.860
 our training will be that today 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 function 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.170
 yes our main model is one 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.080
 extra-occupational training you have 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.250
 others, but these two 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.590
 day seminars mainly on 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.010
 weekend is the usual 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.440
 path 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.420
 there will be theoretical and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.700
 practical units taught in the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.130
 Theory is learned from the ground up 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.440
 what we what we learn theories are there 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.790
 dog knows what he should do 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.530
 because of being able to steer 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.920
 and in practice that will be a piece for 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.920
 piece implemented 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 that here all this training is that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.480
 we prepare the people for it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 to work independently as a trainer 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.550
 that is capable of a dog school 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.830
 to lead 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.730
 and that's why the hour here on it 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.730
 prepared 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.930
 We also offer the dog trainer at 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 home study that there is a distance learning 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.590
 so that the participants are no longer with us 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.240
 but actually have to come 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.950
 very comfortable to learn from home 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.780
 Once a month they will be with us 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.069
 scripts are supplied and every two months 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.440
 But then we meet 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.690
 actually again to two practice days 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.980
 where we come in handy with the dogs and the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.980
 participants can work 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.590
 no participant needs to worry about us 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.480
 that he did not have the training goal 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.650
 we will be there 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.050
 will accompany him step by step 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 We currently have that 's the reason 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.620
 Why we do not have a concentrated education 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.740
 but have all the training 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.020
 over several months and how 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.100
 Finally good for them 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.100
 dog trainers can train
