00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.250 

get<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:02.010> big<00:01:05.090> it<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.420> tend<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> reseed<00:01:07.229> itself

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

very<00:01:07.860> easily<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.950> keep<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> patio

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
very easily so I keep it in the patio

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670

rather<00:01:11.909> than<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> ground<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> can

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
rather than in the ground but it can

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.410
