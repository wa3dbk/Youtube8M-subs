00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
surface twin-lens design so you get

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.220

loads<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.300> strength<00:00:39.600> through<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.870> frame<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
loads of strength through the frame and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
loads of strength through the frame and
get<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.590> piece<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> nose<00:00:42.120> really

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
get this piece up for the nose really

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
get this piece up for the nose really
adds<00:00:42.809> extra<00:00:43.170> strength<00:00:44.180> reverse<00:00:45.180> teardrop

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
adds extra strength reverse teardrop

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.500 
adds extra strength reverse teardrop
design<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.680> excellent<00:00:47.550> visibility<00:00:47.820> when

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
design to get excellent visibility when

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
design to get excellent visibility when
looking<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:50.219> marries<00:00:50.700> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
looking down and that also marries up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.569 
looking down and that also marries up
with<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> raped<00:00:51.680> skirt<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.280> brings

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
with a raped skirt so it really brings

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
with a raped skirt so it really brings
in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.940> bottom<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> mask<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.260> towards<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in the bottom of the mask in towards the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
in the bottom of the mask in towards the
face<00:00:55.920> both<00:00:56.850> lowering<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> internal<00:00:58.199> volume

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
face both lowering the internal volume

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
face both lowering the internal volume
so<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> lower<00:00:59.070> profile<00:00:59.609> mask<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so they get a lower profile mask and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
so they get a lower profile mask and
also<00:01:00.690> improving<00:01:01.020> visibility<00:01:01.260> by<00:01:01.890> moving<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
also improving visibility by moving that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
also improving visibility by moving that
frame<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.480> visibility<00:01:03.719> range<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
frame out of your visibility range and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.410 
frame out of your visibility range and
you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> equipment<00:01:06.299> down

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

and now it gives the glass a green tinge
to<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.799> basically<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> light<00:02:08.429> comes

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to it basically when the light comes

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
to it basically when the light comes
through<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> starts<00:02:09.720> getting<00:02:09.959> reflected

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
through is it starts getting reflected

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.589 
through is it starts getting reflected
from<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.739> both<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> surface<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> also<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
from just both the surface and also the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
from just both the surface and also the
impurities

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
impurities

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.930 
impurities
sighs<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:13.950> get<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:14.370> light<00:02:14.670> for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
sighs you don't get as much light for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.260 
sighs you don't get as much light for
the<00:02:15.030> glass<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.920> crystal<00:02:17.280> clear<00:02:17.490> glass<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the glass the crystal clear glass has a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.900 
the glass the crystal clear glass has a
lot<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.570> those<00:02:18.750> impurities<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.470> iron

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
lot of those impurities and iron

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610 
lot of those impurities and iron
taken<00:02:20.910> out<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.600> loads<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
taken out of it so you get loads and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.230 
taken out of it so you get loads and
loads<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:23.100> light<00:02:23.310> through<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.940> feels

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
loads of light through so it feels

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.800 
loads of light through so it feels
really<00:02:24.480> Airy<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> also<00:02:26.400> makes<00:02:26.880> colors<00:02:27.780> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
really Airy so it also makes colors a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 
really Airy so it also makes colors a
lot<00:02:28.080> crisper<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.740> lot<00:02:28.950> more<00:02:29.130> true<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.760> their

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
lot crisper a lot more true to their

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.410 
lot crisper a lot more true to their
actual<00:02:30.180> color<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> great<00:02:32.220> glass<00:02:32.520> loads<00:02:33.300> of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
actual color so great glass loads of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
actual color so great glass loads of
light<00:02:33.600> coming<00:02:33.990> in<00:02:34.110> makes<00:02:34.590> everything<00:02:34.830> that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
light coming in makes everything that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
light coming in makes everything that
really<00:02:35.430> great<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:37.730> buckle<00:02:38.730> system<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
really great as well buckle system is a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.710 
really great as well buckle system is a
full<00:02:40.170> way<00:02:40.730> movement<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.330> known<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
full way movement it's known have you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.790 
full way movement it's known have you
got<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.960> up<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.380> which<00:02:43.560> you'd<00:02:43.680> normally

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
got the up and down which you'd normally

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.160 
got the up and down which you'd normally
expect<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> mask<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> vertical

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
expect on a mask so you get the vertical

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.620 
expect on a mask so you get the vertical
positioning<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.160> also<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
positioning you also get in and out so

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.230 
positioning you also get in and out so
you<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.900> loads<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.350> movement<00:02:50.280> from<00:02:51.000> got

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
you get loads of movement from got

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.960 
you get loads of movement from got
slightly<00:02:51.480> narrower<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.080> wider<00:02:52.410> head<00:02:52.850> gives<00:02:53.850> you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
slightly narrower a wider head gives you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
slightly narrower a wider head gives you
that<00:02:54.120> flexibility<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> comfort<00:02:55.080> just

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that flexibility and comfort just

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.680 
that flexibility and comfort just
prevents<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.100> from<00:02:56.280> being<00:02:57.060> comfortable<00:02:57.600> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
prevents it from being comfortable to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.190 
prevents it from being comfortable to
wear<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.500> back<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.580> strap<00:03:03.330> nice

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
wear and then on the back the strap nice

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.560 
wear and then on the back the strap nice
3d<00:03:04.800> molding<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.640> was<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> nice<00:03:06.030> sort<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
3d molding so it was a nice sort of

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.720 
3d molding so it was a nice sort of
finish<00:03:07.010> really<00:03:08.010> helps<00:03:08.250> spread<00:03:08.310> out<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
finish really helps spread out the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.510 
finish really helps spread out the
weight<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> unloading<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:11.010> fit
