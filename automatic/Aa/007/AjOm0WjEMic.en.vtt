fast anyways this is the second cutting
board<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.120> done<00:00:15.240> pyrography<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:16.109> well

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
board I have done pyrography on well

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.720 
board I have done pyrography on well
technically<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.100> more<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> chopping

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
technically it's more of a chopping

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.130 
technically it's more of a chopping
blocks<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> smaller<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> thicker<00:00:18.900> than<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
blocks is it smaller and thicker than a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810 
blocks is it smaller and thicker than a
normal<00:00:19.380> cutting<00:00:19.680> board<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
normal cutting board but you get the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.090 
normal cutting board but you get the
idea<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.900> your<00:00:22.020> head<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:23.070> friend

was<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> little<00:00:34.739> weird<00:00:34.920> doing<00:00:35.219> pyrography<00:00:35.670> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
was a little weird doing pyrography on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.430 
was a little weird doing pyrography on
it<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.210> because<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.630> kept<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it just because I kept on going back and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
it just because I kept on going back and
forth<00:00:37.649> between<00:00:37.800> pieces<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.370> maple<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> cherry

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
forth between pieces of maple and cherry

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
forth between pieces of maple and cherry
each<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> those<00:00:39.960> types<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> wood<00:00:40.469> reacts<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
each one of those types of wood reacts a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
each one of those types of wood reacts a
little<00:00:41.100> differently<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> burner<00:00:41.879> Charlie

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
little differently to the burner Charlie

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
little differently to the burner Charlie
burns<00:00:42.629> faster<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> darker<00:00:43.530> than<00:00:43.680> maple<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
burns faster and darker than maple I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
burns faster and darker than maple I
just<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> keep<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.120> mind<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.570> was

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
just had to keep that in mind as I was

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
just had to keep that in mind as I was
drawing<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.350> well<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:46.829> big

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
drawing it because well not to make big

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.560 
drawing it because well not to make big
deep<00:00:47.219> gouges<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> cherry<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.420> was

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
deep gouges in the cherry when I was

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
deep gouges in the cherry when I was
coming<00:00:48.840> off<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> maple<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.340> I'm

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520

coming off the maple for this one I'm
like<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.000> cutting<00:00:51.270> board<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
like the first cutting board I did I

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.200 
like the first cutting board I did I
didn't<00:00:52.890> sketch<00:00:53.129> anything<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.550> first<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.059> just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
didn't sketch anything out first I just

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
didn't sketch anything out first I just
went<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.840> did<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.770> couple

went at it I did look up a couple
pictures<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.370> Zeena's<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.940> use<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
pictures of Zeena's to use as a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
pictures of Zeena's to use as a
reference<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.020> customer<00:00:58.350> said

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
reference because the customer said

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.170 
reference because the customer said
those<00:00:58.770> were<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> her<00:00:59.280> favorite<00:00:59.520> flowers<00:00:59.969> I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
those were one of her favorite flowers I
liked<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.289> turned<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.940> one<00:01:02.940> thing<00:01:03.059> that's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
liked how it turned out one thing that's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.219

higher if I mess up and I'm dueling on a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.359 
higher if I mess up and I'm dueling on a
piece<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> paper<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.860> know<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.280> like

piece of paper you know and I don't like

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
piece of paper you know and I don't like
how<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.640> turning<00:01:11.820> out<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.270> ball<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> up
