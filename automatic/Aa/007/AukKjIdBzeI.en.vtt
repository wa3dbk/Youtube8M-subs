00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
gonna form an underhand loop like that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120 
gonna form an underhand loop like that
and<00:00:29.010> I'll<00:00:29.130> pull<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.550> working<00:00:29.699> end<00:00:30.060> through<00:00:31.130> and

and I'll pull my working end through and
then<00:00:32.250> come<00:00:32.489> over<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> standing<00:00:33.270> part<00:00:33.450> again

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bring that over the top again so it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.439 
bring that over the top again so it
looks<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
and I want to form my bottom loop now as

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.910 
and I want to form my bottom loop now as
big<00:01:00.909> as<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.149> want<00:01:01.359> my<00:01:01.510> teardrop<00:01:02.019> so<00:01:02.500> just<00:01:02.739> adjust

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
big as I want my teardrop so just adjust

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.359 
big as I want my teardrop so just adjust
it<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.519> size<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:04.030> like<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.860> now<00:01:09.040> bring

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.950 
it to the size you like and now bring
the<00:01:09.490> work<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> end<00:01:10.000> around<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.479> back<00:01:10.689> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
the work in the end around the back and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.180 
the work in the end around the back and
try<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.830> keep<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.159> tight<00:01:12.460> if<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.630> can<00:01:14.190> and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
try and keep this tight if you can and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.160 
try and keep this tight if you can and
then<00:01:15.520> over<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.000> front<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.899> first

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
then over the front that's the first

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.910 
then over the front that's the first
part<00:01:20.409> they're<00:01:20.649> not<00:01:20.680> set<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.530> keep<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
part they're not set if you keep this

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.249 
part they're not set if you keep this
tight<00:01:24.280> now<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.450> all<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.600> way<00:01:25.750> through<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
tight now and all the way through the

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.050 
tight now and all the way through the
knot<00:01:26.439> it's<00:01:26.649> much<00:01:26.950> easier<00:01:27.399> because<00:01:27.729> it's<00:01:27.880> hard

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
knot it's much easier because it's hard

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540 
knot it's much easier because it's hard
to<00:01:28.210> tighten<00:01:28.569> afterwards<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.830> now<00:01:30.039> we<00:01:30.369> just

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
to tighten afterwards and now we just

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.980 
to tighten afterwards and now we just
want<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.789> take<00:01:30.880> out<00:01:31.060> working<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.659> follow

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
want to take out working in to follow

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.090 
want to take out working in to follow
that<00:01:32.289> bottom<00:01:32.619> loop<00:01:32.800> around<00:01:34.679> but<00:01:35.679> make<00:01:35.890> that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
that bottom loop around but make that

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.279 
that bottom loop around but make that
loop<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.460> little<00:01:36.700> bit<00:01:36.970> smaller<00:01:37.270> socks<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
loop a little bit smaller socks on the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.889 
loop a little bit smaller socks on the
inside<00:01:39.330> off<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.390> first<00:01:40.990> one<00:01:42.569> and<00:01:43.569> then<00:01:43.750> again

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
inside off the first one and then again

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.029 
inside off the first one and then again
we<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.350> take<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.649> around<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> back<00:01:45.130> and

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
we can take it around the back and

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.529 
we can take it around the back and
around<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.250> front<00:01:48.459> keeping<00:01:49.209> it<00:01:49.360> nice<00:01:49.479> and

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
around the front keeping it nice and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.100 
around the front keeping it nice and
tight

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.170 

and<00:01:56.620> then<00:01:56.800> follow<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.310> loop<00:01:57.460> around<00:01:57.640> again

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.220 

again<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> smaller<00:02:01.690> loop<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.750> just<00:02:04.780> keep

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
again a smaller loop and just keep

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.330 
again a smaller loop and just keep
following<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.710> same<00:02:06.160> pattern<00:02:08.130> around<00:02:09.130> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
following that same pattern around the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.590 
following that same pattern around the
background<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.970> front<00:02:12.090> followed<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.390> loop

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
background the front followed that loop

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.720 
background the front followed that loop
around<00:02:17.370> until<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.510> center<00:02:19.990> hole<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
around until you get that center hole is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.780 
around until you get that center hole is
quite<00:02:22.210> small<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.820> then<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:27.550> want<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
quite small and then you just want to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.370 
quite small and then you just want to
tuck<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.690> working<00:02:29.050> end<00:02:29.260> down<00:02:29.770> through<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
tuck the working end down through that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.830 
tuck the working end down through that
center<00:02:32.770> hole<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:39.520> there<00:02:39.790> once<00:02:40.360> you've<00:02:40.600> worked

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
center hole and there once you've worked

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.040 
center hole and there once you've worked
or<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> little<00:02:41.500> bit

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
or not a little bit

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.760 
or not a little bit
you<00:02:44.050> should<00:02:44.320> find<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:46.240> have<00:02:46.390> your<00:02:46.690> finished
