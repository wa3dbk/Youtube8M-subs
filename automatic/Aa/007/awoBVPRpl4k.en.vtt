00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
built for the lane and started getting a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
built for the lane and started getting a
CS<00:00:36.000> avenge<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.750> turret<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.320> basically

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
CS avenge got that turret and basically

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
CS avenge got that turret and basically
all<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.129> lanes<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.550> across<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.090> board<00:00:39.329> there

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
all the lanes one across the board there

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
all the lanes one across the board there
for<00:00:39.780> Team<00:00:39.960> Liquid<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.800> ended<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.160> not

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
for Team Liquid and they ended up not

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
for Team Liquid and they ended up not
pushing<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> advantage<00:00:42.300> too<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
pushing that advantage too much it was a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
pushing that advantage too much it was a
slow<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.559> steady<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:43.980> even<00:00:44.460> though<00:00:44.550> there

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
slow but steady thing even though there

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.979 
slow but steady thing even though there
was<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> team<00:00:45.329> fight<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> end<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was only one team fight at the end that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
was only one team fight at the end that
really<00:00:46.350> blew<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> long<00:00:48.239> time

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
really blew things up it was a long time

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
really blew things up it was a long time
coming<00:00:48.629> Team<00:00:49.410> Liquid<00:00:49.559> had<00:00:49.860> prepped<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
coming Team Liquid had prepped for that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.889 
coming Team Liquid had prepped for that
fight<00:00:50.579> through<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.360> every<00:00:51.539> possible

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
fight through basically every possible

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
fight through basically every possible
way<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.140> could<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> setup<00:00:53.070> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
way they could have so the setup for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
way they could have so the setup for
that<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.699> moment<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.690> needed<00:00:54.719> an

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that one moment was all they needed an

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
that one moment was all they needed an
hot<00:00:55.530> shot<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.489> more

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
hot shot I think even a little bit more

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.830 
hot shot I think even a little bit more
questionable<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:57.809> into

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
questionable when we take into

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
questionable when we take into
consideration<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> fact<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.190> impulse<00:00:59.969> has

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
consideration the fact that impulse has

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
consideration the fact that impulse has
been<00:01:00.570> performing<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.829> early<00:01:01.859> game

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
been performing well in the early game

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.709 
been performing well in the early game
that's<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.090> been<00:01:03.239> establishing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that's where they had been establishing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's where they had been establishing
their<00:01:03.930> leads<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> getting<00:01:04.589> their<00:01:04.710> wins<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
their leads and getting their wins but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.350 
their leads and getting their wins but
if<00:01:05.220> they're<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.369> setting<00:01:05.820> themselves<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.299> for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
if they're not setting themselves up for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
if they're not setting themselves up for
strong<00:01:06.780> lanes<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:08.880> like

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
strong lanes then they do go down like

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.370 
strong lanes then they do go down like
they<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.600> against<00:01:09.869> Team<00:01:09.990> Liquid<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
they did against Team Liquid and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380 
they did against Team Liquid and
ultimately<00:01:10.890> team<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> rolls<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.670> yeah

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
ultimately team with the rolls over yeah

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
ultimately team with the rolls over yeah
impact<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> stronger<00:01:13.650> early<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
impact has a stronger early game and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
impact has a stronger early game and
then<00:01:14.640> TL<00:01:15.000> has<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> better<00:01:15.450> late<00:01:15.720> game<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> t<00:01:16.229> play

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
then TL has a better late game in t play

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
then TL has a better late game in t play
so<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.330> down<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.780> impact

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
so it really it's really down to impact

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.070 
so it really it's really down to impact
to<00:01:19.380> work<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> their<00:01:20.369> strengths<00:01:20.850> other<00:01:21.270> instead

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to work to their strengths other instead

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
to work to their strengths other instead
of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> weaknesses<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> feel<00:01:24.119> like

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
of the weaknesses right and I feel like

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
of the weaknesses right and I feel like
rush<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.960> invisible<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.530> game<00:01:25.710> he<00:01:25.890> had

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
rush was also invisible this game he had

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
rush was also invisible this game he had
some<00:01:26.250> deal<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:26.759> could<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.090> made<00:01:27.270> bottom

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
some deal that he could have made bottom

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
some deal that he could have made bottom
Lane<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:28.259> waited<00:01:28.560> too<00:01:28.829> long<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> feel

control<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> lane<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.030> even<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> saw<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
control the lane like even a you saw the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.930 
control the lane like even a you saw the
shed<00:02:10.050> matchup<00:02:10.470> he<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.950> bowling<00:02:11.340> he's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.430 
shed matchup he was bowling he's
bullying<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:12.690> hard<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
bullying really hard and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.070 
bullying really hard and
that<00:02:14.100> allows<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.240> jungler<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> come<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:15.870> for

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
that allows the jungler to come in for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.510 
that allows the jungler to come in for
the<00:02:16.140> kill<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.310> don't<00:02:17.430> have

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the kill right and if you don't have

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
the kill right and if you don't have
that<00:02:17.640> you're<00:02:17.820> done<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.270> also<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.600> great

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
that you're done but also a great

adjustment<00:02:19.050> bind<00:02:19.710> teamliquid<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.400> called<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
adjustment bind teamliquid you called it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.400 
adjustment bind teamliquid you called it
out<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.240> pregame<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.080> see<00:02:22.230> perhaps

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
out in the pregame I want to see perhaps

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320 
out in the pregame I want to see perhaps
the<00:02:22.740> Sirocco<00:02:23.040> ban<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.400> saw<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the Sirocco ban we saw as well as a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
the Sirocco ban we saw as well as a
chance<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.080> saw<00:02:25.260> both<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.530> those<00:02:25.800> come<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
chance we saw both of those come out and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.090 
chance we saw both of those come out and
it<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.030> did<00:02:27.300> seem<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.600> hinder<00:02:28.320> impulse<00:02:28.770> in

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
it really did seem to hinder impulse in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.440 
it really did seem to hinder impulse in
their<00:02:29.430> flexibility<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.180> aggressive

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
their flexibility to be aggressive

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.900 
their flexibility to be aggressive
having<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> shen<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:32.010> always<00:02:32.520> be<00:02:32.700> able<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
having the shen to always be able to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.970 
having the shen to always be able to
make<00:02:33.000> an<00:02:33.210> appearance<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.780> any<00:02:34.050> length<00:02:34.380> yeah<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
make an appearance in any length yeah I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.080 
make an appearance in any length yeah I
feel<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.490> take<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:35.910> those

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
feel like when you take out those

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.090 
feel like when you take out those
variables<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> other<00:02:36.900> lanes<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.740> really

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
variables for the other lanes you really

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
variables for the other lanes you really
can<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.430> focus<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.910> winning<00:02:39.660> those<00:02:39.960> lanes

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
can just focus on winning those lanes

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.200 
can just focus on winning those lanes
because<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.530> mean<00:02:40.680> gate<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> also<00:02:41.820> somebody<00:02:42.030> who

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
because I mean gate is also somebody who

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.580 
because I mean gate is also somebody who
seems<00:02:42.450> very<00:02:42.570> one-dimensional<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.440> now

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
seems very one-dimensional right now

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740 
seems very one-dimensional right now
right<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.580> give<00:02:44.760> them<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> victor<00:02:45.270> band

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
right you can give them the victor band

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.060 
right you can give them the victor band
the<00:02:45.870> easier<00:02:46.230> your<00:02:46.500> they're<00:02:46.680> gonna<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:46.980> the
