guy Jonas wants to know how i got from
600,000<00:00:16.980> polygons<00:00:17.400> 295<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> polygon<00:00:18.420> still

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
600,000 polygons 295 the polygon still

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
600,000 polygons 295 the polygon still
and<00:00:19.820> all<00:00:20.820> right<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.670> way<00:00:23.789> i<00:00:23.850> did<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.840> I

and all right the way i did that was I
used<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> McCall<00:00:26.300> don't<00:00:27.300> move<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:29.240> move<00:00:30.240> some

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
used to McCall don't move up move some

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.700 
used to McCall don't move up move some
folder<00:00:31.529> somewhere<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.690> yeah<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.290> use

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
folder somewhere and yeah just I use

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 
folder somewhere and yeah just I use
something<00:00:34.950> called<00:00:35.100> decimation<00:00:36.000> master<00:00:36.540> I'll

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
something called decimation master I'll

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
something called decimation master I'll
just<00:00:37.469> open<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.100> scrub<00:00:40.370> finger<00:00:41.370> system

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
just open up this scrub finger system

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
just open up this scrub finger system
right<00:00:42.090> file<00:00:42.800> soon<00:00:43.800> find<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> thing<00:00:47.489> about

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
right file soon find out the thing about

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
right file soon find out the thing about
using<00:00:47.850> decimation<00:00:48.539> master<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.680> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
using decimation master is that are it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.860 
using decimation master is that are it's
a<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:52.340> destructive<00:00:53.340> sort<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> edit<00:00:54.600> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
a pretty destructive sort of edit on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
a pretty destructive sort of edit on
your<00:00:55.079> model<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> only<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.129> use

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
your model you can only really use

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.099 
your model you can only really use
decimation<00:00:56.969> master<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.899> rendering<00:00:58.820> or

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
decimation master for like rendering or

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
decimation master for like rendering or
as<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.260> used<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> sort<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> reference

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
as I used it to as a sort of reference

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.899 
as I used it to as a sort of reference
model<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.439> wheat<00:01:04.650> apologizing<00:01:05.400> stuff

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.350 

let<00:01:08.909> me<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.150> saw<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.840> off<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.080> body<00:01:11.360> my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
let me just saw them off this body my

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
let me just saw them off this body my
category<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.229> shall<00:01:13.560> turn<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> body

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
category and we shall turn off the body

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
category and we shall turn off the body
paint<00:01:15.299> van<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> yeah<00:01:18.270> currently<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
paint van now so yeah currently this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.570 
paint van now so yeah currently this
model<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> particular<00:01:21.000> sub<00:01:21.720> tool<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
model this particular sub tool is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.660 
model this particular sub tool is
approximately<00:01:24.500> nine<00:01:25.500> point<00:01:26.009> eight<00:01:26.220> million

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
approximately nine point eight million

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359 
approximately nine point eight million
polygons<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:28.860> sort<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
polygons so it's pretty sort of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
polygons so it's pretty sort of
heavy-duty<00:01:29.909> density<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> able

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
heavy-duty density you will be able

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.069 
heavy-duty density you will be able
users<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.189> 3d<00:01:32.850> max<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.509> whatever<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
users in my or 3d max or whatever and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.609 
users in my or 3d max or whatever and
all<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> did<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.579> lower<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.990> polygon<00:01:37.380> count

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
all I did to lower the the polygon count

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.730 
all I did to lower the the polygon count
and<00:01:37.799> retain<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> detail<00:01:38.659> was<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:39.990> in

decimation master does is it takes a

we go sort of think about for a few

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.460 
we go sort of think about for a few
seconds<00:03:38.699> but<00:03:38.879> like<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.150> say<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:40.229> know<00:03:40.379> what

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
seconds but like I say I don't know what

your intended uses Ferrari decimating
you<00:03:45.930> can't<00:03:46.169> really<00:03:46.349> use<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.769> as<00:03:46.919> like<00:03:47.189> a<00:03:47.220> game

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you can't really use it as like a game

you can't really use it as like a game

won't and I made properly but it is

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.460 
won't and I made properly but it is

you<00:03:57.599> know<00:03:57.629> all<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.049> cool<00:03:58.560> sort<00:03:58.949> of<00:03:59.009> rendering

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
you know all the cool sort of rendering

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.999 
you know all the cool sort of rendering
capabilities<00:04:00.379> you<00:04:01.379> know<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.650> final

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
capabilities you know like final

government stuff but yeah decimate
current<00:04:05.400> okay<00:04:05.669> now<00:04:05.849> you've<00:04:05.970> got<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> pre

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
current okay now you've got a pre

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.439 
current okay now you've got a pre
process<00:04:06.659> done<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.769> option<00:04:07.949> here

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
process done you have the option here

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.789 
process done you have the option here
basically<00:04:09.449> if<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:09.750> screw<00:04:10.290> up<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.500> down<00:04:10.620> here

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799

basically if you screw up and down here
it's<00:04:11.009> cool<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.189> try<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.870> keep<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> polygon

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
it's cool to try and keep the polygon

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.379 
it's cool to try and keep the polygon
count<00:04:13.590> too<00:04:13.889> why<00:04:14.310> were<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.519> go<00:04:14.639> send<00:04:14.909> here<00:04:15.209> I

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
count too why were you go send here I

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.659 
count too why were you go send here I
usually<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.139> find<00:04:16.470> twenty<00:04:16.859> percent<00:04:17.070> you

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
usually just find twenty percent you

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.849 
usually just find twenty percent you
know<00:04:17.729> decent<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.389> twenty<00:04:19.320> percent<00:04:19.469> lasting

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450 
pretty successful we've got a Nepali for
him<00:04:30.419> here<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:31.199> see<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:32.130> topology<00:04:32.400> of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
him here you can see the the topology of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.830 
him here you can see the the topology of
this<00:04:32.880> match<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.330> really<00:04:33.810> sort<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.560> messed<00:04:35.840> just

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
this match is really sort of messed just

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.659 
this match is really sort of messed just
course<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.320> using<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.009> chaotic

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
course it is using the chaotic

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.610 
course it is using the chaotic
arrangements<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.360> like<00:04:39.509> triangles<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.259> you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
arrangements of like triangles to you

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.170 
arrangements of like triangles to you
know<00:04:40.710> keep<00:04:40.889> all<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> detail<00:04:41.490> all<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.729> surface

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
know keep all the detail all the surface

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.040 
know keep all the detail all the surface
stuff<00:04:43.430> yes<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.699> if<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.539> want<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.690> go<00:04:45.780> lower

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
stuff yes so if you want to go lower

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.340 
stuff yes so if you want to go lower
always<00:04:46.710> take<00:04:47.009> a<00:04:47.039> new<00:04:47.600> pre-process<00:04:48.600> if<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.139> try

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
always take a new pre-process if you try

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.390 
always take a new pre-process if you try
and<00:04:49.410> decimate<00:04:50.150> again<00:04:51.150> using<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.960> old<00:04:52.400> process

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
and decimate again using the old process

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.439 
and decimate again using the old process
if<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.000> took<00:04:54.060> it's<00:04:54.570> going<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.110> be<00:04:55.199> using<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
if I took it's going to be using the

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.999 
if I took it's going to be using the
computed<00:04:57.449> results<00:04:58.229> from<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.830> higher

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
computed results from the higher

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.710 
computed results from the higher
resolution<00:04:59.580> because<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.880> topologies<00:05:00.419> change

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
resolution because the topologies change

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.909 
resolution because the topologies change
so<00:05:00.990> much<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:02.610> won't<00:05:02.940> decimate<00:05:03.830> accordingly<00:05:04.830> so

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
so much it won't decimate accordingly so

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.100 
so much it won't decimate accordingly so
you<00:05:05.759> need<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.000> pre-process<00:05:06.389> this<00:05:06.840> new

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
you need to pre-process this new

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.520 
you need to pre-process this new
topology<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.820> order<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.449> like<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.139> know<00:05:10.169> get<00:05:10.470> a

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
topology in order to like you know get a

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.879 
topology in order to like you know get a
cleaner<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.820> more<00:05:11.849> accurate<00:05:12.509> result<00:05:12.889> don't

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
cleaner and more accurate result don't

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.260 
cleaner and more accurate result don't
take<00:05:14.009> long<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.370> lower<00:05:14.520> polygons<00:05:15.030> as<00:05:15.150> it

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
take long the lower polygons as it

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.810 
take long the lower polygons as it
quickly<00:05:15.449> goes<00:05:16.009> decimate<00:05:17.009> again<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.610> died

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
quickly goes decimate again and died

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.980 
quickly goes decimate again and died
twenty<00:05:18.539> twenty<00:05:19.500> seven<00:05:19.830> thousand<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:21.870> is

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
twenty twenty seven thousand and it is

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.270 
twenty twenty seven thousand and it is
still<00:05:22.229> pretty<00:05:22.410> decent<00:05:22.889> you<00:05:22.979> know<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.130> could

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
still pretty decent you know you could

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.430 
still pretty decent you know you could
render<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.610> out<00:05:23.729> in<00:05:23.970> Maya<00:05:24.180> whatever<00:05:24.660> way

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
render that out in Maya whatever way

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.790 
render that out in Maya whatever way
verse<00:05:25.650> or<00:05:25.889> package<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.340> use<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.680> is

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
verse or package you use and that is

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.189 
verse or package you use and that is
that's<00:05:29.099> pretty<00:05:29.370> much<00:05:29.430> decimation<00:05:29.880> master<00:05:30.360> you

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
that's pretty much decimation master you

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.770 
that's pretty much decimation master you
will<00:05:31.349> lose<00:05:31.590> all<00:05:31.979> poly<00:05:32.639> paint<00:05:32.909> information<00:05:33.479> as

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
will lose all poly paint information as

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.250 
will lose all poly paint information as
poly<00:05:34.500> pain<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:35.300> literally<00:05:36.300> colorizing<00:05:37.110> each

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
poly pain is literally colorizing each

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.560 
poly pain is literally colorizing each
polygon<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:38.039> you<00:05:38.520> know<00:05:38.639> lower<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.419> less

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
polygon so you know lower the less

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.659 
polygon so you know lower the less
polygons<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.110> have<00:05:40.289> it's<00:05:40.590> going<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.800> there's

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
polygons you have it's going to there's

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.510 
polygons you have it's going to there's
just<00:05:41.760> no<00:05:41.880> way<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.229> don't<00:05:43.440> know<00:05:43.530> there's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
just no way for it I don't know there's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.140 
just no way for it I don't know there's
no<00:05:44.669> way<00:05:44.789> for<00:05:44.849> its<00:05:45.060> computer<00:05:45.659> at<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.169> point

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
no way for its computer at this point

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.490 
no way for its computer at this point
but<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.210> que<00:05:48.389> se<00:05:48.659> è<00:05:48.690> doesn't<00:05:49.199> really<00:05:49.320> matter

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
but I que se è doesn't really matter

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.810 
but I que se è doesn't really matter
this<00:05:49.710> is<00:05:49.770> purely<00:05:50.190> for<00:05:50.580> test<00:05:51.419> rendering<00:05:52.020> or<00:05:52.820> no

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
this is purely for test rendering or no

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.909 
this is purely for test rendering or no
it's<00:05:54.000> just<00:05:54.120> general<00:05:54.870> presentation<00:05:55.229> sort<00:05:55.860> of

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
it's just general presentation sort of

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.050 
it's just general presentation sort of
thing<00:05:56.039> you<00:05:56.130> know<00:05:56.220> just<00:05:56.370> making<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.820> bit<00:05:56.970> more

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
thing you know just making a bit more

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.610 
thing you know just making a bit more
useful<00:05:57.479> I'll<00:05:57.720> see<00:05:57.870> that's<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.169> only<00:05:58.409> use

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
useful I'll see that's the only use

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.719 
useful I'll see that's the only use
decimation<00:05:59.310> has<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:01.080> reach<00:06:01.740> apologizing<00:06:02.490> in

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
decimation has and reach apologizing in

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.800 
decimation has and reach apologizing in
like<00:06:03.150> top<00:06:03.690> Hogan<00:06:04.050> or<00:06:04.289> whatever<00:06:04.770> it<00:06:04.830> is<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.070> use

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
like top Hogan or whatever it is you use

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.180 
like top Hogan or whatever it is you use
yeah<00:06:06.810> that's<00:06:06.960> pretty<00:06:07.050> much<00:06:07.139> it<00:06:07.229> decimation

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
yeah that's pretty much it decimation

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.089 
yeah that's pretty much it decimation
Muslim<00:06:08.630> hope<00:06:09.630> that's<00:06:09.840> helpful<00:06:10.139> to<00:06:10.889> any

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099
