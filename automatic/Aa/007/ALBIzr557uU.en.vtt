00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
filter I don't know if it was a little

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.310 
filter I don't know if it was a little
longer<00:00:13.710> if<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.460> hose<00:00:14.700> leading<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.900> it

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
longer if the hose leading to it

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
longer if the hose leading to it
they<00:00:16.680> came<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.910> bit

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
they came with it was a little bit

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
they came with it was a little bit
longer<00:00:18.300> love<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> turn<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
longer love but it I had to turn it a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
longer love but it I had to turn it a
little<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.390> differently<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> was

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
little bit differently than it was

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.740 
little bit differently than it was
originally<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> had<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.150> run<00:00:24.330> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
originally and I had to run kind of a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.099 
originally and I had to run kind of a
longer<00:00:25.019> fuel<00:00:25.439> line<00:00:26.119> up<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> fuel<00:00:27.720> input

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
longer fuel line up for the fuel input

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.060 
longer fuel line up for the fuel input
to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> carburetor<00:00:30.289> but<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> looks<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to the carburetor but it looks like it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.360 
to the carburetor but it looks like it
should<00:00:32.099> work<00:00:32.340> okay<00:00:33.320> got<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> return<00:00:34.620> line<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
should work okay got the return line and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.410 
should work okay got the return line and
the<00:00:35.430> fuel<00:00:35.670> input<00:00:36.090> line<00:00:36.329> hooked<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:38.420> one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the fuel input line hooked back up one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
the fuel input line hooked back up one
thing<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.750> noticed<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.320> took<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
thing I noticed when I took the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
thing I noticed when I took the
alternator<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> make<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.730> easier<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.270> get

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
alternator off to make it easier to get

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
alternator off to make it easier to get
to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> fuel<00:00:42.989> pump<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.190> noticed<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to the fuel pump and I noticed that this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.029 
to the fuel pump and I noticed that this
bolt<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.780> supposed<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.890> was

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bolt that's supposed to be on here was

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.670 
bolt that's supposed to be on here was
missing<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.989> bolt<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
missing this this bolt here was just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
missing this this bolt here was just
sitting<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.190> top<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.730> bracket<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sitting on top of this bracket so the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
sitting on top of this bracket so the
alternator<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> air<00:00:53.129> conditioning<00:00:53.640> belts

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
alternator and air conditioning belts

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
alternator and air conditioning belts
are<00:00:54.120> coming<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.840> ended<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.320> being<00:00:55.530> kind<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
are coming on or ended up being kind of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
are coming on or ended up being kind of
loose<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.370> why<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> didn't<00:00:56.820> see

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
loose and I don't know why I didn't see

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.779 
loose and I don't know why I didn't see
that<00:00:57.030> before<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.670> would

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that before you think that they would

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.910 
that before you think that they would
put<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> bolts<00:01:00.660> back<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.469> went<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
put all the bolts back when they went to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
put all the bolts back when they went to
repair<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.420> put<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
repair was down I think this was put in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.550 
repair was down I think this was put in
a<00:01:03.870> 97<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.110> apparently<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.530> put<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
a 97 or so but apparently not so I put a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
a 97 or so but apparently not so I put a
bolt<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> may<00:01:12.060> try<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.630> try<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
bolt in here I may try I'm gonna try to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
bolt in here I may try I'm gonna try to
see<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> better<00:01:13.860> bolt<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> fits

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
see if I can get a better bolt that fits

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.990 
see if I can get a better bolt that fits
better<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:17.820> work

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
better but this will this will work

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
better but this will this will work
temporarily<00:01:18.960> talk<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> better<00:01:19.979> bolt

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
temporarily talk and get a better bolt

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
temporarily talk and get a better bolt
on<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.689> sure<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> original<00:01:22.619> setup

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
on there not sure of the original setup

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
on there not sure of the original setup
of<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> looks<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.060> could<00:01:24.360> have

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
of this it looks like this could have

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
of this it looks like this could have
fit<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.350> groove<00:01:25.680> without<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
fit down into this groove without this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.420 
fit down into this groove without this
extension<00:01:26.549> piece<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.740> maybe<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.189> done

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
extension piece here but maybe it's done

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.300 
extension piece here but maybe it's done
to<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.790> belt<00:01:30.090> clearance<00:01:30.600> around<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:32.159> the

to get belt clearance around the on the
water<00:01:32.520> pump<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.520> gonna<00:01:35.780> go<00:01:36.780> ahead

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
water pump there so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.069 
water pump there so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:40.850> get<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and try it now I get that you get the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.700 
and try it now I get that you get the
keys<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.770> pocket<00:01:44.070> here

starts up really easily the first time I
tried<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.250> took<00:02:12.310> some<00:02:12.730> cranking<00:02:13.269> though<00:02:13.420> to

but I think this would do it I'm gonna
get<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> chance<00:02:52.110> I'll<00:02:52.379> go<00:02:52.500> ahead<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.920> give<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.069> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
get a chance I'll go ahead and give it a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
get a chance I'll go ahead and give it a
road<00:02:53.489> test<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.959> make<00:02:55.170> sure<00:02:56.900> they're<00:02:57.900> driving

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
road test just make sure they're driving

road test just make sure they're driving
it<00:02:58.379> down<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> driveway<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.250> seems<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.700> drive

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
it down the driveway it seems to drive

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.910 
it down the driveway it seems to drive
fine

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.610 

you'll<00:03:03.430> calm<00:03:03.700> prepare<00:03:04.209> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.920 

it<00:03:08.069> definitely<00:03:08.250> was<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> leakage<00:03:09.180> problem<00:03:09.690> so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it definitely was a leakage problem so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.860 
it definitely was a leakage problem so
we'll<00:03:10.080> see<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:11.000> fixes<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.209> problem<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
we'll see if that fixes the problem that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.830 
we'll see if that fixes the problem that
was<00:03:13.019> going<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.409> with<00:03:13.620> this
