00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.210
 hallux valgus is a deformity 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.090
 characterized by a deviation of the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 light that tends to converge towards the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 other companies as a result of this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 deviation creates a prominence between the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 light and the metatarsus that immediately to the bone 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.260
 behind the light itself this 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.470
 prominence can be a cause of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 difficulty in wearing shoes 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.170
 adequate in such a way that they are created 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.039
 of inflammatory reactions on the head 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 of the metatarsal other cause of pain 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.160
 which can determine the hallux valgus 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is a pain below the heads of the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.050
 metatarsals second third because 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.059
 hallux valgus and a finger that no longer does 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 your work accordingly 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.430
 transfers the load to the heads 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.640
 nearby metatarsals that become painful 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.780
 so when there are problems 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.050
 or metatarsalgia or pain at the level 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.450
 of the prominence of the first metatarsal 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.060
 these are the conditions they bring 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.789
 the need to intervene 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.429
 surgically for the correction of 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.649
 deformity from the point of view of 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.709
 deformity correction 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.149
 surgically they have been described 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.810
 many interventions but nowadays 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.509
 what is certainly the least intervention 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 invasive is that represented by 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.050
 so-called serious series to an acronym that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.509
 means simple effective and rapid e 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.060
 from English to expansive even a little 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.599
 expensive this type of intervention 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.030
 through a mini incision allows 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.670
 to correct all who are i 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 parameters that must be corrected in 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.470
 characteristic deformity of the hallux 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.009
 valgus 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.759
 after surgery it is possible to walk 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 immediately 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.430
 naturally protected by adequate 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.260
 footwear that must be worn 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.099
 for a period of one month 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.769
 and then some but will have to be performed 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.659
 few exercises from the point of view 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:31.200
 rehabilitation will be 2014 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.349
 watershed in most western countries 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.269
 by 50 percent the population will have more 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.659
 45 years old 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.349
 at this point since the population 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.480
 it ages but on the other side wants 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.480
 maintain quality of life 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.060
 on the other side he wants to protect and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.909
 It is the recommended physical activity 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.909
 is recommended motorcycle and anything else 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.879
 what are the things there? 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.250
 interventions that a normal person 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.840
 should follow to improve his 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 quality of life and having an expectation 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:13.079
 also of greater life but I believe that to 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.409
 this improvement will have to 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.260
 contribute a little everyone because it will be there 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.260
 a contribution regarding 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.599
 the evolution of drugs will be there 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.379
 an evolution regarding 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.319
 the power supply there will be changes 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:34.220
 in materials for the use of aids 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.510
 orthopedic type that will facilitate 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.419
 they will better compensate those that can 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.250
 be some issues that yes 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.780
 progressively occur in the course 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.090
 of the year 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.340
 of course there will always be a greater 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.199
 commitment also from the point of view 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.010
 rehabilitative because these people 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.849
 they can keep 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.500
 adequate muscle control 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.420
 an adequate situation such as 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.010
 allow us to move more 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.500
 adequately and therefore with less 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.110
 problems of the muscle apparatus 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 skeletal and of course there will be later 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.849
 also an evolution we hope this 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.099
 both the less necessary but also of the 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.950
 surgery that will put more and more to 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.410
 provision of less invasive interventions e 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.510
 that intervention better tolerated to more 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.090
 rapid recovery and is able to 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.100
 compensate to solve what they are 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.889
 unsolvable problems 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.460
 through all the other opportunities 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.460
 which we talked about 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.750
 in foot trauma and operations 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.389
 of hallux valgus 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
 post-surgical treatment passes 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.789
 necessarily through a shoe of 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.449
 adequate discharge the goal is walking 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:58.620
 immediately and without pain in treatment 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.660
 post surgical van asks yes no 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.190
 thirty years ago the patient was forced 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.330
 to stay in bed for at least one 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.350
 week 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.320
 in 1992 at the ispo congress in lisbon 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.199
 we presented the footwear vps which 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.530
 then become standard at the level 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.169
 international in 2008 test 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.919
 biomechanics made in Monaco di 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.229
 bavaria have certified that vps is the 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.280
 best shoe in the panorama 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:34.650
 international ups can give you allows 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.199
 walk immediately reducing the pain 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.780
 resume normal life as soon as possible 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.820
 social is the primary goal in the 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.710
 post surgical treatment in 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.979
 particularly for those most at risk 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.340
 which diabetics and overweight people 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.650
 for this purpose we have undertaken some 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.259
 in-depth studies with the university of 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.280
 bologna movement workshop 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.740
 professor giannini 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.740
 the results are the shoe td 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.030
 stiff biomechanical sole that leaves a 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.110
 rest the object articulation 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.120
 of the operation and facilitates walking 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.180
 plantar wedge that transfers the 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.669
 pressure from the sore foot van 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.260
 hides the clinical tests of 2012 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.050
 made in collaboration with the team 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.650
 Professor Giannini confirmed 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.050
 the effectiveness of the discharge shoe 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.479
 tdt poe from artis guarantees a 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.250
 natural walking without the use of 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:43.960
 crutches preventing postural problems 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.020
 how long I will have to use one 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.210
 post-operative unloading shoe in 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.820
 average four weeks 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.889
 but since normally the foot remains 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.320
 edematous and painful is necessary 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:03.310
 use a suitable shoe for i 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.639
 subsequent 30 60 days pod activity 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:10.630
 artis has been specifically designed with 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:13.630
 seamless lining increased volume 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.449
 and biomechanical sole that facilitates the 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.809
 rolling of the pass 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:24.129
 after foot operation use 

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:27.339
 Tested suitable footwear allows to 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:30.129
 return to everyday life climb the 

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:33.189
 stairs go shopping go by
