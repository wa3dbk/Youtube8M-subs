in<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.580> number<00:00:29.849> five<00:00:30.240> my<00:00:30.480> top<00:00:30.660> five<00:00:30.810> editions

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in at number five my top five editions

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
in at number five my top five editions
and<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> four<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.369> three<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:33.030> two

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and it is the four two three one two

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.660 
and it is the four two three one two
four<00:00:34.050> major<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.130> higher<00:00:35.340> if

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
four major now this would be higher if

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.990 
four major now this would be higher if
it<00:00:36.120> wasn't<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.750> such<00:00:36.960> awkward<00:00:38.000> chemistry

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it wasn't for such awkward chemistry

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
it wasn't for such awkward chemistry
links<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.510> great<00:00:39.750> formation<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> do

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
links it's a great formation if you do

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
links it's a great formation if you do
if<00:00:41.070> she's<00:00:41.219> taken<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.910> legal<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.420> later

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
if she's taken to a one legal one later

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.770 
if she's taken to a one legal one later
side<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.829> feel<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> works<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.579> well<00:00:44.780> but

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
side and I feel it works really well but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
side and I feel it works really well but
the<00:00:46.020> fact<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> cam<00:00:46.950> has<00:00:47.190> seven<00:00:47.640> links

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the fact that that cam has seven links

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.160 
the fact that that cam has seven links
coming<00:00:48.090> off<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.660> means<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.020> an

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
coming off me just means it's an

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.910 
coming off me just means it's an
absolute<00:00:49.649> nightmare<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:51.440> various<00:00:52.440> hybrids

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
absolute nightmare for various hybrids

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
absolute nightmare for various hybrids
that<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> haven't<00:00:54.809> used<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that I like to do so I haven't used it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260 
that I like to do so I haven't used it
as<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.649> year<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.550> otherwise

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
as much this year as I would otherwise

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
as much this year as I would otherwise
live<00:00:57.719> life<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.129> happy

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
live life to use that I was really happy

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
live life to use that I was really happy
when<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.609> brought<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.059> new<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> year<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
when they brought in new this year and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
when they brought in new this year and
just<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.859> chem<00:01:02.010> shillings<00:01:02.370> makes<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.879> awkward

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
just the chem shillings makes it awkward

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.530 
just the chem shillings makes it awkward
for<00:01:03.449> me<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.369> number<00:01:05.729> four<00:01:06.180> we

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
for me but then in at number four we

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
for me but then in at number four we
have<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:06.869> 352<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> need<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> to

have got 352 now when I need you to
three<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.390> formation<00:01:10.020> 352<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> formation

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
three but formation 352 is the formation
