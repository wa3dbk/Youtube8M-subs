paper and you're going to want to cut it

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.180 
paper and you're going to want to cut it
right<00:00:15.450> down<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> middle<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.529> i<00:00:16.859> recommend

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
right down the middle so i recommend

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.450 
right down the middle so i recommend
folding<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:17.970> half<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:19.830> folding<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
folding it in half and then folding it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.160 
folding it in half and then folding it
back<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.910> forth<00:00:21.180> back<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.510> forth<00:00:21.750> back<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
back and forth back and forth back and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400 
back and forth back and forth back and
forth<00:00:22.380> back<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:22.890> forth<00:00:23.510> until<00:00:24.510> its<00:00:24.990> weak<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
forth back and forth until its weak and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
forth back and forth until its weak and
then<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.650> ripping<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:31.340> yeah<00:00:32.540> then<00:00:33.540> rip<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
then just ripping it so yeah then rip it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.370 
then just ripping it so yeah then rip it
but<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> seems<00:00:34.829> weak<00:00:35.250> enough<00:00:36.079> right<00:00:37.079> down<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
but it seems weak enough right down the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.060 
but it seems weak enough right down the
middle<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> i<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.450> mirror<00:00:42.450> image<00:00:43.170> pieces

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
middle so i have to mirror image pieces

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
middle so i have to mirror image pieces
of<00:00:44.100> april<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:45.360> you're<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.870> to

of april now you're going to want to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.260 
of april now you're going to want to
fold<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.780 

then<00:00:56.810> fold<00:00:57.230> one<00:00:57.590> side<00:00:57.790> up<00:00:58.790> like<00:00:59.000> this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.840

then turn it over and do one side like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.870 
then turn it over and do one side like
this<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:06.350> you're<00:01:06.530> not<00:01:06.650> making<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:07.280> oh<00:01:07.460> what's

this so you're not making like oh what's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.170 
this so you're not making like oh what's
a<00:01:08.120> shape<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.630> not<00:01:08.810> like<00:01:09.130> this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.240 

looks<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:13.930> this

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.090 

then<00:01:17.020> you're<00:01:18.020> going<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.230> take<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.740> and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
then you're going to take this and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.560 
then you're going to take this and
you'll<00:01:19.310> make<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> triangle<00:01:19.940> with<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.420> right

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
you'll make a triangle with it right

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.340 
you'll make a triangle with it right
here<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.560> line<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:21.980> line<00:01:22.190> up<00:01:22.370> with<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:22.700> one

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
here and line this line up with this one

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.440 
here and line this line up with this one
make<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> fold<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:25.520> put<00:01:26.120> this<00:01:26.240> other

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
make a fold and then just put this other

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.530 
make a fold and then just put this other
direction<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.850> know<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.060> did<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.330> right

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
direction and you know you did it right

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.130 
direction and you know you did it right
if<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:29.840> makes<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.170> Z<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.120> like<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.690> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
if it makes a Z so okay so like that the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:02:02.280 
if it makes a Z so okay so like that the
same<00:01:34.130> thing<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.670> one

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.680 

then<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.250> Z<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:03.970> your<00:02:04.120> mind<00:02:04.420> put<00:02:04.570> this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
then the Z so then your mind put this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.230 
then the Z so then your mind put this
this<00:02:05.080> one<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.560> bottom<00:02:05.760> we're<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> top

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
this one on the bottom we're on the top

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.330 
this one on the bottom we're on the top
it<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.540> match<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.750> up<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:09.130> kind

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
it and match it up like this and it kind

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
it and match it up like this and it kind
of<00:02:09.399> makes<00:02:09.550> like<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> Nazi<00:02:10.300> sign<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.680> you're

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
of makes like a Nazi sign so what you're

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.120 
of makes like a Nazi sign so what you're
going<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> do<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.160> take<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.550> flop<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:17.130> fold

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
going to do is take this flop and fold

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.640 
going to do is take this flop and fold
it<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> middle<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> really

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it in to the middle this is a really

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.200 
it in to the middle this is a really
hard<00:02:23.800> part<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.460> mean<00:02:24.760> you'll<00:02:24.940> eventually

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
hard part so I mean you'll eventually

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.360 
hard part so I mean you'll eventually
get<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.230> pretty<00:02:26.440> hard<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.160> you're

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
get it but it is pretty hard so you're

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.040 
get it but it is pretty hard so you're
going<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.550> fold<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:28.030> these<00:02:28.450> into<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> middle

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.820 

yeah

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.950 

and<00:02:37.950> that's<00:02:38.760> what<00:02:38.910> your<00:02:39.060> paper<00:02:39.270> ninja<00:02:39.510> star<00:02:39.720> is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
and that's what your paper ninja star is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.240 
and that's what your paper ninja star is
going<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.170> look<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.320> but<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.770> got<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> fold

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
going to look like but you got to fold

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.120 
going to look like but you got to fold
these<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> tabs<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.800> put

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
right down the middle with a stapler and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.020 
right down the middle with a stapler and
I<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.470> make<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.800> cross<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:32.790> another<00:03:33.790> thing

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
I you make it cross and another thing

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670 
I you make it cross and another thing
that<00:03:34.180> makes<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.630> little<00:03:34.810> more<00:03:34.930> Road<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.470> know

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that makes it a little more Road I know

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.290 
that makes it a little more Road I know
is<00:03:36.580> if<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.510> take<00:03:37.720> some<00:03:37.990> tape<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.000> just

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
is if you take some tape and you just

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.490 
is if you take some tape and you just
peel<00:03:40.600> these<00:03:40.750> sides<00:03:41.080> out<00:03:41.320> right<00:03:41.530> here<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:44.350> that

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
peel these sides out right here so that

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
peel these sides out right here so that
air<00:03:44.740> can't<00:03:45.070> get<00:03:45.250> into<00:03:45.550> them<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.400> now

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
air can't get into them like that so now

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.890 
air can't get into them like that so now
that<00:03:51.550> air<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.300> get<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.480> here<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:52.840> smores<00:03:54.900> it's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that air can get in here in smores it's

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.960 
that air can get in here in smores it's
closed<00:03:56.350> off<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.860> just<00:03:57.280> do<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.760> every

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
closed off and just do that to every

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:09.000 
closed off and just do that to every
single<00:03:58.270> one<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.450> them

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.570 

so<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:11.439> trim<00:04:11.739> edge<00:04:11.890> it<00:04:12.099> off<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.459> that's

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
so and then trim edge it off and that's

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.830 
so and then trim edge it off and that's
