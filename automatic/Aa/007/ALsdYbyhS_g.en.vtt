00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.790
 let's do what creamfields is 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.680
 frosting and nothing else I need what it is 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.100
 the cream cheese 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.530
 icing sugar and butter ointment that already 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.200
 I have it here or at room temperature and 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.700
 a little bit of vanilla to flavor and 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.540
 well this will help us to cover 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.680
 our bread our cake 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 let's move on 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 beating what cream cheese is together 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.020
 with the butter we are going to beat it 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020
 until it is creamy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.150
 that is believed more together with the butter 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 we are going to add little by little 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.620
 what is sugar icing 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.939
 at the same time that we will be 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.939
 beating 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:27.910
 and all the sugar that I already put all the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:32.080
 sugar the butter I will add the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.080
 vanilla flavorings 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.620
 I will continue to beat and beat until 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:44.110
 that mix forms like peak spikes 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.110
 soft then until then you're 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.750
 this is optional I'm going to put some 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.340
 droplets but very little lemon just 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 to highlight a little the white color 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.760
 since when we throw the vanilla 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.080
 like what 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.530
 he gets a little coffee then 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.530
 just a little bit 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.939
 and I keep getting 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 Well, I'm already finishing 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.270
 I ended up rather to beat well in a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.470
 principle when you are beating 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.550
 and they add sugar is when they add the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.970
 sugar is all stuck in the blades 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.490
 because a very thick mass is formed but 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.730
 as they go beating they are made 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.610
 more liquid is released more then 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.420
 I looked like this, I'm going to take this 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.110
 refrigerate to have it ready when 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.730
 is it stop me already cold then be it 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.730
 I'm cold and can decorate it
