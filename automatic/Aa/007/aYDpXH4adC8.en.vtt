when<00:00:05.250> most<00:00:05.430> people<00:00:05.549> think<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.029> Viking<00:00:06.420> weapons

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
when most people think of Viking weapons

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.179 
when most people think of Viking weapons
very<00:00:07.230> often<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.649> first<00:00:07.799> thing<00:00:08.040> they<00:00:08.160> think

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
very often the first thing they think

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.580 
very often the first thing they think
about<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> battle-ax<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.200> Vikings

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
about is the battle-ax and the Vikings

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.759 
about is the battle-ax and the Vikings
did<00:00:10.830> use<00:00:11.099> axes<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.910> battle<00:00:12.450> unlike<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> Irish

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
did use axes in battle unlike the Irish

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.279 
did use axes in battle unlike the Irish
the<00:00:14.190> Irish<00:00:14.519> used<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.000> ax<00:00:15.179> as<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> tool<00:00:15.870> for

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the Irish used the ax as a tool for

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
the Irish used the ax as a tool for
cutting<00:00:16.440> wood<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:16.980> not<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> weapon<00:00:17.789> until

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
cutting wood but not as a weapon until

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.870 
cutting wood but not as a weapon until
the<00:00:18.930> Vikings<00:00:19.289> came<00:00:19.529> along<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.340> made<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> really

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the Vikings came along we made a really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
the Vikings came along we made a really
interesting<00:00:21.029> discovery<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> summer<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
interesting discovery in the summer of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.720 
interesting discovery in the summer of
2013<00:00:23.330> when<00:00:24.330> three<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> these<00:00:25.619> Viking<00:00:26.490> battle

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
2013 when three of these Viking battle

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.500 
2013 when three of these Viking battle
axes<00:00:27.240> were<00:00:27.390> found<00:00:27.750> together<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.519> a<00:00:29.519> boat<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
axes were found together in a boat that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.650 
axes were found together in a boat that
had<00:00:30.810> sunk<00:00:31.230> onto<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> bed<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.730> Loch<00:00:33.000> kharab<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
had sunk onto the bed of Loch kharab in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.260 
had sunk onto the bed of Loch kharab in
County<00:00:33.989> Galway<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.399> classic<00:00:35.880> Viking

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
County Galway these are classic Viking

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
County Galway these are classic Viking
axes<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> very<00:00:37.530> large<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> then

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
axes we have a very large one and then

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.060 
axes we have a very large one and then
two<00:00:38.640> smaller<00:00:39.030> ones<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:40.530> case<00:00:40.800> however

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
two smaller ones in this case however

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
two smaller ones in this case however
we're<00:00:41.550> fairly<00:00:41.910> sure<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.350> were

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
we're fairly sure that these were

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.279 
we're fairly sure that these were
actually<00:00:43.969> used<00:00:44.969> by<00:00:45.149> Irish<00:00:45.690> warriors<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
actually used by Irish warriors and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.319 
actually used by Irish warriors and
because<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.190> were<00:00:47.250> preserved<00:00:47.640> underwater

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because they were preserved underwater

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910 
because they were preserved underwater
one<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.110> interesting<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.770> about

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
one of the most interesting things about

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
one of the most interesting things about
them<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> wooden<00:00:51.059> shafts<00:00:51.719> or

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
them is that the wooden shafts or

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.279 
them is that the wooden shafts or
handles<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:53.219> survived<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:55.050> only<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
handles have survived now there's only a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
handles have survived now there's only a
small<00:00:55.500> part<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.969> handle<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.539> each<00:00:57.690> axe<00:00:57.989> at

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
small part of the handle in each axe at

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
small part of the handle in each axe at
the<00:00:58.320> moment<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.430> other

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the moment what we do have other

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
the moment what we do have other
fragments<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.960> hope<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> we'll<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.680> able

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
fragments and we hope that we'll be able

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.539 
fragments and we hope that we'll be able
to<00:01:02.129> reconstruct<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.030> handles<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.229> see

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
to reconstruct the handles and to see

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.920 
to reconstruct the handles and to see
among<00:01:05.549> other<00:01:05.729> things<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.510> long<00:01:06.689> they

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
among other things to see how long they

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.310 
among other things to see how long they
were<00:01:06.990> originally<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
were originally what we think is that in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
were originally what we think is that in
the<00:01:10.439> case<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> relatively<00:01:11.369> small<00:01:11.760> axe<00:01:12.090> heads

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the case of relatively small axe heads

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.810 
the case of relatively small axe heads
such<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> handle<00:01:14.640> would

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
such as this one that the handle would

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
such as this one that the handle would
have<00:01:15.000> been<00:01:15.119> correspondingly<00:01:15.930> short<00:01:16.350> probably

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have been correspondingly short probably

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
have been correspondingly short probably
less<00:01:17.549> than<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> meter<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.450> length<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.680> would

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
less than a meter in length and it would

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
less than a meter in length and it would
have<00:01:19.950> been<00:01:20.009> used<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:21.060> hand<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.650> when

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
have been used in one hand but when

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
have been used in one hand but when
you're<00:01:23.009> dealing<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:23.580> large<00:01:24.060> axe

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you're dealing with a very large axe

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
you're dealing with a very large axe
head<00:01:24.689> such<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.220> quite

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
head such as this one it's quite

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
head such as this one it's quite
possible<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> handle<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:28.020> quite<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> bit

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
possible that the handle was quite a bit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
possible that the handle was quite a bit
longer<00:01:28.909> perhaps<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> metre<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> half

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
longer perhaps over a metre and a half

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.800 
longer perhaps over a metre and a half
in<00:01:31.619> length<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.000> would<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> been<00:01:33.509> held

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
in length and it would have been held

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.429 
in length and it would have been held
with<00:01:34.229> both<00:01:34.530> hands<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.600> if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> imagine<00:01:37.020> an

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
with both hands and if you imagine an

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.920 
with both hands and if you imagine an
axe<00:01:37.619> head<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.040> large<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.759> being<00:01:39.600> swung

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
axe head as large as this being swung

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.440 
axe head as large as this being swung
with<00:01:40.200> both<00:01:40.470> hands<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> very<00:01:41.579> long<00:01:41.880> handle

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
with both hands on a very long handle

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
with both hands on a very long handle
you<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.170> looking<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.890> extremely

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you are looking at an extremely

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
you are looking at an extremely
dangerous<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.630> ferocious<00:01:46.020> weapon<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
dangerous and ferocious weapon that

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
dangerous and ferocious weapon that
could<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> lot<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> damage<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> anybody<00:01:48.990> who

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
could do a lot of damage to anybody who

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.429 
could do a lot of damage to anybody who
is<00:01:49.350> nearby<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.130> should<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:52.079> keeping<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
is nearby I should say we're keeping the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
is nearby I should say we're keeping the
axes<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.000> conservation

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
axes in water because the conservation

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.069 
axes in water because the conservation
process<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.770> still<00:01:56.040> ongoing<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.210> until<00:01:57.930> we

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
process is still ongoing and so until we

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.080 
process is still ongoing and so until we
have<00:01:58.110> completely<00:01:58.770> stabilized<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.790> wooden

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have completely stabilized the wooden

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.959 
have completely stabilized the wooden
handles<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.560> keep<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> wet<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
handles we have to keep it wet when you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.690 
handles we have to keep it wet when you
look<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.509> axes<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
look at these axes you will see that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.809 
look at these axes you will see that
they<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.060> beautifully<00:02:06.750> made<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.950> very

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they are beautifully made and very

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.300 
they are beautifully made and very
elegant<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.330> they're<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:10.310> very

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
elegant but they're also very

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.680 
elegant but they're also very
lightweight<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
lightweight and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.320 
lightweight and
slimline<00:02:13.250> objects<00:02:14.250> now<00:02:14.760> an<00:02:14.940> axe<00:02:15.090> that's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
slimline objects now an axe that's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.350 
slimline objects now an axe that's
designed<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.590> cutting<00:02:16.800> wood<00:02:16.980> will<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.120> much

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
designed for cutting wood will be much

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440 
designed for cutting wood will be much
thicker<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.230> heavier<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.970> has<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> be

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
thicker and heavier because it has to be

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.200 
thicker and heavier because it has to be
it's<00:02:21.600> absorbing<00:02:22.230> very<00:02:22.500> heavy<00:02:22.910> impact<00:02:23.910> blows

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it's absorbing very heavy impact blows

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.990 
it's absorbing very heavy impact blows
when<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> when<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.110> strike<00:02:25.410> wood<00:02:25.710> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
when you when you strike wood a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400 
when you when you strike wood a
battle-axe<00:02:27.000> doesn't<00:02:27.420> need<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.170> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
battle-axe doesn't need to be like that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.870 
battle-axe doesn't need to be like that
in<00:02:28.530> fact<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.460> as<00:02:29.610> light<00:02:29.820> as

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
in fact you need it to be as light as

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.410 
in fact you need it to be as light as
possible<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.100> axe

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
possible and you can see that this axe

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.270 
possible and you can see that this axe
is<00:02:33.420> only<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.050> barely<00:02:34.350> thicker<00:02:34.830> than<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
is only just barely thicker than the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.220 
is only just barely thicker than the
wooden<00:02:35.460> handle<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.360> got<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.750> minimum

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
wooden handle it's got the minimum

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.350 
wooden handle it's got the minimum
amount<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.680> weight<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
amount of weight in it and all the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.720 
amount of weight in it and all the
emphasis<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:40.050> actually<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.250> cutting<00:02:41.610> edge

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
emphasis is actually on the cutting edge

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.610 
emphasis is actually on the cutting edge
it's<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.300> extremely<00:02:42.840> wide<00:02:43.230> cutting

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it's got this extremely wide cutting

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.220 
it's got this extremely wide cutting
edge<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.550> you've<00:02:44.760> got<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.330> maximum<00:02:45.750> amount<00:02:46.020> of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
edge so you've got the maximum amount of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830 
edge so you've got the maximum amount of
cutting<00:02:46.710> edge<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> minimum<00:02:48.210> amount<00:02:48.360> of

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
cutting edge for the minimum amount of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080 
cutting edge for the minimum amount of
weight<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.860> that's<00:02:50.220> exactly<00:02:50.550> what<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.000> would

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
weight and that's exactly what you would

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.170 
weight and that's exactly what you would
expect<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.380> battle<00:02:53.130> axe<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:53.760> clearly

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
expect in a battle axe so it's clearly

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.750 
expect in a battle axe so it's clearly
has<00:02:54.480> been<00:02:54.510> designed<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.070> purpose<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
has been designed for that purpose and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.020 
has been designed for that purpose and
for<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.120> purpose<00:02:57.420> alone<00:02:57.860> axes<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.100> many<00:02:59.790> ways

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
for that purpose alone axes in many ways

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.300 
for that purpose alone axes in many ways
were<00:03:00.420> intended<00:03:01.410> as<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> cheaper<00:03:02.040> substitute

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
were intended as a cheaper substitute

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.090 
were intended as a cheaper substitute
for<00:03:02.970> swords<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.600> sword<00:03:04.290> was<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> very<00:03:04.800> expensive

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
for swords a sword was a very expensive

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.580 
for swords a sword was a very expensive
item<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.790> not<00:03:06.330> everybody<00:03:06.780> could<00:03:06.960> afford<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
item and not everybody could afford to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.500 
item and not everybody could afford to
have<00:03:07.830> one<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.360> an<00:03:09.360> axe<00:03:09.600> was<00:03:09.870> was<00:03:10.530> much<00:03:10.800> cheaper

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
have one and an axe was was much cheaper

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.900 
have one and an axe was was much cheaper
easier<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.750> obtain<00:03:13.160> that's<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.550> say<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
easier to obtain that's not to say that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.540 
easier to obtain that's not to say that
they<00:03:15.060> weren't<00:03:15.240> valuable<00:03:15.720> they<00:03:16.020> were<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
they weren't valuable they were and you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.300 
they weren't valuable they were and you
can<00:03:17.730> see<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.360> instance<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:19.020> axe<00:03:19.230> has<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
can see here for instance this axe has a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
can see here for instance this axe has a
wooden<00:03:20.700> wedge<00:03:20.940> inserted<00:03:21.750> into<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.320> handle<00:03:22.709> to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
wooden wedge inserted into the handle to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.030 
wooden wedge inserted into the handle to
keep<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.370> tight<00:03:23.730> within<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> socket<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.020> in<00:03:25.800> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
keep it tight within the socket and in a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.430 
keep it tight within the socket and in a
couple<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.610> other<00:03:26.790> axes<00:03:27.300> we<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:28.050> see<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
couple of the other axes we can see that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.530 
couple of the other axes we can see that
these<00:03:28.620> wedges<00:03:28.980> were<00:03:29.340> replaced<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> number

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
these wedges were replaced on a number

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.410 
these wedges were replaced on a number
of<00:03:30.570> occasions<00:03:31.640> indicating<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.270> axe

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
of occasions indicating that the axe

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420 
of occasions indicating that the axe
remained<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.110> use<00:03:34.260> over<00:03:34.680> quite<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> long<00:03:35.160> period

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
remained in use over quite a long period

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
remained in use over quite a long period
so<00:03:36.090> they<00:03:36.239> wear<00:03:36.420> valuable<00:03:36.930> objects<00:03:37.380> em<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:39.060> not

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
so they wear valuable objects em but not

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.559 
so they wear valuable objects em but not
as<00:03:39.660> valuable<00:03:40.020> as<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> sword

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
as valuable as a sword

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.629 
as valuable as a sword
you
