00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
might end up damaging the headphones but

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.350 
might end up damaging the headphones but
besides<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.280> find<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> case<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.120> very

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
besides that I find the case to be very

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
besides that I find the case to be very
comfortable<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.770> portable<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.580> it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
comfortable it's very portable and it's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.770 
comfortable it's very portable and it's
also<00:02:20.940> very<00:02:21.270> strong<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.450> throw<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
also very strong I can just throw the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.540 
also very strong I can just throw the
case<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.380> my<00:02:25.500> luggage<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.950> no<00:02:26.130> damage

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
case in with my luggage and no damage

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.110 
case in with my luggage and no damage
would<00:02:26.670> come<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:28.940> coming<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
would come to it coming to the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.570 
would come to it coming to the
headphones<00:02:30.540> themselves<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
headphones themselves I really like the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.760 
headphones themselves I really like the
design<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.540> pattern<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.110> heads<00:02:34.380> looks

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
design the pattern on the heads looks

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.680 
design the pattern on the heads looks
cool<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.730> metal<00:02:36.000> plate<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.480> top

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
cool and the metal plate on the top

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.410 
cool and the metal plate on the top
looks<00:02:37.260> pretty<00:02:37.530> cool<00:02:37.770> as<00:02:37.950> well

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
looks pretty cool as well

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.750 
looks pretty cool as well
however<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.810> headphones<00:02:40.140> themselves<00:02:40.580> feel<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
however the headphones themselves feel a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120 
however the headphones themselves feel a
little<00:02:42.090> fragile<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.990> feels<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.770> though<00:02:43.800> they

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
little fragile it feels as though they

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.360 
little fragile it feels as though they
may<00:02:44.370> break<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.240> use<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:45.840> roughly

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
may break if you use it a little roughly

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.100 
may break if you use it a little roughly
so<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> wouldn't<00:02:47.910> recommend<00:02:48.240> using<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.900> while

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so I wouldn't recommend using it while

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.650 
so I wouldn't recommend using it while
trekking<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:49.740> hiking<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.310> any<00:02:50.850> such<00:02:51.120> things

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
trekking or hiking or any such things

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.750 
trekking or hiking or any such things
they<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.380> best<00:02:52.590> suited<00:02:52.920> for<00:02:52.950> indoors<00:02:53.520> or

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they are best suited for indoors or

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.300 
they are best suited for indoors or
light<00:02:54.090> outdoor<00:02:54.750> activities<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.590> taking<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
light outdoor activities like taking a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.570 
light outdoor activities like taking a
walk<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.700> park<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:57.150> something<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.020> that

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
walk in the park or something like that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.610 
walk in the park or something like that
