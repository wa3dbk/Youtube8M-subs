because they are unique as the name
would<00:01:25.290> suggest<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.970> anti-shock

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
would suggest you do have an anti-shock

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.960 
would suggest you do have an anti-shock
mechanism<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.320> those<00:01:28.500> poles<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.700> down

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
mechanism on those poles it's not down

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 
mechanism on those poles it's not down
in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> shaft<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.520> grip

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in the shaft it's actually in the grip

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.810 
in the shaft it's actually in the grip
itself<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> give<00:01:35.430> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
itself so you can see that give it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.030 
itself so you can see that give it's
pretty<00:01:36.180> passive<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.110> springy<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.920> not

pretty passive it's not springy it's not

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
pretty passive it's not springy it's not
going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.340> bouncing<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.630> you

need it when you're really bearing down
on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.360> pole<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.590> gift

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
on the pole it will have some gift

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.370 
on the pole it will have some gift
there's<00:01:44.909> vibration<00:01:45.149> whenever<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.200> using

that<00:01:48.450> vibration<00:01:49.049> makes<00:01:49.290> its<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that vibration makes its way up the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
that vibration makes its way up the
poles<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> hit<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> last<00:01:52.079> solid

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
poles is going to hit that last solid

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.950 
poles is going to hit that last solid
piece<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.220> happens<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.420> wrists

piece which happens to be your wrists

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
piece which happens to be your wrists
this<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.649> dampen<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.729> take<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
this will dampen that so take some of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.410 
this will dampen that so take some of
the<00:01:57.360> repetitive<00:01:57.930> strain<00:01:58.579> during<00:01:59.579> long<00:02:00.060> days
