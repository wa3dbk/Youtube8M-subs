00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.180
So today we're going to be trying something
called Alfajores.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.560
And this is something you can find throughout
South America but it varies from country to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
country.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.030
So today we're having Peruvian Alfajores,
so I'm going to open the box for a big reveal.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.829
And we've ordered a few different varieties.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.320
Wow, that looks awesome.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.170
We're very used to the Argentinian ones.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.370
Yeah.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.710
So what I've found particularly fascinating
upon researching Alfajores is that it has

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
Arabic origins.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.650
Then it made its way to Spain and now it has
become immensely popular all over South America.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.930
Right, so this is the original which I'm going
to be trying first.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.420
So it is basically two layers of a crumbly
cookie.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Let's zoom in on that.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.420
It has.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.990
You can zoom in.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.990
It has Manjar Blanco in the middle which is
kind of like Dulce De Leche.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.990
It is a milk caramel.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.750
It is very sweet.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.560
And then it has like a white powdery sugar
like icing sugar on top.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.170
It looks like a very generous amount of the
dulce de leche.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.890
So this is a miniature version of the original
Alfajor And it is what I'm trying first.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.260
Bite sized.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Mmmm.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.240
Those are really nice.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.780
Up to standard?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.780
Mmmm.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.830
Nice and sugary.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.400
I think it would be nice for breakfast or
for a little snack.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.170
Heck, maybe even dinner.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.100
I could see you eating that for dinner.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.180
You like your sweets.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.400
It is really nice.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.159
Alright, I'm also going to have the original
one.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.920
And Alfajores kind of have a special place
in my heart because during our wedding one

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.080
of the things we made together as a family
with Audrey's family is a huge batch of Alfajores

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240
which we ate of course and shared to our guests.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.650
So high expectations here and it does have
some positive memories for me as well.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.090
Mmmm.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.620
One big bite.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.920
That's pretty good.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.310
Okay, so I'm interested in having this one
next because it looks like chocolate.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.080
Let's hold that up.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.790
I'll zoom in.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:40.030
Oh yeah, it's got a chocolate layer.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.780
Okay.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.880
I'm trying to figure out what the filling
is.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.370
Do you think it might be a dark fruit of some
sort kind?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.159
Maybe like a plum.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.950
Not a plum but a date.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.069
A date filling?

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.260
I think.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.849
No, it's chocolate-y.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.430
I think maybe they took the Manjar Blanco
that we had for the other one and just added

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.290
some chocolate and mixed it together.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.290
That would be my guess.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.240
And the cookie is chocolate.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.580
How does it compare to the original?

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.730
I think I prefer the original personally.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.100
But this is nice as well, it is very tasty.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.750
And mysterious.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.670
So you got a little excited about the next
one.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.349
Well, we were shooting a photo for our cover
photo image of this video and I just got a

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.349
little carried away.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.819
I was just planning on having my teeth on
it but my brain.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.340
My subconscious brain took over and basically
forced me to have a bite.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.720
Okay, first 'unofficial bite' over here.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.459
Yeah, that is really nice.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.630
It kinds of reminds me of the original Alfajor
but the big difference here is that it has

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.989
a crunchier exterior and if you see over on
this side it is covered in what appears to

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.239
be walnuts.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.319
How about the cookie dough?

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.319
Does it also have nuts?

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.319
Is it crunchy?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.400
Yeah, it is definitely crunchier than the
original one which is more like a thin cookie.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.729
Alright, and then we are down to one.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.759
The one and only lonely one.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.840
So it is my turn.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.210
I believe this one has honey.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.320
That is what I was told.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.370
It looks sticky.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.370
It looks big.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.370
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.370
Look at that.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.030
Okay, it is like a triple one.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.560
So triple layered Alfahor.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:50.560
Dude, it is spilling all over the place.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560
Let's get a really good zoom in on that.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560
Like that is just...woah.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.201
That is some serious, serious topping overflow
there.

00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.201
And the taste?

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:07.050
Well, that is not your average honey that
is for sure.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.650
It's really thick and sticky.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:17.550
I've had it in a few other Peruvian desserts
but I still don't know what it is made out

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.550
of.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.110
Yeah, it has a stronger flavor than regular
honey.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.360
Would you care to have a bite and tell me
your thoughts?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.880
Maybe you can decipher the great mystery.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.660
Alright, the things that Audrey makes me do.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.639
The things I do in front of the camera.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.639
Oh my gosh.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.639
I'm just kidding.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.260
This is awesome.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.400
First bite here.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.419
Woah, I probably should have had a smaller
bite.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.940
Yeah, that kind of reminds me of the Turron
sauce honey.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.790
I have a feeling that maybe it mixed with
some kind of date or possibly a kind of marmalade

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.480
because yeah it just doesn't have a pure honey
taste in my opinion.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.630
So we picked up this little goodie box from
La Casa Del Alfajor which translates to the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.880
house of the Alfajor.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.340
And a yeah, it was a great little goodie box
but I guess what sort of surprised me was

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.550
that I ended up liking the original the most.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.630
How about you?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.630
Same.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.630
Loved the original.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.570
So I guess the take home message for today
is don't mess with that awesome classic good

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.110
flavor.
