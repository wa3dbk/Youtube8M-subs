is is weakening itself unfortunately but
I<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> add<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> rapture<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399 
I also think if you add the rapture to
that<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> devastating

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that it's going to have a devastating
