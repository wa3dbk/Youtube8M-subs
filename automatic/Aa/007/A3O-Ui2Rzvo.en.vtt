00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.349
 embarrassing 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.469
 but you can see how I tick how that works 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.019
 with players like for example 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 it would be one 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.149

 my boys in the morning 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.509
 we must

 say loud and fairy tales 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.949

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.949
 and that's how big mirrors no longer sort 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.129

 Speyer has 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.639
 why had that eliminated youth 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.990
 that works 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.439
 so she sure 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.279
 Euro third

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.639
 what he played there 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.639
 many teens would know 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.269

 it was ensured 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.430
 not clear 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.839

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:48.949
 not from 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.949
 Everyone has to do something like that 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.080
 good question 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.080
