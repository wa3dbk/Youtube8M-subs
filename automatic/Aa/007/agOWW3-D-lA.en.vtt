00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.250
 in the next tutorial we are going to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.109
 learn to whiten nails we 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.180
 they could have been yellow or they could 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.650
 have any color other than white or the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.599
 original nails 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.500
 and the materials that we are going to use 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.360
 They are the following 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.360
 lemon juice lemon 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.940
 an empty paintbrush container we can not 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.200
 empty putting it face down during a 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.950
 day or a few hours and then filling in 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.950
 nail polish remover and letting it dry 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 the big little one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.110
 and a file or the texts that serve to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.520
 polish the nails that have four sides 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 if we do not have one of one that is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 very soft grain that will not harm us 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 the nail since we are going to use it for 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.830
 the top part of the nails does not stop 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 feed then we can not be 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.550
 scratch that only to remove the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 shine therefore a very very very lime 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 fine but what has worn us 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.860
 could come and here are material touches 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860
 what are we going to need 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.130
 The first thing we are going to do is this 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 half lemon using a juicer or 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 well squeezing it but it is true that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.760
 we squeeze will not leave less 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.590
 we will take less quantity 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.340
 then with the reasoned then it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.380
 know very 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.390
 place the funnel in 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.149
 in the cart that we have in this case 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 the container of nail polish that had been 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.020
 Said before 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.650
 and inside we're going to be the lemon juice 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.650
 what we have squeezed 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.680
 with a little bit we will have plenty 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.170
 and what we wanted what is the product 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.130
 that will allow us our nails 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 they turn white 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.890
 once we have our little bottle 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.740
 With the lime juice we will be able to take 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 the sludge very conveniently and in 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.910
 any place also since 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.040
 we do not have to let it dry either 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.240
 therefore we will not be able to use 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.950
 any quick to post the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.900
 important in the stroke on a regular basis 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.730
 well every day we shoot several 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 times until we see that antonio from the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.780
 mine, they are going to climb us 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.620
 we usually want how we can 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.750
 apply good 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.159
 for this we are going to use the blockade 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.590
 He had said 'no four faces 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.400
 polished when in some worn 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.440
 concept for his pure and soft mother 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.950
 let's say to greatly improve the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.569
 abomination to lie or stay three is 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.870
 cover the nail in this way with the each 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.989
 one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.019
 if we use a multi-sided ones 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.989
 hand we remove the shine that covers 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.620
 the nail and we stayed a bit with 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.440
 powder and matt and shiny color a 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.210
 What are we going to do next? 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.150
 pour lemon foam that we have made 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.290
 since having the home environments 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.980
 although we do them 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 I think it was a pretty chubby coat 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.310
 it was a tooth 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.810
 in this way 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.260
 and now the only thing we have to do 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.969
 is to wait for it to dry out 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.540
 natural the silver that we follow with 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.760
 nothing or if we are in a hurry I do not know I do not know if 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.239
 it's fine at all because we have a 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.609
 porous retire with a rag of a 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.620
 ham paper is what we're going to 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.689
 to get is that the nail slowly go 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.629
 getting its natural tone in all 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.310
 the changes and in yellow tone that 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.230
 we say from behind and by one 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.150
 same good good to add as 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.950
 and it was all this that you liked 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.950
 and that the same trick
