remember is anything that recedes

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.689 
remember is anything that recedes
anything<00:05:11.889> that<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.099> want<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.340> make<00:05:12.460> looks

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
anything that you want to make looks

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.480 
anything that you want to make looks
like<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.090> recedes<00:05:13.510> into<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.900> fold<00:05:14.490> it's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
like it recedes into the fold it's

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.070 
like it recedes into the fold it's
supposed<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:15.970> be<00:05:16.090> dark<00:05:16.270> anything<00:05:16.900> that's

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
supposed to be dark anything that's

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.719 
supposed to be dark anything that's
coming<00:05:17.349> out<00:05:17.650> turns<00:05:18.310> lighter

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
coming out turns lighter

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.060 
coming out turns lighter
so<00:05:19.570> now<00:05:19.660> let's<00:05:19.840> going<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.349> take<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.800> light

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
so now let's going to take the light

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.180 
so now let's going to take the light
cerulean<00:05:21.520> blue<00:05:22.289> and<00:05:25.169> go<00:05:26.169> on<00:05:26.349> top<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.889> and

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
cerulean blue and go on top of that and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.029 
cerulean blue and go on top of that and
that<00:05:27.550> makes<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.180> look<00:05:28.389> like<00:05:28.659> the<00:05:28.960> like<00:05:29.830> it's

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
that makes it look like the like it's

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.540 
that makes it look like the like it's
coming<00:05:30.460> out<00:05:30.699> really<00:05:31.659> hope<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.380> show<00:05:32.979> up<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:35.550> my

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
coming out really hope to show up but my

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.250 
coming out really hope to show up but my
camera<00:05:36.820> is<00:05:37.090> really<00:05:37.270> bad<00:05:37.599> what<00:05:37.900> I'm<00:05:38.020> gonna<00:05:38.139> try

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
camera is really bad what I'm gonna try

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.649 
camera is really bad what I'm gonna try
to<00:05:38.289> get<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.710> camera<00:05:39.070> later<00:05:39.220> but<00:05:39.550> we<00:05:40.330> see<00:05:40.539> if

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
to get to the camera later but we see if

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.430 
to get to the camera later but we see if
I<00:05:40.720> can<00:05:40.930> move<00:05:41.139> my<00:05:41.380> light<00:05:41.590> and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.450 

there<00:05:46.430> we<00:05:46.610> go<00:05:47.120> much<00:05:47.810> better<00:05:49.240> okay<00:05:50.530> so<00:05:51.530> now<00:05:51.920> I'm

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
there we go much better okay so now I'm

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.060 
there we go much better okay so now I'm
just<00:05:53.210> gonna<00:05:53.360> kind<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:53.990> continue<00:05:54.710> that<00:05:57.910> up<00:05:58.910> here

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
just gonna kind of continue that up here

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.680 
just gonna kind of continue that up here
I'm<00:06:01.070> just<00:06:01.400> basically<00:06:01.760> guiding<00:06:02.210> myself<00:06:02.510> from

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
I'm just basically guiding myself from

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.360 
I'm just basically guiding myself from
my<00:06:02.840> drawing<00:06:03.170> not<00:06:03.470> for<00:06:03.680> my<00:06:03.770> genes<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.250> then

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
my drawing not for my genes and then

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.000 
my drawing not for my genes and then
there's<00:06:04.550> my<00:06:04.670> light<00:06:04.910> source<00:06:05.710> I'm<00:06:06.710> just<00:06:06.890> going

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
there's my light source I'm just going

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.780 
there's my light source I'm just going
to<00:06:07.070> take<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.250> little<00:06:07.460> bit<00:06:07.610> of<00:06:07.730> dark<00:06:08.110> black<00:06:09.110> and

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.150 
to take a little bit of dark black and
darken<00:06:10.790> up<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:10.940> darkest<00:06:11.750> darkest<00:06:12.200> part<00:06:12.800> the

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
darken up the darkest darkest part the

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.620 
darken up the darkest darkest part the
deepest<00:06:13.750> creases<00:06:14.750> or<00:06:15.050> receding<00:06:15.800> parts<00:06:16.630> need

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
deepest creases or receding parts need

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.890 
deepest creases or receding parts need
to<00:06:17.660> be<00:06:17.900> darkened<00:06:18.620> with<00:06:18.800> black<00:06:19.280> and<00:06:19.880> then<00:06:20.840> I'm

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
to be darkened with black and then I'm

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.380 
to be darkened with black and then I'm
going<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.080> take<00:06:21.290> my<00:06:21.730> ultramarine<00:06:22.730> blue<00:06:22.760> which

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
going to take my ultramarine blue which

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.240 
going to take my ultramarine blue which
is<00:06:23.540> the<00:06:23.660> overall<00:06:23.810> color<00:06:24.410> of<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.710> jeans<00:06:24.980> in<00:06:25.220> my

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
is the overall color of the jeans in my

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.600

remember
receding<00:06:49.070> parts<00:06:49.930> of<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.200> gene<00:06:51.470> material<00:06:53.020> are

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
receding parts of the gene material are

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
receding parts of the gene material are
dark<00:06:54.440> and<00:06:55.690> parts<00:06:56.690> that<00:06:56.900> come<00:06:57.200> out<00:06:57.470> into<00:06:57.950> the

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
like what I did but I'm running out of

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.760 
like what I did but I'm running out of
time<00:07:27.710> so<00:07:27.770> bye
