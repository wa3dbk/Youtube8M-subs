00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:42.319 
going to put our thread up over there

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.379 
going to put our thread up over there
like<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.339> comes<00:00:43.519> off<00:00:43.729> the<00:00:43.909> comb<00:00:44.149> this

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:44.389 
like that so it comes off the comb this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.319 
like that so it comes off the comb this
way<00:00:44.629> now<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:45.620> thread<00:00:46.159> it<00:00:46.190> through<00:00:46.519> this<00:00:46.789> little

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
way now we thread it through this little

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.360 
way now we thread it through this little
eye<00:00:47.539> right<00:00:47.870> here<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.289> little<00:00:48.440> white<00:00:48.739> eye<00:00:48.979> and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
eye right here the little white eye and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.759 
eye right here the little white eye and
we<00:00:49.549> thread<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.879> from<00:00:50.179> the<00:00:50.329> front<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.559> back

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
we thread it from the front to the back

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.099 
we thread it from the front to the back
so<00:00:52.699> we're<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.089> come<00:00:53.389> through<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.809> right

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
so we're going to come through it right

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.399 
so we're going to come through it right
here<00:00:55.329> like<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.359> from<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.019> front<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.379> the

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
here like that from the front to the

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.899 
here like that from the front to the
back<00:00:57.499> now<00:00:58.370> we're<00:00:58.579> going<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.760> go

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
back now we're going to go

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.379 
back now we're going to go
counterclockwise<00:01:00.429> so<00:01:01.429> we're<00:01:01.639> going<00:01:01.819> to<00:01:01.999> go<00:01:02.149> in

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
counterclockwise so we're going to go in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.020 
counterclockwise so we're going to go in
on<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:03.260> side<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.889> this<00:01:04.159> first<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> left

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
on this side of this first on the left

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.730 
on this side of this first on the left
side<00:01:05.269> around<00:01:05.930> here<00:01:06.470> like<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.870> then<00:01:08.870> over

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
side around here like this and then over

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.630 
side around here like this and then over
here<00:01:11.410> let<00:01:12.410> me<00:01:12.560> make<00:01:12.770> sure<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:13.100> stays<00:01:13.430> in

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
here let me make sure that stays in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.750 
here let me make sure that stays in
there<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:14.540> that<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.110> then<00:01:15.800> give<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.610> a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
there like that and then give it a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.230 
there like that and then give it a
little<00:01:16.910> tug<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.570> will<00:01:17.720> go<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.380> between

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
little tug so it will go in between

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.940 
little tug so it will go in between
those<00:01:20.240> two<00:01:20.690> steel<00:01:21.140> disks

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
those two steel disks

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.360 
those two steel disks
okay<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.150> went<00:01:23.390> front<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:25.010> around

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
okay so that went front and then around

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.120 
okay so that went front and then around
counterclockwise<00:01:25.940> over<00:01:26.510> here<00:01:27.260> now<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.710> put

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
counterclockwise over here now just put

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.950 
counterclockwise over here now just put
your<00:01:28.160> bobbin<00:01:28.520> on<00:01:29.050> like<00:01:30.050> that<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.180> then<00:01:32.180> thread

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
your bobbin on like that and then thread

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.390 
your bobbin on like that and then thread
your<00:01:33.350> thread<00:01:33.710> through<00:01:33.740> one<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.280> those<00:01:34.520> holes

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
your thread through one of those holes

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.970 
your thread through one of those holes
push<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.670> over<00:01:38.020> hold<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.230> to<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.590> thread

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
push that over hold on to that thread

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.620 
push that over hold on to that thread
and<00:01:40.220> I'm<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.490> going<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.700> use<00:01:40.850> my<00:01:40.880> hand<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.480> do

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and I'm just going to use my hand to do

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.380 
and I'm just going to use my hand to do
this<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.110> normally<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:42.860> would<00:01:43.160> be<00:01:43.730> stepping<00:01:44.030> on

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
this but normally I would be stepping on

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.600 
this but normally I would be stepping on
it<00:01:44.450> with<00:01:44.810> my<00:01:45.020> foot<00:01:45.230> much<00:01:45.470> much<00:01:45.710> easier<00:01:45.740> I'm

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
it with my foot much much easier I'm

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.270 
it with my foot much much easier I'm
just<00:01:46.940> going<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.120> very<00:01:47.920> carefully<00:01:48.920> give<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.220> a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
just going to very carefully give it a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040 
just going to very carefully give it a
few<00:01:49.460> starts<00:01:49.940> did<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.300> see<00:01:50.450> how<00:01:50.540> easy<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.900> was

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
few starts did you see how easy that was

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.070 
few starts did you see how easy that was
it<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:51.470> broke<00:01:51.710> off<00:01:51.980> right<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.080> by

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
it just broke off right there and by

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320 
it just broke off right there and by
doing<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.740> way<00:01:55.040> when<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.820> run<00:01:56.090> out<00:01:56.300> of

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
doing it this way when you run out of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.110 
doing it this way when you run out of
thread<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:57.170> your<00:01:57.260> machine<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:58.730> runs<00:01:58.940> out

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
thread on your machine it just runs out
