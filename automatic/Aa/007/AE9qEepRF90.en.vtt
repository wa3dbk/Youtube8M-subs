00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.189
 answer vinÃ­cius lacerda's question 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.960
 it asks if symphony 5 is it 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.210
 better than the appliances that are 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 measured in the same price range and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.219
 depends on many things is not the good of the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.950
 that teachers negative books there 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.960
 ozhan fone 51 it has a more design 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.399
 interesting than that of motogp by 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.010
 motorola example 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.960
 only he has a camera that is inferior 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.390
 considerably lower than that of the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.989
 640 which is also sold in the range of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.550
 five hundred six hundred reais in one 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.600
 bone through the motorola also offer 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.600
 other things like digital tv 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.420
 Incidentally, digital TV is also in the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.519
 nuno lunet 146 the number is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.700
 exactly a friday when you also tv 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.829
 is digital and so in terms of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.680
 performance they are similar only 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.079
 iphone uses a dual intel processor 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.020
 core while the other two end up 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.049
 using the dragon I passed an arm that is more 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.759
 common but as one can cut yes it is 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.950
 The most importa has got is that it is more 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.859
 common in android is more accepted 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.109
 programs so year we found 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:36.969
 no problem with x86 tuning 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:41.240
 beyond the processor x86 android 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.420
 iphone more so the most popular alarm 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.340
 and yes and in terms of battery life 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.200
 the three are paulo the same thing a 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.840
 average of six hours in the test 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.279
 of intense use of infolab which ends up 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.430
 reflecting on a day of moderate use 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:58.210
 exactly what you are not 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.640
 It will be the night load and you're going to get some 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 10 11 o'clock at night you wake up 18 already 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.860
 it was a taboo battery needs a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.900
 Charger close by then get one 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.190
 portable charger that is practical 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.300
 you carry in your pocket or in your backpack 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.980
 rising 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 So these are people if you have more 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.640
 doubt leave it here for people that we 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.940
