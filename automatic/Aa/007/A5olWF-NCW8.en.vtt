00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
ends of the large tail feathers lay in a

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.890 
ends of the large tail feathers lay in a
row<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:48.700> you'll<00:00:48.940> see<00:00:49.150> with<00:00:49.300> my<00:00:49.480> knife<00:00:49.690> is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
row as you'll see with my knife is

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.470 
row as you'll see with my knife is
pointing<00:00:50.970> and<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.150> just<00:00:52.590> cut<00:00:53.590> down<00:00:54.090> each<00:00:55.090> side

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
pointing and I just cut down each side

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.700 
pointing and I just cut down each side
to<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.500> middle<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.810> then<00:00:58.960> break<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.530> and

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
to the middle and then break that and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.920 
to the middle and then break that and
join<00:00:59.860> it<00:01:00.070> over<00:01:00.400> you'll<00:01:00.730> see<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.570> very

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
join it over you'll see that that very

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.540 
join it over you'll see that that very
last<00:01:02.110> joint<00:01:02.590> will<00:01:02.770> lay<00:01:02.950> against<00:01:03.670> there<00:01:05.550> then

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
last joint will lay against there then

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.219 
last joint will lay against there then
I'll<00:01:06.670> turn<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.090> fan<00:01:07.330> over<00:01:09.750> pull<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.900> flesh

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
I'll turn the fan over pull that flesh

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.830 
I'll turn the fan over pull that flesh
down<00:01:11.560> like<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:11.979> see<00:01:12.190> if<00:01:12.280> they're<00:01:12.840> making

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
down like you see if they're making

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.370 
down like you see if they're making
another<00:01:14.110> horizontal<00:01:14.830> cut<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.690> cut<00:01:17.110> clear

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
another horizontal cut now to cut clear

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.010 
another horizontal cut now to cut clear
down<00:01:17.530> through<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.010> skin<00:01:18.340> but<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.960> to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
down through the skin but to going to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.380 
down through the skin but to going to
cut<00:01:20.229> down<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.590> where<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.830> meat<00:01:21.040> stops<00:01:21.400> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
cut down to where the meat stops and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.180 
cut down to where the meat stops and
then<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.740> game<00:01:23.950> you're<00:01:24.130> just<00:01:24.340> shaving<00:01:26.190> the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
then the game you're just shaving the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
meat the flesh from the ends in those

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.609 
meat the flesh from the ends in those
quills<00:01:33.240> now<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.300> don't<00:01:34.630> have<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.990> get<00:01:35.140> all<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
quills now you don't have to get all the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.690 
quills now you don't have to get all the
flesh<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.640> if<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.900> curing<00:01:38.170> will<00:01:38.619> do<00:01:39.520> much

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
flesh but if you're curing will do much

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.620 
flesh but if you're curing will do much
better<00:01:40.060> if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.450> get<00:01:44.280> once<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:45.429> have<00:01:45.670> that

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
better if you get once you have that

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.410 
better if you get once you have that
meat<00:01:46.869> shaved<00:01:47.200> away<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.610> take<00:01:48.850> your<00:01:49.030> knife<00:01:49.210> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.459 

once<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.039> have<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:59.000> little<00:01:59.450> flash<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.289> moon

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
once you have it a little flash the moon

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.529 
once you have it a little flash the moon
there<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.280> particular<00:02:01.579> fan<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.270> has<00:02:02.509> a

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
there this particular fan here has a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.499 
there this particular fan here has a
little<00:02:02.840> flash<00:02:03.079> up<00:02:03.289> on<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.560> back<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:04.880> you

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
little flash up on the back you can you

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.209 
little flash up on the back you can you
really<00:02:05.750> don't<00:02:05.960> have<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.469> know<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.100> will

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
really don't have to know if it it will

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.960 
really don't have to know if it it will
peel<00:02:07.399> off<00:02:07.610> there<00:02:07.850> just<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:09.819> once<00:02:10.819> you

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
peel off there just like that once you

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.820 
peel off there just like that once you
get<00:02:11.150> more<00:02:11.390> axon<00:02:11.900> even<00:02:12.440> though<00:02:12.530> there's<00:02:12.769> a

get more axon even though there's a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.040 
get more axon even though there's a
little<00:02:13.099> meat<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.450> going<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.750> cure<00:02:15.019> it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
little meat on it it's going to cure it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.059 
little meat on it it's going to cure it
anyway<00:02:19.569> pick<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.690> borax<00:02:21.049> real<00:02:21.349> liberally<00:02:21.799> and
