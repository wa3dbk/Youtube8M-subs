to nine tons so all those who the t-rex

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.550 
to nine tons so all those who the t-rex
definitely<00:02:09.819> was<00:02:10.090> longer<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.720> taller<00:02:10.959> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that's how big a t-rex for long time we

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
that's how big a t-rex for long time we
believe<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.269> t-rex<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.140> largest

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
believe the t-rex was the largest

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.729 
believe the t-rex was the largest
coniferous<00:02:21.040> dinosaur<00:02:21.849> ever<00:02:22.150> then<00:02:22.989> we

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
coniferous dinosaur ever then we

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.399 
coniferous dinosaur ever then we
discovered<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> Giga<00:02:24.819> notice<00:02:25.269> Oris<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
discovered the Giga notice Oris and a

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.670 
discovered the Giga notice Oris and a
Spinosaurus<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.430> both<00:02:28.120> were<00:02:28.720> even<00:02:29.260> bigger

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
Spinosaurus and both were even bigger

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.040 
Spinosaurus and both were even bigger
than<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.280> t-rex

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130 

so<00:02:36.050> how<00:02:36.620> would<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.890> do<00:02:36.950> leave<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.970> comment<00:02:38.480> let<00:02:39.110> me
