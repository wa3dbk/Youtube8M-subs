00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
and the wind is all gone don't know how

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.510 
and the wind is all gone don't know how
the<00:01:40.700> hell'd<00:01:40.910> them<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.330> be<00:01:41.420> honest<00:01:41.630> okay

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
the hell'd them down to be honest okay

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.930 
the hell'd them down to be honest okay
and<00:01:44.410> now<00:01:45.410> we<00:01:45.470> need<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.710> wait<00:01:45.920> until<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.729> first

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and now we need to wait until the first

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.719 
and now we need to wait until the first
ball<00:01:47.180> comes<00:01:47.450> up<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.369> just

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
ball comes up like so and then you just

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.650 
ball comes up like so and then you just
lift<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.150> up<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.759> then<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.270> jump<00:01:53.570> on

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
lift this up and then you just jump on

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.840 
lift this up and then you just jump on
it<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:53.900> there<00:01:54.530> wait<00:01:54.830> for<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.160> second<00:01:55.430> bar<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it and there wait for the second bar to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.440 
it and there wait for the second bar to
a<00:01:55.880> point<00:01:56.810> lift<00:01:57.440> up<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:58.700> should<00:01:58.940> just<00:01:59.090> lift

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
a point lift up and it should just lift

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.800 
a point lift up and it should just lift
you<00:01:59.539> up<00:01:59.570> like<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.240> then<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> double

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
you up like so and then you do a double

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.700 
you up like so and then you do a double
jump<00:02:03.670> from<00:02:04.670> there<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> beam<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.440> that's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
jump from there to the beam and that's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.729 
jump from there to the beam and that's
it<00:02:06.890> basically<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:08.090> hardest<00:02:08.300> part<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.619> now

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
it basically is the hardest part and now

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.640 
it basically is the hardest part and now
it's<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.009> shimmying<00:02:10.429> across<00:02:10.610> Thunder<00:02:11.330> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's just shimmying across Thunder and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:47.980 
it's just shimmying across Thunder and
just<00:02:12.650> loot<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> tomb<00:02:13.520> so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.270 

so<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.020> hope<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.290> enjoyed<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.590> hope<00:02:50.130> this
