00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
taller and it's a little wider so you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.360 
taller and it's a little wider so you

next up is one that i saw at gamestop
and<00:04:32.199> i<00:04:32.680> thought<00:04:33.460> i<00:04:33.610> should<00:04:33.639> get<00:04:33.970> into<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and i thought i should get into the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.080 
and i thought i should get into the
series<00:04:34.509> before<00:04:34.960> i<00:04:35.169> played<00:04:35.409> the<00:04:35.530> fourth<00:04:35.770> one

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
series before i played the fourth one

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.760

seeing<00:04:37.090> as<00:04:37.210> I've<00:04:37.360> already<00:04:37.569> played<00:04:38.319> the<00:04:38.530> first

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770

seeing as I've already played the first
one<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.919> thought<00:04:39.159> I<00:04:39.190> could<00:04:39.400> get<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> second<00:04:40.000> one

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
one I thought I could get the second one

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.210 
one I thought I could get the second one
beat<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.050> then<00:04:41.139> get<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.379> third<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:41.949> I

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
beat that and then get the third so I

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.189 
beat that and then get the third so I
