00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 welcome to lesson number 8 of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 guitar for beginners guitar 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 basic for those who are starting 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.590
 from scratch now let's make a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.389
 small practice in what it is 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.119
 synchronization between the right hand and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.390
 the left hand one of the most 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.430
 important at the beginning of starting 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 to play the guitar is to know how to synchronize 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.680
 the two hands while the right hand 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.380
 moves to change the left hand 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.570
 so that 's one of the few 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 the important things but now we are going to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.980
 do roll with the rhythm of ballad that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 we had practiced previously as 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.500
 you already know the rhythm of ballad is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.500
 four movements 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.920
 two 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.910
 then the rhythm begins with the thumb 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.090
 23 and ends with the index above then 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.930
 it really starts 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 ends 23 when 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.170
 what we are going to practice now between 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.560
 my youngest 17 yo younger 17 we had already 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.220
 practiced the chords my minor 17 we go 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 to do two times or rather said 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.040
 let's make two circles it would be a two 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.040
 three four 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 one would be twice once four times 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.860
 times once 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 once four times twice 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.530
 then let's go twice in my 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.190
 minor 123 when a one two three 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.360
 when two now we change seven 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 then we start again with the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.970
 thumb 223 when and now again 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 friends we're just going to do this exercise 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:07.260
 between 17 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 and then 2 3 by 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.970
 none 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 two 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:21.080
 rossi 73 42 now what are we going to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.260
 try is to change without stopping the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.450
 beginning as he had said and that happens I 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 I would say one hundred percent 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.630
 of my students who started from 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.570
 zero they could not synchronize 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.670
 Including me is not difficult is not 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.040
 easy to synchronize at the beginning is very 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.820
 complicated that's why what I'm going to insist 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.390
 in this part we are going to do now 200 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.390
 compasses 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:03:02.180
 12 27 23 42 and without paying two thousand dollars 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.440
 when 234 now I'm going to I'm not going to stop 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 me so you do not get confused 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:26.019
 when 24 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.010
 now so that when you get tired 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.690
 of these two chords when you already do 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.600
 feel a little bored 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.160
 let's pray to change to greater sun we're going 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.160
 to preach the hour of the greater sun 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.640
 those who do not know their latest and greatest 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 come back in the video to part number 6 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.100
 let's see now himself 12 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:17.970
 34 17 34 27 then when 1 2 3 and 1 2 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:17.970
 3 4 points 3 and 3 2 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.989
 two 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.530
 23 23 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.960
 two 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.990
 with time when there are no celebrities to give 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.710
 a lot of time for you to be that they put what 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:57.390
 complicated the change of the sun late 7 to 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:05:00.350
 start is complicated 23 22 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.350
 ah 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.460
 very well that they can practice all 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.290
 the days all the time if they do not have 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.980
 a lot of time to practice like that be 10 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.870
 minutes or 20 or 15 but every day is 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.390
 Best practice 15 minutes every 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.380
 days than two hours once a week or 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.150
 once a month 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.510
 remember because this course is 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.120
 progressive let's go in parts by 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.720
 parts for you to go 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.790
 developing little by little the way 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.950
 master the guitar because this course is 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.560
 practically for those who want to play 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.180
 seriously the guitar that's why 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.260
 I'm giving from the beginning so that 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.180
 you go step by step and go 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.400
 progressively go forward this go 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.400
 advancing little by little little by little 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.010
 to raise advancing level and little to 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.590
 little you are going to develop and 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.220
 they are going to advance in what is the 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.070
 guitar 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.090
 now let's go to a change that is 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:10.690
 of less than retail and my 7 mi 7 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:16.770
 then we will do when a 2 3 4 1 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.770
 2 3 and 2 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:41.730
 237 234 thousand 72 points 37 22 32 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:07:00.310
 when the 342 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:18.849
 the two more with 4.30 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:26.990
 together after timid times for the 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:33.589
 distilled 342 more timid east coast to 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:40.289
 23 4 points after shy points 

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:44.059
 at 34 23 timid 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.059
 is dressed
