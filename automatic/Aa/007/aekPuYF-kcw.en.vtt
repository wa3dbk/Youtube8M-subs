go up but between here and here it's
just<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.789> engine<00:00:50.969> cause<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.680> start

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
just like the engine cause like I start

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
just like the engine cause like I start
shaking<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> whole<00:00:54.360> pie<00:00:54.510> starts

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
shaking so I don't know exactly what

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.229 
shaking so I don't know exactly what
could<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:58.949> be

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 

everything<00:01:24.270> seems<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.630> fine<00:01:24.930> except<00:01:25.290> for

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the you know it into the engine to mix

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.420 
the you know it into the engine to mix
it<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.360> oil<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:21.620> know

I<00:02:24.569> understand<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.989> not<00:02:26.319> gonna<00:02:26.500> be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I understand so it not gonna be

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.789 
I understand so it not gonna be
completely<00:02:27.280> level<00:02:27.549> but<00:02:27.879> you're<00:02:28.000> always<00:02:28.799> level

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
completely level but you're always level

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.039 
completely level but you're always level
it's<00:02:30.400> actually<00:02:30.849> just<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.209> little<00:02:31.239> bit<00:02:32.099> higher

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
it's actually just a little bit higher

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.240 
it's actually just a little bit higher
about<00:02:35.049> right<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:36.069> there<00:02:36.719> and<00:02:37.719> I<00:02:38.709> don't<00:02:39.099> know

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
about right right there and I don't know

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.819 
about right right there and I don't know
people<00:02:39.579> who<00:02:39.670> keep<00:02:39.819> telling<00:02:40.030> me<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.829> because

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
people who keep telling me that because

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.429 
people who keep telling me that because
I<00:02:41.859> put<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.909> running<00:02:43.750> more<00:02:43.989> air

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
I put that on it is running more air

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:51.020 
I put that on it is running more air
into<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.719> the<00:02:47.139> mix<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.769> gas<00:02:48.129> is<00:02:48.689> not

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
into it so the mix of gas is not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.629 
into it so the mix of gas is not
combined<00:02:52.030> with<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.319> air<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:57.370> they

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
combined with the with the air so they

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.289 
combined with the with the air so they
keep<00:02:57.790> telling<00:02:57.939> me<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.299> get<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.510> piece<00:02:59.200> III

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
keep telling me to get a piece III

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.640 
keep telling me to get a piece III
