firewall<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.290> block<00:02:52.530> programs

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
firewall that you can block programs

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.640 
firewall that you can block programs
with<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> firewall<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.209> blocked<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.260> Aspire

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
with the firewall I blocked the Aspire

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.820 
with the firewall I blocked the Aspire
announcer<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:57.239> know<00:02:57.620> some<00:02:58.620> other

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
announcer and you know some other

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.920 
announcer and you know some other
programs<00:02:59.250> up<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.540> can't<00:03:00.750> block

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
programs up here you can you can't block

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.130 
programs up here you can you can't block
almost<00:03:01.170> anything<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.890> want<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.280> block<00:03:03.140> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
almost anything you want to block you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780 
almost anything you want to block you
can<00:03:04.320> block<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.530> from<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> Internet

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
can block it from going to the Internet

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390 
can block it from going to the Internet
so<00:03:06.170> when<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.350> blocked<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.860> know<00:03:08.010> from<00:03:08.250> going

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
so when it's blocked you know from going

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.240 
so when it's blocked you know from going
to<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> Internet<00:03:09.320> then<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.470> Internet<00:03:10.920> cannot

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to the Internet then the Internet cannot

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.140 
to the Internet then the Internet cannot
send<00:03:11.489> whatever<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:14.340> banners<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.030> so

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
send whatever to it like banners and so

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.640 
send whatever to it like banners and so
this<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.600> way<00:03:15.720> how<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.900> block<00:03:16.260> banners

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
