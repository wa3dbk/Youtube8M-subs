00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.010
 Y 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.419
 Y 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 Y 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.730
 the left hand we are also going to 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 place over the position of an octave 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 below 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.250
 twice 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.250
 then the sun 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.940
 two 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.940
 let's remember that only 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.330
 if we put both hands together we see that the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 first sentence wants us like that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.840
 Y 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.189
 in the second sentence 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.140
 let's move the right hand of the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.740
 position of the we were going to go up the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.170
 thumb finger 1 to min 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.170
 and the melody does the following 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.500
 where are we going to change the place 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.500
 then we go to the tournament 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.150
 it's important we'll see changes in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.350
 positions that will make the hand 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.350
 right we start in the me 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 and the left hand is pretty 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.740
 then a few Fridays in the sun 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.319
 then we climb to the lower 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.050
 then we change something bigger 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.090
 later afa major 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.110
 good 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.470
 do not 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.470
 the least 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.879
 Y 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990
 no no 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 let's see how are you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.709
 all right 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.709
 i 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.239
 Y 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.200
 um 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.850
 and we have the assurance 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.580
 the third and last sentence we had 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.260
 stayed at the end of the second with this 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.560
 king with the four and from here we go to 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.560
 start 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.920
 i 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.980
 and then we go down to this chord 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.810
 and then to finish going 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.440
 and we start 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.989
 or 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.910
 then we go down to file 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.910
 and then we go down something bigger 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.630
 left well let's start the fa 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.440
 higher 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.440
 good 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.940
 later when older 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.890
 slowly 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.670
 and then ends with the right hand 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.580
 if we aim it 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.300
 we stayed at the beginning of the agreement 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.129
 the law 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.639
 higher 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.639
 i 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.230
 higher 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.230
 the phrase on the left 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.229
 of the 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.229
 higher 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.510
 and now we only have to play the three 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.510
 phrases followed 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.590
 Y 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.060
 i
