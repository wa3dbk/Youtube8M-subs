00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 If you see a sad friend, what would you say? 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 and if a friend asks you for help to make 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.450
 Peace with another of your friends 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 how would it help him and these are just two 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 examples of situations that presents a 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 video game in which they simulate 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 social relationships and that psychologists 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 Emotional education experts use 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 to develop social skills 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
 with the little ones because a child that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 he does not know how to handle his sadness he does not know 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 handle fear can not approve a 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 examination despite knowing about all the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 Mathematics content a child 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.980
 who does not know how to work as a team and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.050
 understands well why the other one gets 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.489
 sad or angry is not going to be able 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.320
 relate and will not be able to work in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.850
 team of a future in a job in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 this type of game you can create the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 avatars of known people these 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.489
 avatars have their own personality and they 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.590
 relate to each other generating 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.969
 situations that children 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.910
 they can bump into real life 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.070
 playing can see how it should be 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.070
 act before those situations in your life 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.170
 a month in chicha 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.509
 I needed a glass of water offered a 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
 sausage and over you have made a friend 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.189
 the dynamics is good so for 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.720
 be able to work with children and encourage 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.670
 in them then both the skills 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.250
 social as they learn to know each other 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.020
 also through this game also 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 allows us to learn to take 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.549
 decisions and well then a little the idea 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.289
 is to encourage friends all the part of 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.000
 emotional intelligence through 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.740
 games and activities like this we can 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.319
 teach them to empathize with acquaintances 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.300
 and family to make decisions with a little 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.979
 more time than in real life to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.979
 react appropriately to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.259
 conflicts in the end under a tutelage 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.940
 appropriate video games based on 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.100
 social relationships can be a great 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.709
 tool in development and education 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 of our children that's what to me 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.330
 like more than you can participate with others 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.009
 children of the console and enjoy that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.009
 game without without isolation
