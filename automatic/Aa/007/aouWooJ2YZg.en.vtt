thing I want to talk about it is the
streaks<00:02:02.569> and<00:02:02.840> call<00:02:03.379> of<00:02:03.470> duty<00:02:03.709> ghosts<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.160> think

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
streaks and call of duty ghosts I think

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.430 
streaks and call of duty ghosts I think
that<00:02:04.580> black<00:02:05.239> ops<00:02:05.479> they're<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.750> little<00:02:06.050> bit<00:02:06.289> too

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
that black ops they're a little bit too

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.440 
that black ops they're a little bit too
strong<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:06.979> mw3<00:02:07.489> there<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.819> little<00:02:08.090> bit<00:02:08.270> too

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
strong in mw3 there a little bit too

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.839 
strong in mw3 there a little bit too
weak<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.259> want<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.770> see<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.670> like

weak so I want to see just kind of like

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.390 
weak so I want to see just kind of like
a<00:02:10.879> combination<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:11.690> both<00:02:11.870> um<00:02:12.349> one<00:02:13.069> thing<00:02:13.099> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
a combination of both um one thing that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.979 
a combination of both um one thing that
was<00:02:13.489> really<00:02:13.610> bad<00:02:13.819> about<00:02:14.030> mw3<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.720> all<00:02:14.840> your

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
was really bad about mw3 is all your

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.110 
was really bad about mw3 is all your
shrieks<00:02:15.290> got<00:02:15.500> shot<00:02:15.770> down<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.310> they<00:02:16.819> also<00:02:16.940> took

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
shrieks got shot down and they also took

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.850 
shrieks got shot down and they also took
forever<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.720> call<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.140> which<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.440> really<00:02:18.620> hated

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
forever to call in which I really hated

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.680 
forever to call in which I really hated
but<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.700> black<00:02:19.849> ops<00:02:20.060> who<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.270> think<00:02:20.390> they<00:02:20.569> were

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
but in black ops who I think they were

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.540 
but in black ops who I think they were
just<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:21.260> bit<00:02:21.500> too<00:02:21.650> strong<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.430> I

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
just a little bit too strong like I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.800 
just a little bit too strong like I
don't<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:22.849> kill<00:02:23.060> shrieks<00:02:23.330> should<00:02:23.540> get<00:02:23.690> you

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
don't think kill shrieks should get you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.800 
don't think kill shrieks should get you
upwards<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.349> 20<00:02:24.650> kills<00:02:24.890> oh<00:02:25.390> definitely<00:02:26.390> like

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
upwards of 20 kills oh definitely like

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.330 
upwards of 20 kills oh definitely like
the<00:02:26.840> dogs<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.410> swarm<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.769> black<00:02:27.980> ops<00:02:28.190> 2

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the dogs and the swarm in black ops 2

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.400 
the dogs and the swarm in black ops 2
were<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.879> good<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> things<00:02:30.110> i<00:02:30.230> think

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
were so good one of the things i think

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.170 
were so good one of the things i think
that<00:02:30.530> black<00:02:30.769> ops<00:02:30.980> 2<00:02:31.129> definitely<00:02:31.580> did<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
that black ops 2 definitely did right is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.720 
that black ops 2 definitely did right is
that<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.750> dogs<00:02:33.050> even<00:02:33.740> if<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.950> had<00:02:34.160> blind<00:02:34.520> eye

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that the dogs even if you had blind eye

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.220 
that the dogs even if you had blind eye
on<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.090> guys<00:02:35.240> i<00:02:35.420> would<00:02:35.600> try<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.930> know<00:02:35.960> sit

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
on the guys i would try to you know sit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.540 
on the guys i would try to you know sit
in<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.380> building<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:36.770> blonde<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> dogs

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
in the building with blonde I the dogs

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.920 
in the building with blonde I the dogs
were<00:02:37.790> still<00:02:38.030> able<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.390> detect

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
were still able to detect

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.780 
were still able to detect
so<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.409> sort<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> hope<00:02:40.189> there's<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.459> killstreak

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so I sort of hope there's a killstreak

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.300 
so I sort of hope there's a killstreak
like<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.599> in<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> call<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.859> he<00:02:42.950> ghosts

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
like that in in a call that he ghosts

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.520 
like that in in a call that he ghosts
but<00:02:43.730> also<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.450> know<00:02:44.540> kind<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.810> alongside<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
but also you know kind of alongside the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.860 
but also you know kind of alongside the
topic<00:02:45.859> of<00:02:45.980> killstreaks<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.849> Moab<00:02:47.239> I'm<00:02:47.510> really

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
topic of killstreaks the Moab I'm really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.179 
topic of killstreaks the Moab I'm really
hoping<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.200> Moab<00:02:48.439> comes<00:02:48.680> back<00:02:48.920> because

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
hoping the Moab comes back because

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.800 
hoping the Moab comes back because
that's<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.849> of<00:02:49.939> the<00:02:50.030> main<00:02:50.209> things<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.629> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that's one of the main things that you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.410 
that's one of the main things that you
use<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.230> judge<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> game<00:02:51.950> playing<00:02:52.250> mw3<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.120> think

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
use to judge a game playing mw3 I think

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.970 
use to judge a game playing mw3 I think
it's<00:02:53.540> one<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.170> main<00:02:54.319> things<00:02:54.349> that<00:02:54.650> kept

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it's one of the main things that kept

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.129 
it's one of the main things that kept
the<00:02:55.099> game<00:02:55.310> alive<00:02:55.609> I'm<00:02:56.569> really<00:02:56.900> looking

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
the game alive I'm really looking

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.229 
the game alive I'm really looking
forward<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.500> seeing<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.889> coming<00:02:58.250> back<00:02:58.430> yeah

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
forward to seeing that coming back yeah

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.660 
forward to seeing that coming back yeah
I<00:02:59.269> feel<00:02:59.659> like<00:02:59.810> um<00:03:00.139> black<00:03:00.950> ops<00:03:01.189> who<00:03:01.340> really

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
I feel like um black ops who really

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.160 
I feel like um black ops who really
screwed<00:03:01.969> up<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.359> whole<00:03:02.480> nuclear<00:03:02.689> thing

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
screwed up with the whole nuclear thing

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 
screwed up with the whole nuclear thing
I<00:03:03.349> feel<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.069> their<00:03:04.280> attempt<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.819> make

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
I feel like it was their attempt to make

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.440 
I feel like it was their attempt to make
a<00:03:05.209> nuke<00:03:05.719> ish<00:03:06.409> thing<00:03:06.859> but<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:08.030> showed<00:03:08.299> up

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
a nuke ish thing but it just showed up

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.059 
a nuke ish thing but it just showed up
on<00:03:08.599> your<00:03:08.719> screen<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.349> with<00:03:09.530> all<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.769> metals

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
on your screen and with all the metals

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.199 
on your screen and with all the metals
you<00:03:10.189> didn't<00:03:10.400> even<00:03:10.489> know<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.760> got<00:03:11.030> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
you didn't even know you got it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.659 
you didn't even know you got it
sometimes<00:03:11.689> and<00:03:11.989> nobody<00:03:12.859> else<00:03:13.099> even<00:03:13.220> knew<00:03:13.489> you

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
sometimes and nobody else even knew you

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.250 
sometimes and nobody else even knew you
got<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.480> thought<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.079> was<00:03:15.139> pretty

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
got it so I thought it was pretty

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.440 
got it so I thought it was pretty
pointless<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.159> yeah<00:03:16.819> definitely<00:03:16.970> like

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
pointless but yeah definitely like

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.699 
pointless but yeah definitely like
literally<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.930> first<00:03:18.079> time<00:03:18.319> I<00:03:18.349> ever<00:03:18.470> got<00:03:18.680> a

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
literally the first time I ever got a

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.229 
literally the first time I ever got a
nuclear<00:03:19.099> I<00:03:19.280> didn't<00:03:19.489> even<00:03:19.579> realize<00:03:19.879> because

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
nuclear I didn't even realize because

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.520 
nuclear I didn't even realize because
you<00:03:20.510> know<00:03:20.599> whenever<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.930> get<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.109> kill<00:03:21.349> one<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
you know whenever you get a kill one of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.470 
you know whenever you get a kill one of
those<00:03:21.680> metals<00:03:22.040> pops<00:03:22.280> up<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:22.819> you<00:03:23.239> know<00:03:23.329> I'm

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
those metals pops up so you know I'm

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.300 
those metals pops up so you know I'm

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.649 
game-ending I hope you know it's kind of
like<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.739> back<00:03:30.919> in<00:03:31.129> mw3<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.209> guess<00:03:32.510> we'll

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
like it was back in mw3 so I guess we'll

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.750 
like it was back in mw3 so I guess we'll
see<00:03:32.840> Tamil<00:03:33.230> only<00:03:33.469> tell<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.310> one<00:03:34.459> thing<00:03:34.639> I'm

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
really looking forward to is infinity

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.470 
really looking forward to is infinity
ward<00:03:36.950> hit<00:03:37.219> detection<00:03:37.370> again<00:03:37.939> because<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.419> know

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
detection never seems to be quite as

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.270 
detection never seems to be quite as
good<00:03:41.689> as<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.319> Infinity<00:03:42.799> Ward<00:03:43.010> games

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
good as the Infinity Ward games

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.069 
good as the Infinity Ward games
especially<00:03:43.519> now<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:43.970> theater<00:03:44.479> is<00:03:44.629> gone<00:03:44.870> as

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
especially now that theater is gone as

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.099 
especially now that theater is gone as
well<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:46.010> theater<00:03:46.519> back<00:03:46.879> back<00:03:47.540> in<00:03:47.690> mw2

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
well I think theater back back in mw2

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.439 
well I think theater back back in mw2
mw2<00:03:48.919> didn't<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.430> theatre<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.030> hit

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
mw2 didn't have theatre and the hit

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.059 
mw2 didn't have theatre and the hit
detection<00:03:50.569> in<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.109> game<00:03:51.290> was<00:03:51.409> perfect<00:03:51.919> so<00:03:52.040> I

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
detection in that game was perfect so I

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.800 
detection in that game was perfect so I
think<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.790> know<00:03:52.879> I'd<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.359> see<00:03:53.510> some<00:03:53.690> good

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
like black ops 2 really screwed up I

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.589 
like black ops 2 really screwed up I
feel<00:03:58.069> like<00:03:58.159> you<00:03:58.280> can<00:03:58.459> put<00:03:58.639> ten<00:03:58.939> bullets<00:03:59.120> into<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
feel like you can put ten bullets into a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.179 
feel like you can put ten bullets into a
guy<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.079> then<00:04:00.169> he'll<00:04:00.379> turn<00:04:00.530> around<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:00.979> just

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
guy and then he'll turn around to just

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.580 
guy and then he'll turn around to just
shoot<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.549> at<00:04:01.699> you<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.209> can<00:04:02.389> die

detection like I liked how mw3 had
really<00:04:14.870> powerful<00:04:15.379> guns<00:04:15.650> like<00:04:15.889> if<00:04:16.009> you<00:04:16.099> ran

May<00:04:59.280> or<00:04:59.340> something<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.390> that's<00:05:00.570> not<00:05:00.780> even

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
May or something so that's not even

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.450 
May or something so that's not even
halfway<00:05:01.260> through<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.620> game's<00:05:01.800> life<00:05:02.040> cycle

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
halfway through the game's life cycle

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.750 
halfway through the game's life cycle
and<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:03.360> already<00:05:03.630> felt<00:05:04.050> like<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.320> was<00:05:04.440> dead<00:05:04.760> so

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
and it already felt like it was dead so

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.430 
and it already felt like it was dead so
I<00:05:05.790> really<00:05:06.240> hope<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.510> people<00:05:06.690> stay<00:05:06.990> solo<00:05:07.260> at

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.770 
I really hope that people stay solo at
the<00:05:07.560> start<00:05:07.830> because<00:05:08.040> if<00:05:08.670> one<00:05:08.940> person<00:05:09.300> decides

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
