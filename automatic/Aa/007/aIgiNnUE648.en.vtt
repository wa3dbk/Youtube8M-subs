00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 This war ... 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.440
 we are not winning it. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.940
 If you report a single word of what I am going to show you 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.440
 you will be executed for high treason 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.534
 It's beautiful ... 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.500
 It is the best encryption device in history 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.140
 and the Germans use it for all communications 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.620
 Everyone thinks that Enigma is unreadable 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.500
 Let me try it and we'll know for sure. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.060
 Mr.Turing, do you know how many died because of Enigma? 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.360
 No I do not know 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.740
 Three, while we had this conversation. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.780
 Gentlemen, I present to you Mr.Turing 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 We worked together then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000
 I'm afraid it would only slow down my work 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.300
 Popular at school, isn't it? 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.280
 We are short of staff ... 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.540
 Let's take other people then 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.537
 You have six minutes to finish the task. 

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:53.457
 It's almost impossible! 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.520
 No, I need eight. 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.229
 Five minutes, and thirty-four seconds! 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.471
 You said to do it in less than six minutes ... 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.160
 What are we really doing? 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 We will decipher an indecipherable Nazi code 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.940
 and we will win the war. 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.980
 To support this routine as an irascible genius 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.600
 one must be seriously a genius ... 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580
 I'm creating a machine that will allow us to decrypt every message, 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.580
 every day, instantly 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.940
 We will need all the help we can get 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.580
 and they won't help you if you don't like them. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 Have you decrypted a German message? 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 You'll never understand the importance of what I'm creating here! 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 Our patience is over! 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.960
 If you fire Alan then you'll have to fire me too 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.227
 me too 

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:40.727
 and me 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.920
 Will be better! 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 Alan, you won't have to do it alone! 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.460
 What's this? What happen? 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 The Navy believes that one of us is a Soviet spy! 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.160
 You have more secrets than the best of them ... 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.460
 What if she doesn't care about me that way? 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.760
 You can't tell anyone, it's illegal! 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 I'm just a mathematician ... 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.740
 Sometimes they are the people nobody imagines anything about 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.800
 to do things that no one could imagine.
