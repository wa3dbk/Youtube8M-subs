the Coleman quad lantern I've actually
had<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.460> model<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.270> for<00:00:24.810> over<00:00:25.079> a<00:00:25.140> year

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
had this one model here for over a year

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.249 
had this one model here for over a year
now<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.919> I'm<00:00:26.310> fully<00:00:26.759> confident<00:00:27.329> and<00:00:27.539> in

telling you about how awesome this thing

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.829 
telling you about how awesome this thing
is<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:31.949> starting<00:00:32.400> off<00:00:32.550> each<00:00:33.030> panel<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
is now starting off each panel the

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:35.360 
is now starting off each panel the
reason<00:00:34.050> why<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.290> called<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.739> quad<00:00:34.980> lantern

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
reason why it's called a quad lantern

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
reason why it's called a quad lantern
comes<00:00:35.879> off<00:00:36.059> breaks<00:00:36.330> off<00:00:36.510> into<00:00:36.750> four<00:00:36.780> portions

there<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.990> takes<00:01:28.350> 8<00:01:28.650> D<00:01:29.280> batteries<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:30.300> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
there and it takes 8 D batteries so it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.540 
there and it takes 8 D batteries so it
takes<00:01:30.900> takes<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> lot<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> D<00:01:31.800> batteries<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
takes takes a lot of D batteries but it

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.940 
takes takes a lot of D batteries but it
lasts<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> long<00:01:33.120> time<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.870> getting<00:01:34.230> into<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
