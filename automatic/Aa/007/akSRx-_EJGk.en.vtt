I

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.269 

we've<00:00:19.029> arrived<00:00:19.300> in<00:00:19.420> Argentina<00:00:19.840> and<00:00:20.279> pretty

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
we've arrived in Argentina and pretty

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.560 
we've arrived in Argentina and pretty
excited<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.610> go<00:00:21.670> on<00:00:21.699> this<00:00:21.789> hike<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.240> get<00:00:22.359> out<00:00:22.480> of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
excited to go on this hike to get out of

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.749 
excited to go on this hike to get out of
town<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.080> sea<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.410> landscape<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:24.070> we're

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
town to the sea the landscape and we're

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.999 
town to the sea the landscape and we're
here<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.150> look<00:00:25.300> at<00:00:25.509> this<00:00:25.689> glacial<00:00:26.470> landscape

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
here to look at this glacial landscape

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.439 
here to look at this glacial landscape
that's<00:00:27.220> very<00:00:27.490> different<00:00:27.759> than<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.210> one<00:00:28.300> will

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
that's very different than the one will

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.420 
that's very different than the one will
see<00:00:28.630> an<00:00:28.869> end<00:00:29.020> argument<00:00:29.500> it's<00:00:30.099> a<00:00:30.130> different

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
see an end argument it's a different

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.939 
see an end argument it's a different
climate<00:00:30.610> logical<00:00:31.090> zone<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.960> much<00:00:32.140> warmer<00:00:32.559> more

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
climate logical zone so much warmer more

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.869 
climate logical zone so much warmer more
wet<00:00:33.670> moisture<00:00:34.089> rather<00:00:34.330> than<00:00:34.420> slowly<00:00:34.809> moisture

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
wet moisture rather than slowly moisture

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.280 
wet moisture rather than slowly moisture
but<00:00:36.879> still<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> big<00:00:37.390> impact<00:00:37.690> device<00:00:38.019> on<00:00:38.230> the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
but still a big impact device on the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.960 
but still a big impact device on the
landscape<00:00:38.710> behind<00:00:38.920> me<00:00:39.640> there's<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.879> big

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
landscape behind me there's a big

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.200 
landscape behind me there's a big
u-shaped<00:00:40.330> valley<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:41.710> was<00:00:41.769> carved<00:00:42.250> by<00:00:42.460> past

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
u-shaped valley that was carved by past

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.569 
u-shaped valley that was carved by past
glacial<00:00:43.629> action<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.379> we'll<00:00:44.890> see<00:00:45.070> scars<00:00:45.430> on

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
glacial action and we'll see scars on

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.979 
glacial action and we'll see scars on
the<00:00:45.640> landscape<00:00:45.820> we'll<00:00:46.239> see<00:00:46.420> sediments

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
the landscape we'll see sediments

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.810 
the landscape we'll see sediments
deposited<00:00:47.050> by<00:00:47.680> ice<00:00:47.890> we'll<00:00:48.489> see<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> lot<00:00:48.760> of

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
deposited by ice we'll see a lot of

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.540 
deposited by ice we'll see a lot of
effects<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:49.989> will<00:00:50.860> be<00:00:50.980> buried<00:00:51.340> under

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
effects that that will be buried under

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.130 
effects that that will be buried under
the<00:00:51.670> ice<00:00:51.789> in<00:00:52.000> Antarctica<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:52.809> it's<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:52.960> great

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
the ice in Antarctica so it's a great

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.349 
the ice in Antarctica so it's a great
place<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.530> see<00:00:53.969> landscape<00:00:54.969> with<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.239> ice

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
place to see landscape with the ice

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.569 
place to see landscape with the ice
removed<00:00:55.750> from<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.500> impact<00:00:56.859> more

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
removed from it and the impact more

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:07.680 
removed from it and the impact more
obvious

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.690 

today<00:01:08.690> it's<00:01:08.900> been<00:01:09.050> amazing<00:01:09.550> there's<00:01:10.550> been

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
today it's been amazing there's been

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.190 
today it's been amazing there's been
some<00:01:10.850> really<00:01:10.970> great<00:01:11.210> using<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.780> mountains

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
some really great using the mountains

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.530 
some really great using the mountains
I'm<00:01:12.740> all<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.010> valleys<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.760> we've<00:01:14.390> had<00:01:14.510> a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
I'm all the valleys and we've had a

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.170 
I'm all the valleys and we've had a
couple<00:01:14.660> rivers<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.260> we<00:01:15.380> passed<00:01:15.560> um<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:17.090> I've

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
couple rivers that we passed um and I've

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.300

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.030 
just been just been so pretty in a lot
of<00:01:19.400> mud<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:20.960> been<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.530> lot<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.680> fun<00:01:21.860> though

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
of mud but it's been a lot of fun though

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.060 
of mud but it's been a lot of fun though
the<00:01:22.640> mud<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.960> does<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.440> your<00:01:24.620> boots<00:01:24.770> caught
