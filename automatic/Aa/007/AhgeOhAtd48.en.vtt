hi-yah our customers are indeed well
today<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> piston<00:00:14.490> sitting<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.030> on

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
today we have a piston sitting here on

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.890 
today we have a piston sitting here on
our<00:00:15.330> mill<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.220> we've<00:00:17.220> chosen<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.940> piston<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
our mill and we've chosen this piston to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
our mill and we've chosen this piston to
go<00:00:19.770> into<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.600> Chevrolet<00:00:22.279> 292<00:00:23.279> block<00:00:23.580> which<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
go into a Chevrolet 292 block which is a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470 
go into a Chevrolet 292 block which is a
inline<00:00:24.750> six<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.400> was<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> truck<00:00:26.910> motor<00:00:27.180> not

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
inline six and it was a truck motor not

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
inline six and it was a truck motor not
found<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.960> passenger<00:00:28.529> cars<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.010> this

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
found in passenger cars and this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.310 
found in passenger cars and this
particular<00:00:30.179> engine<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> be

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
particular engine we're going to be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040 
particular engine we're going to be
building<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> land<00:00:32.189> speed<00:00:32.550> car<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.840> we

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
building up for a land speed car and we

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.920 
building up for a land speed car and we
have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> modify<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> piston<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.719> as<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
have to modify the piston a bit as you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
have to modify the piston a bit as you
can<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.290> we've<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.770> hypereutectic<00:00:38.700> piston

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can see we've got a hypereutectic piston

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.380 
can see we've got a hypereutectic piston
here<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> coded<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> reduce<00:00:41.370> our

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.760 

compression<00:00:45.390> distance<00:00:45.960> which<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
compression distance which is from the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
compression distance which is from the
center<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> pin<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.289> piston

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
center of the pin to the top of piston

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
center of the pin to the top of piston
here<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.219> 100<00:00:50.730> thousands<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here by about 100 thousands I'm going to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
here by about 100 thousands I'm going to
show<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.890> done<00:00:55.940> well<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:56.969> might

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
show you how that's done well you might

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630 
show you how that's done well you might
be<00:00:57.270> asking<00:00:57.600> yourself<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.649> pull<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
be asking yourself how do we pull this

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.110 
be asking yourself how do we pull this
piston<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.690> our<00:01:00.870> table<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:02.120> can't

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
piston to our table here because can't

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.740 
piston to our table here because can't
hold<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> sides<00:01:04.549> well<00:01:05.549> I've

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
hold on to it from the sides well I've

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.410 
hold on to it from the sides well I've
made<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.080> fixture<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> use<00:01:08.040> on

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
made up a little fixture that I use on

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
made up a little fixture that I use on
doing<00:01:09.420> jobs<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.250> once<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.430> goes<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
doing jobs like this once I goes in the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.240 
doing jobs like this once I goes in the
other<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> bolt<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:16.040> see<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
other and you bolt this down see if we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.289 
other and you bolt this down see if we
can<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> work<00:01:18.030> here

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.819 

now<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.990> course<00:01:26.170> there's<00:01:26.439> always<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
now of course there's always the

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.410 
now of course there's always the
question<00:01:26.860> about<00:01:27.430> well<00:01:27.640> gee<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.030> know<00:01:28.090> can't

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
question about well gee you know can't

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.730 
question about well gee you know can't
you<00:01:28.509> tighten<00:01:28.869> one<00:01:28.930> side<00:01:29.229> more<00:01:29.409> than<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.619> other

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
you tighten one side more than the other

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.350 
you tighten one side more than the other
and<00:01:29.860> it'll<00:01:30.009> bring<00:01:30.189> this<00:01:30.369> side<00:01:30.610> down<00:01:30.820> or<00:01:31.149> bring

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
and it'll bring this side down or bring

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840 
and it'll bring this side down or bring
the<00:01:31.540> other<00:01:31.630> side<00:01:31.930> down<00:01:32.170> whichever<00:01:32.850> yeah

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the other side down whichever yeah

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
the other side down whichever yeah
that's<00:01:34.149> that's<00:01:34.540> true<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.110> we<00:01:35.409> have<00:01:35.439> to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's that's true and we have to

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.219 
that's that's true and we have to
actually<00:01:36.130> align<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.610> piston<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.840> our<00:01:37.960> cutter

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
actually align the piston to our cutter

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
actually align the piston to our cutter
here

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.359 

and<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.950> bring<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and what we want to do is bring this

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:56.289 
and what we want to do is bring this
over<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:51.829> or<00:01:52.829> cutter<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.700> it's

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:04.530 

inaudible<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.600> piston

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.830 

let's<00:02:05.540> pretty<00:02:05.840> good<00:02:05.930> there<00:02:06.170> now<00:02:07.539> go<00:02:08.539> ahead<00:02:08.630> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
let's pretty good there now go ahead and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.620 
let's pretty good there now go ahead and
snug<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.319> down<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> little<00:02:09.770> bit<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:17.360> we'll

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
snug this down a little bit then we'll

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.050 
snug this down a little bit then we'll
turn<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.959> on<00:02:18.280> well<00:02:19.280> actually<00:02:19.400> see<00:02:19.880> which

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
turn this on well actually see which

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.420 
turn this on well actually see which
side<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> cut<00:02:20.989> from<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.470> then<00:02:22.250> we'll

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
side is going to cut from and then we'll

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.370 
side is going to cut from and then we'll
squeeze<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.000> thing<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:23.540> down<00:02:23.690> depending

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
squeeze this thing up or down depending

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:44.060 
squeeze this thing up or down depending
on<00:02:24.709> which<00:02:24.920> way<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.370> going

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.690 

that's<00:02:45.070> pretty<00:02:45.250> good<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:45.460> there

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that's pretty good right there

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.790 
that's pretty good right there
all<00:02:48.180> right<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.750> go<00:02:48.900> ahead<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.260> make<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> few

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
all right so we go ahead and make a few

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:05.200 
all right so we go ahead and make a few
thousand

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:28.530 

several<00:03:06.210> steps

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.000 

maybe<00:03:29.540> asking<00:03:29.959> yourself<00:03:30.379> with<00:03:30.530> jiff<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.829> takes

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
maybe asking yourself with jiff it takes

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.530 
maybe asking yourself with jiff it takes
hundred<00:03:31.280> thousands<00:03:31.640> office<00:03:31.969> and<00:03:32.120> pissing<00:03:32.480> on

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
hundred thousands office and pissing on

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.869 
hundred thousands office and pissing on
be<00:03:32.719> too<00:03:32.900> thin<00:03:33.170> not<00:03:34.099> really<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:34.609> this

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
be too thin not really because this

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.970 
be too thin not really because this
things<00:03:35.120> about<00:03:35.329> 350<00:03:36.140> thousands<00:03:36.590> crown

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
things about 350 thousands crown

00:03:36.980 --> 00:05:05.050
