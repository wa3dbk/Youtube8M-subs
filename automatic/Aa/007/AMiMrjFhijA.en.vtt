it<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.560> way<00:00:19.770> over<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> over<00:00:20.610> you<00:00:21.330> keep<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it one way over and over you keep the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.439 
it one way over and over you keep the
cost<00:00:21.840> down<00:00:22.369> now<00:00:23.369> even<00:00:24.089> though<00:00:24.269> you're

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
cost down now even though you're

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
cost down now even though you're
building<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.869> boat<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.199> less<00:00:25.380> expense<00:00:25.859> that

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
building a boat for less expense that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.040 
building a boat for less expense that
doesn't<00:00:26.640> mean<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> use<00:00:27.150> cheap<00:00:27.689> parts

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
doesn't mean you have to use cheap parts

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
doesn't mean you have to use cheap parts
and<00:00:28.169> pieces<00:00:28.289> regularly<00:00:28.710> absolutely<00:00:29.669> one<00:00:30.210> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
compartment in the deck we can learn a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.590 
compartment in the deck we can learn a
lot<00:01:06.660> about<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.410> boat<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> built<00:01:08.510> when<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lot about how the boat is built when we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.970 
lot about how the boat is built when we
take<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> hatch<00:01:10.050> off<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.440> first<00:01:10.680> thing<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
take the hatch off the first thing we

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.920 
take the hatch off the first thing we
notice<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.880> hinged<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
notice is it's not hinged now that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.300 
notice is it's not hinged now that
steves<00:01:13.170> won't<00:01:13.380> cost<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> makes<00:01:14.160> it<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
steves won't cost but it makes it a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.500 
steves won't cost but it makes it a
little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> hassle<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.090> deal<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
little bit of a hassle to deal with that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.390 
little bit of a hassle to deal with that
hatch<00:01:15.690> once<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.680> inside<00:01:17.010> you're<00:01:17.280> going

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
hatch once you get inside you're going

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.950 
hatch once you get inside you're going
to<00:01:17.460> notice<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> compartment<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.780> not

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to notice that the compartment is not

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.370 
to notice that the compartment is not
lined<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.119> might<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.510> look<00:01:21.690> as<00:01:21.840> nice<00:01:22.080> but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
lined now it might not look as nice but

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
lined now it might not look as nice but
on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.010> upside<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.670> gain<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.510> inches

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
on the upside you gain about two inches

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
on the upside you gain about two inches
of<00:01:24.960> depth<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> compartment<00:01:25.800> by<00:01:26.070> not

of depth in this compartment by not
lining<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.850> by<00:01:27.840> making<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.350> gunnels<00:01:28.770> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
lining it by making these gunnels so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
lining it by making these gunnels so
narrow<00:01:29.280> Bayliner<00:01:29.880> did<00:01:30.240> gain<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:30.720> space

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
narrow Bayliner did gain a lot of space

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
narrow Bayliner did gain a lot of space
in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> boat<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.100> lose<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> ability<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in the boat but you lose the ability to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
in the boat but you lose the ability to
put<00:01:33.270> stowage<00:01:33.600> compartments<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.260> there<00:01:34.470> now

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
put stowage compartments in there now

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.650 
put stowage compartments in there now
they<00:01:35.520> made<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.119> putting<00:01:36.540> these

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
they made up for it by putting these

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.050 
they made up for it by putting these
nifty<00:01:37.259> Nets<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> still<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.910> plenty

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
nifty Nets here so you still have plenty
