a higher temperature than the other and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.340 
a higher temperature than the other and
this<00:01:04.070> requires<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.760> use<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.140> asymmetric<00:01:06.140> rear

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
this requires the use of asymmetric rear

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.850 
this requires the use of asymmetric rear
tires<00:01:07.900> excess<00:01:08.900> temperature<00:01:09.170> can<00:01:09.650> have<00:01:09.829> a

tires excess temperature can have a
negative<00:01:10.100> effect<00:01:10.729> on<00:01:10.909> performance<00:01:11.119> and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
negative effect on performance and

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.830 
negative effect on performance and
durability<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:13.070> asymmetric<00:01:13.880> rear<00:01:14.119> tires<00:01:14.479> use

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
durability so asymmetric rear tires use

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840 
durability so asymmetric rear tires use
a<00:01:14.869> combination<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.799> harder<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.400> softer

use<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.359> tires<00:02:02.630> within<00:02:03.109> their<00:02:03.289> optimum

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
use the tires within their optimum

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.830 
use the tires within their optimum
temperature<00:02:04.009> range<00:02:04.609> so<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.539> they<00:02:05.659> can

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
temperature range so that they can

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680 
temperature range so that they can
deliver<00:02:06.079> peak<00:02:06.500> grip<00:02:06.829> and<00:02:07.039> durability<00:02:07.690> leading

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
deliver peak grip and durability leading

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.739 
deliver peak grip and durability leading
to<00:02:08.869> better<00:02:09.049> lap<00:02:09.410> times
