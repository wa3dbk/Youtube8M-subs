and out of my backpack I could pop
another<00:02:17.519> half<00:02:17.819> cube<00:02:18.180> right<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.379> let's

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
another half cube right here with let's

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.530 
another half cube right here with let's
say<00:02:19.890> pants<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.579> shorts<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.180> then<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.360> would

have<00:02:21.780> maybe<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.650> would<00:02:22.860> purchase<00:02:23.040> 1/4<00:02:23.670> cube

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
have maybe a I would purchase 1/4 cube

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.089 
have maybe a I would purchase 1/4 cube
or<00:02:24.090> something<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> throw<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> here<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.439> socks

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
other items so for one last comparison

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.110 
other items so for one last comparison
why<00:02:35.879> don't<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.239> see<00:02:36.689> what<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.739> volume<00:02:38.549> clothes

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
why don't I see what this volume clothes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.780 
why don't I see what this volume clothes
looks<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.980> unzipped<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.340> expanded

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
looks like unzipped and expanded

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.699 
looks like unzipped and expanded
unzipped<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.939> expanded<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:47.750> don't<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:49.349> I

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
unzipped and expanded I don't think I

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.089 
unzipped and expanded I don't think I
could<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.310> another<00:02:51.019> half<00:02:52.019> cube<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:52.920> like

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
could put another half cube in here like

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.129 
could put another half cube in here like
I<00:02:53.159> thought<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.639> could<00:02:54.060> with<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.659> compressed

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
I thought I could with the compressed

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.259 
I thought I could with the compressed
version<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:56.010> cube<00:02:56.370> took<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.970> little<00:02:57.060> bit

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
version the cube took up a little bit

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.080 
version the cube took up a little bit
more<00:02:57.450> space<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.680> means<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.189> can't<00:02:59.579> put

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
more space that means that I can't put

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.179 
more space that means that I can't put
the<00:03:00.780> half<00:03:00.959> cube<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.590> thought<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.829> was<00:03:02.040> going

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
the half cube like I thought I was going

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.860 
the half cube like I thought I was going
to<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:02.819> fine<00:03:03.090> though<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.540> weights<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
to so that's fine though the weights the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.809 
to so that's fine though the weights the
same<00:03:03.989> maybe<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.010> wouldn't<00:03:05.220> want<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.489> carry

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
same maybe you wouldn't want to carry

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.729 
same maybe you wouldn't want to carry
anything<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.780> anyways<00:03:07.139> just<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
anything more anyways just because of

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.379 
anything more anyways just because of
the<00:03:07.829> weight<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.280> few<00:03:08.579> t-shirts<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.150> isn't

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
the weight a few t-shirts you know isn't

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.410 
the weight a few t-shirts you know isn't
too<00:03:09.510> heavy<00:03:09.659> but<00:03:10.019> if<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.680> did<00:03:11.159> want<00:03:11.459> more<00:03:11.819> space

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
too heavy but if you did want more space

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.270 
too heavy but if you did want more space
go<00:03:13.109> with<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.319> compression<00:03:13.650> cube<00:03:14.040> because

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
go with the compression cube because

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.039 
go with the compression cube because
even<00:03:14.579> though<00:03:14.639> I<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:14.760> everything<00:03:15.269> nicely<00:03:15.510> in

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
even though I have everything nicely in

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.710 
even though I have everything nicely in
here<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.129> small<00:03:17.519> amount<00:03:17.879> of<00:03:17.970> space<00:03:18.150> is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
here just that small amount of space is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.470 
here just that small amount of space is
going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.470> take<00:03:19.739> one<00:03:20.129> more<00:03:20.160> half<00:03:20.879> cube<00:03:21.239> out<00:03:21.449> of

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
going to take one more half cube out of

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.259 
going to take one more half cube out of
my<00:03:22.260> bag<00:03:22.620> they<00:03:23.280> are<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> little<00:03:23.669> bit<00:03:23.819> pricier

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
my bag they are a little bit pricier

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.689 
my bag they are a little bit pricier
than<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> non<00:03:25.079> compression<00:03:25.829> set<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.549> if

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
than the non compression set but if

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.309 
than the non compression set but if
you're<00:03:26.879> spending<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.299> money<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.720> get<00:03:27.840> packing

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
you're spending the money to get packing

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.520 
you're spending the money to get packing
cubes<00:03:28.650> anyways<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:29.849> from<00:03:30.659> seeing<00:03:31.019> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
cubes anyways just from seeing the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.189 
cubes anyways just from seeing the
difference<00:03:32.010> between<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.849> non<00:03:33.480> compressed

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
difference between the non compressed

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.409 
difference between the non compressed
versus<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.799> compressed<00:03:35.220> version<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.909> would

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
versus the compressed version I would

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.149 
versus the compressed version I would
definitely<00:03:36.840> spend<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.290> extra<00:03:37.409> money<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:38.040> get

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
definitely spend the extra money to get

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.189 
definitely spend the extra money to get
this<00:03:38.370> thanks<00:03:38.819> for<00:03:38.879> watching<00:03:39.269> see<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.169> next

time<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:43.979> use<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.340> as<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.639> club

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
time you can use this as like a club

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.900 
time you can use this as like a club
