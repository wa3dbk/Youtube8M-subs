everybody up in this fourth ninja war so

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.220 
everybody up in this fourth ninja war so
okay<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
okay that that was the that was the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.760 
okay that that was the that was the
opening<00:02:01.980> um<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:03.210> was<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.750> fast<00:02:04.020> paced<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
opening um it was really fast paced and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
opening um it was really fast paced and
I<00:02:05.340> thought<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.730> animation<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:06.660> good

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
I thought the animation was pretty good

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.710 
I thought the animation was pretty good
especially<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:09.090> kaga<00:02:09.510> are

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
especially when the go kaga are

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.620 
especially when the go kaga are
attacking<00:02:10.260> my<00:02:10.440> data<00:02:11.180> there's<00:02:12.180> something<00:02:12.540> like

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
attacking my data there's something like

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.140 
attacking my data there's something like
this<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:12.960> cool<00:02:13.260> close<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:14.000> music<00:02:15.000> ah

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
this really cool close up of music ah

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
this really cool close up of music ah
Gaede<00:02:16.280> she<00:02:17.280> was<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.870> pretty<00:02:19.080> intense

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Gaede she was it that was pretty intense

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.300 
Gaede she was it that was pretty intense
um<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> yeah<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.600> guess<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.990> covered<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.650> all

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
more wacky animation that reminds me of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.120 
more wacky animation that reminds me of
not<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.090> past<00:04:42.650> opening<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.950> one

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
not that this past opening but the one

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.830 
not that this past opening but the one
before<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.820> where<00:04:45.060> everyone<00:04:45.360> was<00:04:45.510> just<00:04:45.750> like

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
before that where everyone was just like

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.040 
before that where everyone was just like
leaping<00:04:46.230> around<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:48.060> ended<00:04:48.570> with<00:04:48.840> like

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
leaping around and it ended with like

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.720 
leaping around and it ended with like
everybody's<00:04:49.560> standing<00:04:49.920> on<00:04:50.010> top<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.490> rock

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
everybody's standing on top of a rock

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.850 
everybody's standing on top of a rock
and<00:04:51.120> till<00:04:51.510> we're<00:04:51.630> be<00:04:51.750> falling<00:04:52.200> down<00:04:52.350> just

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
and till we're be falling down just

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.850 
and till we're be falling down just
really<00:04:53.550> goofy<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.360> any<00:04:55.050> time<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.320> see<00:04:55.650> these

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
really goofy and any time I see these

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.770 
really goofy and any time I see these
kind<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.250> openings<00:04:56.730> or<00:04:56.910> endings<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.420> think<00:04:57.630> it's

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
kind of openings or endings I think it's

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.710 
kind of openings or endings I think it's
like<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.200> animations<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.980> use<00:04:59.130> way<00:04:59.490> to<00:05:00.420> kind

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
like the animations to use way to kind

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.660 
like the animations to use way to kind
of<00:05:01.310> lighten<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.550> mood<00:05:03.650> after<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:05.220> serious

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
of lighten the mood after the serious

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.610 
of lighten the mood after the serious
content<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:07.230> actual<00:05:08.120> episode<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:10.140> I<00:05:10.500> think

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
content of the actual episode so I think

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.710 
content of the actual episode so I think
that's<00:05:11.190> kind<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.550> how<00:05:11.670> they<00:05:11.880> sandwich<00:05:12.480> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
that's kind of how they sandwich the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.740 
that's kind of how they sandwich the
episode<00:05:13.230> is<00:05:13.500> they'll<00:05:13.680> have<00:05:13.830> like<00:05:14.040> a<00:05:14.100> dark

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
episode is they'll have like a dark

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.630 
episode is they'll have like a dark
opening<00:05:15.750> or<00:05:15.870> ending<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.950> light<00:05:17.190> funny

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
opening or ending and a light funny

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.680 
opening or ending and a light funny
weird<00:05:18.240> opening<00:05:18.960> your<00:05:19.110> ending
