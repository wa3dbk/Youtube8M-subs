00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.990
 let's grow shikaku less in this election 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.110
 and here we are going to see what characteristics each of the 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.950
 first we're going to see were the first numbers that we're going to 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.829
 start 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:12.560
 it's called natural numbers 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.620
 we call it natural because they are two numbers with which naturally 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.289
 we count 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.730
 everything but are 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.869
 like these 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.869
 about 2 3 4 and then these three little dots 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:24.739
 means 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.130
 who deserved it to infinity 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.569
 notice that all these numbers 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.140
 whole parties just do not have papers and hands to the desman of these 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.560
 numbers are going to be 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.329
 the two bonds that we have 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.100
 one two three four five six and to infinity 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.310
 they are called natural then this is our first classification of 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.940
 numbers 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 Beijing Oct 11 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.050
 Well this is our first classification 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380
 when we add the zero 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.670
 to those numbers we call it natural increased then the goal at zero 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.260
 and we want now the natives 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.030
 and if we add the breast 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.709
 then we are talking about the natural increases 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.690
 after drought we have another classification 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900
 then in this other classification 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.980
 natural post is increased include also the 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.440
 natural 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.590
 and then I dropped another - classification are 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.360
 numbers like the natural ones but these are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.380
 also negative to these we call them whole firefighters 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.090
 these whole numbers are like these 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.130
 Well that's the same as the natural ones but they are also negative 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 they do not have part of cimalsa either, it's part of their mother here it's back to zero 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 Well, we already have another classification team 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
 after here what I think we have is that the natives 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.040
 they are part natural ones increased natural ones are also part 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040
 of the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.570
 all these 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 they are part of the higher classification they are called 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 rational 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 quito - ap 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.460
 after this rational 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.530
 are two numbers that can be written as 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 as a faction as a ratio of 2 integers 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.140
 I will explain here that they are the reason are the reasons 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.300
 when we have 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.969
 two-thirds 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.529
 one of the workers 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.499
 also one reason could be two points 8 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.359
 over 9 points 4 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.939
 It is also a reason 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.779
 but when that ratio is a ratio of 2 integers 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.629
 then we are talking about the rational numbers festa this does not tell me 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.829
 could remove because nothing more of the explanation that was a reason 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.559
 these rational numbers are 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.259
 notice that all these 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.039
 whole the one on top learned of work lost to two-thirds 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.919
 12 finds out three in three 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:46.469
 and minus seven the two are integers 5 on 11 the cars or numbers 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.939
 whole 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.929
 all these are rational 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.150
 and all these 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.530
 include those that we have said before get here we have to 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.959
 all the numbers these 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 the rational 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.169
 they include the integers 2 integers to the natural ones increased but in others 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.879
 still mentioned to the natives and then fell after wounding it meters 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.729
 what can not be expressed as a ratio of 2 integers 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.359
 this we call ourselves 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.849
 and rational 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.629
 here I will put them 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.279
 all these irrational 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.099
 are like this maybe the most famous seasonal number is this number 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.749
 pi 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:27.329
 because we have not found two whole numbers one over another that is not expressed 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.729
 what is the exact value of quincoces 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.609
 three points 1 4 1 5 9 2 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.759
 and then follow the three points means yes and yes and yes still not 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:37.579
 we find 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.579
 two integers that do not express that pin number 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.029
 we also have these numbers 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.939
 as part of the seasonal the root of two 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.459
 in negative king of five the negative 27 root of three 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.409
 all these artists and companies but this is a classification 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.869
 apart then 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.639
 we were doing 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.859
 these do not belong to the rational 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.379
 especially if they are from the international but all these together 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.919
 they do something they call 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.219
 the real numbers 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.609
 that's why I know I'm going to believe that these are all these 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.889
 the faith numbers 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.609
 then of the real numbers we have of the types 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.150
 rational in relation to the cycle and to the rational entire sections 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.520
 the non-rational attacks as such 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.610
 one its precipitation are the integers and the natural ones has increased if it succeeds 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.490
 overthrow 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.240
 and then there he had numbers that are called 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.499
 imaginary after a separate classification 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.710
 what are the imaginary numbers are basically 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.360
 estate 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.520
 of negative numbers 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.120
 those are two imaginary numbers 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.029
 these are two that we wrote to you 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.759
 with the letter and for example we have 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.870
 root of -9 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.870
 it is 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.669
 because the root of 9 we all wanted as well as 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.669
 - one 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.039
 by nine 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.249
 and we take it away from new roots it rises like the root 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.360
 we would be 3 because the root of -1 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.809
 what is equal 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:18.740
 but if you do not need it for now then jumper namasco they are imaginary 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.849
 and these a classification 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.669
 totally apart 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:23.800
 this month 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.550
 a separate classification 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.800
 and all these all these 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.150
 we are talking about 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
 the universe of moments we could say that all these 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.180
 efe here 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
 I'm just from the universe of 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.139
 I know we can not 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.520
 then the numbers we have basically two imaginary types 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.379
 imaginary or real 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.419
 and the real ones we have rational and irrational in relation to the integers 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.909
 increased patterns 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.139
 and natural 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.499
 if this part 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:58.990
 it does not work for now 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.779
 totally ignoring 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.099
 because these for courses a little 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.449
 more advanced mathematics especially in high school hugo m 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.409
 pre collegiate or I do not know how that already fulfilled in stansted I hope this are 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.179
 a little more advanced what interests us let's say in sixth seventh 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:16.129
 eighth 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.050
 are this part of the real numbers 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.020
 well then 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.860
 I hope it serves you see you in the next passiflora
