00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.370
 Today I am going to teach you 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.050
 the world came to effect because at the same time everything more than anything is like a 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.789
 information apeti information 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.279
 d as a counter 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.900
 uu your textile hotelier 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.210
 even with kike lópez I think as header 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 so they are on all your devices that are numbered 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.160
 now we are going to give you can not teach how everything I told mine 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.950
 Well, that's how James is connected. 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 two computers a television 3 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 this is a country that are two 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.500
 now this cable 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.870
 this video of riders telling them once is for those who do not know do not have 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 an idea how to do it 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.430
 what am I going to see there 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.530
 We knew what that was from me since it was totally different 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.750
 no one knows what 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 so that those who do not know it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 the spectators a remarkable urban reserve 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.810
 Red and white 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.910
 then in your account and have 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.710
 with having an entry 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 usually dijin 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 this one says or because output 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 thing that this optical output and output resides now 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.410
 reconcile or whatever you want to call 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 after his departure to all his people who will have another equal 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 another one equal white and red but you are going to say ing wazir gestures entries that is 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.510
 the same 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.850
 you hear that noise 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.920
 it's because I just exposed him so much we have a TV 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 He was held by Senator Jon Kyl 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.990
 Now that's the same as it is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.170
 As I told you, you have to have some membranes with your terra id 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.969
 and they put it 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.969
 just like that, nothing else is a single cable 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 now but it can also be a test 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.509
 jefferson 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.509
 that is the computer 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.979
 We are going to learn 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.209
 now mirror in quito of the trip is very simple because nothing else has 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.999
 three tickets this 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.079
 well red consistency 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.129
 has three entries 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.129
 this simple 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.549
 now let's try 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.549
 with playstation 3 I will not move anything here 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.069
 as well as this one must sound 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.069
 now I'm going to music 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.849
 and in addition to his album on TV 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 and purito rodríguez 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849
 sun 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.989
 now branches I put the normal TV 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.169
 josé maría huarte 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.169
 fiscal 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 Washington 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.099
 I'm going to the pc again 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.099
 the first the playstation 3 to pay it 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.779
 but hey this just as common holding of being just a little help 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.979
 For those who do not know 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.229
 or they want to connect all their audio cables 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.959
 a team like that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.779
 in the necessary because the journalists who are leaving already have their exit 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.089
 of 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.020
 audio 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.929
 a single output for all the audio 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:07.339
 that is, all they have to do is disconnect 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.339
 everything else this time normal 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.900
 you have to connect your omens to audio cassette your audio cables so normal 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.900
 although they are r 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.779
 i want to live 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.919
 It will be the same whether these cables 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.029
 it's going to be the same with the April videos 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.309
 same here 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.779
 and they do not care 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.009
 and nothing else connects in this context that is theirs 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.030
 is with this 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.860
 as for the operative more functionary for a single device that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.529
 those guys 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.629
 and from this 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.029
 in my opinion it is better to be if it has more optic quality and it would be better 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.469
 but it would be less strong that is that it is not rested rome 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.099
 despite the fact that this environment already exists 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.479
 efe d 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.349
 I like it and well they can handle all these with a single audio output 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.259
 and video 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.689
 you will make a little more meat because then these 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.979
 maybe many passes and other equipment 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.979
 as everything that I could be that not 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.620
 but when practically 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.830
 three heads of state what they wanted to show the sound very well 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.449
 mexico april 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.419
 Well then this one I hope it serves those who do not do it for those who 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.689
 do not 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.689
 have you thought those who did not know that you could do this 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.669
 I hope you serve and comment 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.639
 team from your city 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.639
 I'll be doing other of them there may be 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.400
 and well then you 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.389
 greetings and merry christmas to all
