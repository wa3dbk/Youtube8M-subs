00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.399

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.400
 mountain bike but hiking mountain bike opting 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.190
 we talk all day we are not 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.930
 pressed in no hurry but concentrated for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.370
 avoid falling arrows mark out 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.810
 the path and volunteers from 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.390
 cycling clubs in the region 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.409
 indicates the direction 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 it's really a framework is super nice 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.130
 and yes we try not to have too much 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.130
 falls and then we know nor help 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.619
 m 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.549
 from 7 to 77 years is a family event 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.880
 there is something for all tastes mud and 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.399
 the small paths the rocks of the mountains 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.110
 d'arrée has been attracting a further 16 years 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.140
 more vidy lovers 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.729
 so why such a success I think 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.039
 that it is primarily because it is so 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.710
 I think people like it 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.440
 it's the little mountain plus the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.990
 villages but for taste 4 already that's 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.429
 a very tourist site mountain bike mingled with 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.440
 very touristy but it's true that 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.030
 98 we were far from imagining such 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.840
 such frequentation when we have 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.069
 started we were 5 5 clubs and 600 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.600
 people at the lake in huelgoat 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.000
 today the success is such that it takes 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.360
 pre-register on the internet to obtain 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.170
 a place on the day j it's to put 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.700
 on the on the fat vtt and after that 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 security number in case there is a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.580
 worry that has a fall or a piece of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.739
 bike to pick us up 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.150
 we are more than 500 volunteers on weekends 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.470
 it could not be done without them 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.269
 unimaginable but they all had 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.370
 pleasure to show their emails brittany 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.410

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.360
