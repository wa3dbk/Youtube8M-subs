00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.799
 childhood of all i'm natalya nevzorova and me about 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.679
 my friend is sometimes asked a question about 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.460
 whether it is possible to fry the crock-pot 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.640
 In general , my multicooker is very very 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.359
 simple that is, it does not clamp frying 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.720
 at all 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.400
 but I read what I need in the instructions. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:30.759
 fry using mode and cupcake here 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:34.940
 for example i bought a chicken 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.740
 I put and the stock exchange and free of oil that you 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.990
 here you see this is what's on the heat from the street 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:46.670
 at first it was actually extinguished 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.870
 that he naturally has fluid and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.640
 that's literally before the end 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.490
 cooking I generally put on an hour 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.330
 can of course it is possible and in a shorter period of time and 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.680
 and fry new I put on you 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.680
 take chicken 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.460
 first such salt with garlic and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.420
 greens chicken in this salt and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 roll off and just lay out on the bowl 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 close the lid and put on a cupcake on 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.640
 an hour and leave now I have until 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.119
 End cooking 11 minutes after 11 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 minutes 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.729
 we can eat hens already stupid and she 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.070
 reddened and she in own 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.970
 the juice is fried here is not a drop of oil 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.610
 considered a very useful product. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.510
 because she even has a little taste 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.070
 other than fry a skillet or 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.640
 fire oven grilled 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 so you can in any slow cooker 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.270
 using baking roast mode here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.479
 so crust and not necessarily 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.850
 it has a cool crotch with 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.330
 different modes because in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.420
 In principle, I have this multicooker already 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.610
 more than a year and a half have been using 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.370
 but we do not serve faithfully 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.300
 here the only thing you can not cook 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.610
 yogurt 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.620
 if it can be sorted out 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.239
 there is some mode because 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.090
 certain temperature 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.060
 I say to my friends no more playing 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.370
 which multicooker of course can be where 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 regime more there is just more interesting but 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.950
 still you will not cook everything this 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.489
 cost me about two thousand rubles and 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.470
 generally wonderful and cook soups outside 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.380
 porridge and now even mastered frying but 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.670
 and you probably already saw pastries on 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.270
