00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this game you know chicharito had a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.530 
this game you know chicharito had a
pretty<00:03:04.260> decent<00:03:04.350> game<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.330> don't

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
pretty decent game and I just I don't

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.789

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
I think the 4 12 and two formation is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.850 
I think the 4 12 and two formation is
not<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.900> way<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.049> go<00:03:10.319> probably<00:03:10.709> should<00:03:10.799> have

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
not the way to go probably should have

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.970 
not the way to go probably should have
had<00:03:10.980> some<00:03:11.130> wingers<00:03:11.400> maybe<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.670> fourth<00:03:11.940> 43<00:03:12.980> 433
