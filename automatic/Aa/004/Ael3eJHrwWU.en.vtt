this segments would be very short

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.170 
this segments would be very short

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
because it's kind of specialized I've

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.240 
because it's kind of specialized I've
had<00:00:06.450> quite<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.870> few<00:00:06.960> requests<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.950> started

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320 
putting these online lessons on my
website<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.309> explain<00:00:11.700> how<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.940> use<00:00:12.059> an

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
website to explain how to use an

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.999 
website to explain how to use an
asymmetric<00:00:12.990> mouth<00:00:13.170> decent<00:00:13.650> people<00:00:13.950> are

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
asymmetric mouth decent people are

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.640 
asymmetric mouth decent people are
becoming<00:00:14.280> more<00:00:14.519> interested<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.089> them<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.650> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
becoming more interested in them and the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
becoming more interested in them and the
biggest<00:00:17.070> complaint<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.150> they

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
biggest complaint that they have is they

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
biggest complaint that they have is they
go<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> play<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.350> nail<00:00:19.830> sound<00:00:20.189> very<00:00:20.400> good

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
go to play it and nail sound very good

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
go to play it and nail sound very good
and<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:21.000> immediately<00:00:21.180> abandon<00:00:21.779> using<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
and they immediately abandon using the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.370 
and they immediately abandon using the
thing<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> go<00:00:24.930> through<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thing so I'm going to go through a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
thing so I'm going to go through a
detailed<00:00:25.680> discussion<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.820> what's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
detailed discussion of it what's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
interesting is most of what I say is on

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
interesting is most of what I say is on
John<00:00:29.429> Lynch's<00:00:29.789> site<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> asymmetric<00:00:30.960> site

you<00:01:51.430> need<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:51.970> move<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.300> down<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.680> it's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
you need to do is move it down so it's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.370 
you need to do is move it down so it's
maybe<00:01:54.490> one-third<00:01:55.119> upper<00:01:55.420> two-thirds<00:01:55.869> lower

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
maybe one-third upper two-thirds lower

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080 
maybe one-third upper two-thirds lower
you<00:01:56.650> want<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.070> less<00:01:57.400> upper<00:01:57.729> lip<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.000> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
you want to have less upper lip in the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.990 
you want to have less upper lip in the
mouthpiece<00:01:58.510> they<00:01:58.960> seem<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.290> little<00:01:59.410> bit

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
mouthpiece they seem a little bit

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.570 
mouthpiece they seem a little bit
counterintuitive<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> works<00:02:02.470> okay<00:02:03.369> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
counterintuitive but it works okay and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.550 
counterintuitive but it works okay and
the<00:02:04.090> reason<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.540> works<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.110> top<00:02:05.320> part

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the reason it works is that the top part

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.770 
the reason it works is that the top part
of<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.680> Muffy's<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.520> wide<00:02:06.790> so<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.600> allows

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
of the Muffy's is so wide so it allows

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.510 
of the Muffy's is so wide so it allows
you<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.470> move<00:02:08.649> even<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.100> move<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.369> down

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
you if you move even if you move it down

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.760 
you if you move even if you move it down
a<00:02:09.550> little<00:02:09.759> bit<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.360> still<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.840> significant

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
a little bit you still have significant

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.810 
a little bit you still have significant
amount<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.950> upper<00:02:12.130> lip<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.489> mouthpiece

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
amount of upper lip in the mouthpiece

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.820 
amount of upper lip in the mouthpiece
it's<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> big<00:02:13.239> mouth<00:02:13.420> piece<00:02:13.630> at<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.810> top<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.770> I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's a big mouth piece at the top so I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's a big mouth piece at the top so I
will<00:02:15.010> look<00:02:15.070> down<00:02:15.250> lower

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.410 

Oh

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.130 

I<00:02:55.190> know<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.640> may<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.970> high<00:02:57.209> delete<00:02:57.630> melfi's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
I know this may be a high delete melfi's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.740 
I know this may be a high delete melfi's
but<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.920> produces<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> wonderful<00:02:59.970> sound<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
but it produces a wonderful sound in the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.870 
but it produces a wonderful sound in the
lower-middle<00:03:01.050> real<00:03:01.590> register<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.700> use

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
lower-middle real register I can use

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.300 
lower-middle real register I can use
this<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.239> legit<00:03:03.630> kicks<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.410> B<00:03:04.650> flat<00:03:04.680> nine<00:03:05.160> and

used<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.030> switching<00:03:27.300> mouthpieces<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.319> crazy

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
used to switching mouthpieces like crazy

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.740 
used to switching mouthpieces like crazy
playing<00:03:29.190> bass<00:03:29.459> trumpet<00:03:29.730> tacuba<00:03:30.890> Alto<00:03:31.890> horn

flugelhorn and just switching around I

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039 
flugelhorn and just switching around I
developed<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.970> skill<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.390> do<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.870> took

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
developed the skill to do that it took

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.630 
developed the skill to do that it took
me<00:03:37.170> years<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.769> there<00:03:38.040> where<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> could<00:03:38.489> do

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
me years to get there where I could do

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.020 
me years to get there where I could do
that

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
that

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.940 
that
I<00:03:39.060> finally<00:03:39.720> developed<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> idea<00:03:40.920> of

concluding<00:04:12.390> remarks<00:04:12.840> about<00:04:12.959> doing<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
concluding remarks about doing this the

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.920 
concluding remarks about doing this the
main<00:04:14.459> thing<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.850> bring<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.329> down<00:04:15.600> lower

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
main thing is to bring the down lower

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.590 
main thing is to bring the down lower
that's<00:04:16.789> critical<00:04:17.789> if<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.940> don't<00:04:18.090> do<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.359> you

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that's critical if you don't do that you

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.000 
that's critical if you don't do that you
will<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.930> frustrated<00:04:19.140> with<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.560> penalties

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
will be frustrated with this penalties

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.940 
will be frustrated with this penalties
the<00:04:20.910> other<00:04:21.030> thing<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:22.109> fat<00:04:22.350> particles<00:04:22.860> on

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
the other thing is the fat particles on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.520 
the other thing is the fat particles on
the<00:04:23.070> lower<00:04:23.310> lip<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.450> when<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.930> go<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> add

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the lower lip and so when you go to add

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.279 
the lower lip and so when you go to add
pressure<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.310> let's<00:04:26.640> face<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.960> no<00:04:27.960> pressure

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
pressure and let's face it no pressure

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.960 
pressure and let's face it no pressure
is<00:04:28.500> probably<00:04:28.979> not<00:04:29.130> practical<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.640> just<00:04:29.850> want

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
is probably not practical you just want

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.150 
is probably not practical you just want
to<00:04:30.000> use<00:04:30.120> as<00:04:30.300> little<00:04:30.450> pressure<00:04:30.720> as<00:04:30.900> possible<00:04:31.530> so

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
to use as little pressure as possible so

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.590 
to use as little pressure as possible so
when<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.370> go<00:04:32.490> if<00:04:32.970> you're<00:04:33.060> going<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.300> add<00:04:33.450> any

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
when you go if you're going to add any

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.300 
when you go if you're going to add any
pressure<00:04:33.690> it's<00:04:34.200> added<00:04:34.560> mainly<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.130> lower

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
pressure it's added mainly to the lower

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.960 
pressure it's added mainly to the lower
level<00:04:35.870> are<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.140> theory<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.890> if<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.789> go

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
level are the theory is that if you go

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.500 
level are the theory is that if you go
to<00:04:39.150> send<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:39.720> register

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.750 

hire<00:04:46.510> my<00:04:47.080> lower<00:04:47.320> lip<00:04:47.500> came<00:04:47.740> up<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.610> Bell

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
hire my lower lip came up and the Bell

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.090 
hire my lower lip came up and the Bell
came<00:04:49.030> down<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.420> pivot<00:04:49.750> now<00:04:50.530> with<00:04:51.070> a

conventional mouthpiece when your lower
lip<00:04:52.750> comes<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.380> also<00:04:53.530> wants<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.920> try<00:04:54.070> to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
lip comes up it also wants to try to

lip comes up it also wants to try to
pooch<00:04:54.370> into<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:54.760> mouthpiece<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.450> have<00:04:55.780> to

pooch into the mouthpiece you have to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.150 
pooch into the mouthpiece you have to
use<00:04:55.990> these<00:04:56.170> muscles<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.590> kind<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.860> pull<00:04:57.130> it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
use these muscles to kind of pull it

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.910 
use these muscles to kind of pull it
straight<00:04:57.430> up<00:04:57.670> gets<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:58.690> tiring<00:04:58.990> when

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
straight up gets a little tiring when

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.530 
straight up gets a little tiring when
this<00:05:00.100> mouthpiece<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.850> fat<00:05:01.090> wedge<00:05:01.360> in

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
this mouthpiece for that fat wedge in

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.300 
this mouthpiece for that fat wedge in
the<00:05:01.630> bottom<00:05:01.960> when<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.620> go<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.860> create<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.130> lower

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
the bottom when you go to create a lower

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.390 
the bottom when you go to create a lower
lip<00:05:03.490> up<00:05:03.700> it's<00:05:03.970> got<00:05:04.180> no<00:05:04.690> place<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:04.990> go<00:05:05.170> but<00:05:05.650> up

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
lip up it's got no place to go but up

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.430 
lip up it's got no place to go but up
so<00:05:06.580> really<00:05:07.210> helps<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:07.660> sustain<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.230> have<00:05:08.320> to

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
so really helps you sustain you have to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.460 
so really helps you sustain you have to
register<00:05:09.030> for<00:05:10.030> me<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.870> first<00:05:11.080> thing<00:05:11.350> I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
register for me the first thing I

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.860 
register for me the first thing I
noticed<00:05:11.830> was<00:05:12.130> greater<00:05:12.490> endurance<00:05:12.870> more

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
noticed was greater endurance more

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.270 
noticed was greater endurance more
endurance<00:05:14.200> on<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> mouthpiece<00:05:14.710> not<00:05:15.100> more

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
endurance on the mouthpiece not more

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.170 
endurance on the mouthpiece not more
range<00:05:15.870> over<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.990> years<00:05:17.140> as<00:05:17.290> I<00:05:17.380> got<00:05:17.560> the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
range over the years as I got the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.970 
range over the years as I got the
practicing<00:05:19.180> using<00:05:19.990> Lynch's<00:05:20.530> methods<00:05:20.890> a

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
practicing using Lynch's methods a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.950 
practicing using Lynch's methods a
little<00:05:21.010> more<00:05:21.370> carefully<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.120> did<00:05:22.630> find<00:05:22.840> it

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
little more carefully I did find it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.330 
little more carefully I did find it
picked<00:05:23.170> up<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.380> little<00:05:23.560> bit<00:05:23.740> more<00:05:23.890> right<00:05:24.040> but

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
picked up a little bit more right but

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.020 
picked up a little bit more right but
not<00:05:24.520> much

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
not much

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.180 
not much
so<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:26.230> you're<00:05:26.440> going<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.620> if<00:05:26.830> there's<00:05:27.070> any

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
so if you're going to if there's any

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.590 
so if you're going to if there's any
pressure<00:05:27.460> has<00:05:27.670> added<00:05:27.940> mainly<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.420> lower

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
pressure has added mainly to the lower

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.480 
pressure has added mainly to the lower
look<00:05:28.810> what's<00:05:28.960> helping<00:05:29.170> bring<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.530> up<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.370> that

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
look what's helping bring it up and that

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.040 
look what's helping bring it up and that
helps<00:05:30.730> you<00:05:30.820> sustain<00:05:31.150> your<00:05:31.240> upper<00:05:31.450> register<00:05:31.870> I

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
helps you sustain your upper register I

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.840 
helps you sustain your upper register I
do<00:05:32.590> find<00:05:32.980> what<00:05:33.130> I'm<00:05:33.220> going<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.430> play<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.670> Lord

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
do find what I'm going to play the Lord

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:43.160 
do find what I'm going to play the Lord
just<00:05:34.120> err<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.510> tend<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.930> bow<00:05:35.140> long<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.410> little<00:05:35.680> bit

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.020 

wait<00:05:44.170> a<00:05:44.200> bit<00:05:44.470> get<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.400> little<00:05:45.520> register<00:05:45.880> come

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
wait a bit get the little register come

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.480 
wait a bit get the little register come
out<00:05:46.150> but<00:05:46.420> it<00:05:47.140> does<00:05:47.380> come<00:05:47.590> out<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.340> can

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
out but it does come out and you can

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.390 
out but it does come out and you can
really<00:05:48.760> make<00:05:49.120> it<00:05:49.180> come<00:05:49.419> out<00:05:49.510> fairly<00:05:49.870> strong<00:05:50.400> so

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
really make it come out fairly strong so

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.950 
really make it come out fairly strong so
that's<00:05:51.640> how<00:05:51.820> to<00:05:51.850> use<00:05:52.000> an<00:05:52.390> asymmetric

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
that's how to use an asymmetric

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.190 
that's how to use an asymmetric
mouthpiece<00:05:53.350> right<00:05:53.669> there<00:05:54.700> okay<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:56.020> once

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
mouthpiece right there okay and once

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.870 
mouthpiece right there okay and once
