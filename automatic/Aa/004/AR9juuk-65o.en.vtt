00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.510
 Moscow 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.079
 by graffiti I met about 97 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.550
 came out on stage in 98 a piece for 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.379
 piece of year after year 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.359
 now we are here judging ourselves first 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 all of which I do this or 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.079
 otherwise related to graffiti 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 graffiti in the future may be more 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 some interesting laboratories with some 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 new trends there modern 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.820
 art and i always say repeat 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 appetite in general history of the coin two 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.750
 countries on the one hand illegal 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 vandalism on the other hand legal 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.149
 artists who go there in the gallery 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149
 farther 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:02:07.479
 i will go look for miss kim youn sik and duel 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:26.300
 lean on the phone and section a little 70 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
 Like Dislike 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.100
 the danger of his light war in the elf 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.820
 My name is Cyrill My street names revealed 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.730
 i am 25 years old i'm from st. petersburg 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.459
 being engaged in robbing the thirteenth year 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.879
 I actually painted cars on 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.390
 cars I painted advertising fonts 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:13.810
 and after I already encountered graffiti on May 1 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.819
 graffiti was 2002 when I paint 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.400
 think about everything once no goal no 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.459
 chasing graffiti didn't think much 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.670
 over what you do and how you 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.060
 will come out but sometimes you see a picture 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.139
 in advance for the head but 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.239
 populated get another which you 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:39.040
 seen earlier or conceived to do well then 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.470
 I wanted to achieve graffiti 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.359
 made it many years ago at this 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.870
 moment of graffiti for me life style 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:50.010
 I like to joke in graphics 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.099
 artists enjoy this year 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.560
 try to bring something new but 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.849
 the only new thing you can do is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.700
 only combine different styles of design and 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.030
 it calls the new school 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.860
 future graphics will be aesthetic as 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.800
 we all already have the equipment we are the source 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.910
 inspiration of this 7030. eighties 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.030
 90 years I try my graphics together 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.690
 those elements which I am inspired by 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.060
 each metro schedule has its own style so 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.169
 called which they live and they 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.080
 call it your style and i also have 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.710
 your style and this is my style and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.710
 such a joke on graffiti
