00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.900
 Hey, people, here's thiago Brasil. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:34.750
 and today I bring some bf laws games 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:36.650
 4 running on the gt 430 video card of the ex 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.250
 128 bit 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:45.610
 this plate on a very strong plate I 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:50.000
 I have in fact I use the x650 mancheter 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.790
 but I'm bringing the zplay gameplay there 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.850
 campaign and multiplayer there will 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.989
 show how her performance is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.989
 gt 430 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.100
 she is not a very powerful board then 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.710
 Kiss 4 as a new game is 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 Weighing a little, it's a bit 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.340
 Fps fall but you can play 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.920
 everybody play without feeling it there 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:27.950
 that general lockup plus she's got 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 running between 25 20 fs sometimes falls falls 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.400
 more in multiplayer but okay 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.420
 she is running and together with a 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.770
 pc configuration with core i5 4 gb of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.050
 ram is a source of 500 but it is not 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.490
 required to rotate with this card and 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.890
 has a 500-watt power supply and is 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 turning italy until well let's say 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 so but it is if you are still going to buy 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.500
 a board to play 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 I recommend that you dismount one more 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.050
 little money to buy a 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.369
 better than gt 430 not that it is a 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.400
 Bad board but you better think of the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.060
 future and in games that will be coming out 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.400
 there you were a bigger performance game 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.629
 fps the better the higher the fps 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.740
 play there 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.200
 The bigger the pictures, the better for you. 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.620
 the game flows better 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.830
 but if it is other games there normal that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.950
 is not competitively we 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.769
 say so that you do not need to have 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.129
 big performance so you can use 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.420
 this board, no problem, but if it is 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.940
 mp 4 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170
 I would still recommend you're already one 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.470
 little more money 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.970
 but if you already have this card and you do not have 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.760
 how to spend more 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 the game is running face like you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.299
 can you see there I'm sure some 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.299
 people will say it will not work 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:08.200
 always happens I do not know why can 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.319
 be that the psd configuration the person 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.480
 not enough for dinner with the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 plate then I believe I can 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.870
 run well because of my processor 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.510
 huh 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 and I 'm also doing the following I 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.959
 I 'll leave you guys, I'll leave everything there. 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.780
 no low everything on the bass with the resolution 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:34.560
 1441 and leaves everything on bass and 1840 for 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.560
 900 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.109
 all to have a better performance 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.819
 still and it stays there the fps between 25 20 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.250
 sometimes it goes to 30 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.069
 but that story depends on the map 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.690
 also because some maps are better 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.900
 detailed and fps crashes 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.440
 there are other maps are simpler than fps 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.630
 I was better there, I left the fps in the corner 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.060
 top left of the small but I think 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.950
 What can you see in the video? 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.970
 just so you have an idea how it is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.170
 going to be 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.420
 and if you have 171 in personal best 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.900
 still with the memory combs and better 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.720
 will certainly perform better 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.579
 and I'm using windows 7 either 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.849
 I know if on windows 8 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.090
 has an increase and say that it has more 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.960
 I can not affirm here it is me 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.370
 I think some kind of doubt is 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.289
 say something and leave us 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.070
 comments to make the possible answer 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.720
 all there 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.910
 and try to help, right but I already 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.900
