unless my video recording software has
Fross<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:12.500> hopefully<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.739> couple<00:02:13.950> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
Fross so hopefully in a couple of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.530 
Fross so hopefully in a couple of
seconds<00:02:14.700> you'll<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.879> able<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.239> hear<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> audio

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
seconds you'll be able to hear the audio

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.149 
seconds you'll be able to hear the audio
of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> actual<00:02:16.170> game<00:02:16.230> start<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
of the actual game start up in the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.640 
of the actual game start up in the
background<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.900> yeah<00:02:18.900> there<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.349> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
background and yeah there it is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.009 
background and yeah there it is
I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:20.069> yep<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.720> skied<00:02:21.989> here

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
I think yep there we go so I skied here

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.710 
I think yep there we go so I skied here
hopefully<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.189> see<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:24.060> game<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.360> actually

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
hopefully or see the game is actually

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.630 
hopefully or see the game is actually
loading<00:02:25.110> up<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.379> my<00:02:25.530> screen<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.280> audio<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
loading up on my screen and the audio is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.610 
loading up on my screen and the audio is
playing<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> background<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.439> means

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
playing in the background so that means

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.440 
playing in the background so that means
the<00:02:28.829> game<00:02:28.980> has<00:02:29.250> successfully<00:02:29.670> launched<00:02:30.299> and
