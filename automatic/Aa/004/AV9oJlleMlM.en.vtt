simple trailer it is the 1080p mp4 video
so<00:00:41.230> let's<00:00:41.590> try<00:00:41.830> it<00:00:42.239> dot<00:00:43.239> slash<00:00:48.030> simple<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.460> here

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
so let's try it dot slash simple so here

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
so let's try it dot slash simple so here
we<00:00:51.670> go

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.560 

it's<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.350> full<00:00:59.590> 1080p

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.270 

so<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.260> in<00:01:46.530> full<00:01:46.890> HD<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
so that's it in full HD so this is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
so that's it in full HD so this is
another<00:01:50.550> one<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.390> another<00:01:51.750> demo<00:01:52.370> is<00:01:53.510> when<00:01:54.510> we

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
another one this another demo is when we

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.750 
another one this another demo is when we
this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> 3gp<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:58.560> went<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> certain

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
this is in 3gp we went to a certain

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.360 
this is in 3gp we went to a certain

as<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.940> can<00:02:07.090> see<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.930> was<00:02:08.200> recorded<00:02:08.830> using<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.290 

720p<00:02:15.100> camera<00:02:15.930> from<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.320> vent<00:02:18.280> every<00:02:18.580> flavor

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.430 

this<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.510> 1080p<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.970> think<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.050> was<00:02:33.260> in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
this is in 1080p I think this was in

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.080 
this is in 1080p I think this was in
720p<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.350> previous<00:02:36.800> video<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.370> infinitely

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
720p so the previous video is infinitely

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:48.270 
720p so the previous video is infinitely
this<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> 73

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.520 

so<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.970> workers<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:50.930> stored<00:02:51.319> in

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
so this is the workers it's stored in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.100 
so this is the workers it's stored in
the<00:02:51.800> both<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.370> operating<00:02:53.330> system<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
the both the operating system and the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.399 
the both the operating system and the
videos<00:02:57.110> are<00:02:57.500> stored<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.659> micro<00:02:59.659> SD<00:03:00.140> card

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
videos are stored in the micro SD card

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.559 
videos are stored in the micro SD card
it's<00:03:00.830> an<00:03:01.010> eight<00:03:01.159> gig<00:03:01.400> card<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:03.140> sadly<00:03:03.440> i<00:03:04.569> just

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
it's an eight gig card and sadly i just

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's an eight gig card and sadly i just
bought<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.709> i<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:09.140> bought<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.620> class<00:03:10.250> 4

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
bought the i just bought the class 4

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.460 
bought the i just bought the class 4
micro<00:03:11.780> SD<00:03:12.290> card<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.849> it<00:03:13.849> probably<00:03:14.510> helps<00:03:15.049> if<00:03:15.230> we

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
micro SD card so it probably helps if we

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.240 
micro SD card so it probably helps if we
if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.670> purchase<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.510> class<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.069> next

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
if you purchase the class then the next

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.660 
if you purchase the class then the next
time<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.700> visit<00:03:19.730> us<00:03:20.209> higher<00:03:20.480> speeds<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:22.190> both

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
time you visit us higher speeds in both

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.199 
time you visit us higher speeds in both
read<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.120> write<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.410> essentially<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:26.150> is

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
read and write so essentially this is

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.680 
read and write so essentially this is
