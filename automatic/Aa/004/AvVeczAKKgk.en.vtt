let's pop it our test car and see what
it<00:00:17.730> does<00:00:18.770> see<00:00:19.770> what's<00:00:19.920> interesting<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it does see what's interesting about the

it does see what's interesting about the
asteroid<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> bring<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
asteroid is that and you bring one of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
asteroid is that and you bring one of
these<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> car<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.490> no<00:00:23.640> 3G<00:00:24.300> access

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

these into the car it's no 3G access
point<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> plug<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> into<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> USB<00:00:26.220> port

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
point when you plug it into the USB port

point when you plug it into the USB port
in<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> car<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.630> basically<00:00:28.199> turns<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.980> into

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in this car it basically turns it into

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
in this car it basically turns it into

it's<00:00:31.830> advertised<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:33.239> example<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.870> have

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it's advertised as for example you have

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's advertised as for example you have
road<00:00:34.320> trip<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.219> Google<00:00:35.730> map<00:00:36.030> software

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
road trip there's a Google map software

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
road trip there's a Google map software
that'll<00:00:36.840> allow<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.380> point<00:00:37.829> A<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that'll allow you to get point A to

that'll allow you to get point A to
point<00:00:38.040> feet<00:00:38.550> there's<00:00:39.450> also<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:40.110> interesting

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
point feet there's also an interesting

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.819 
point feet there's also an interesting
tuning<00:00:41.550> radio<00:00:41.760> app<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> extreme<00:00:43.170> audio

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and podcasts from the internet but there

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.049 
and podcasts from the internet but there
are<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> couple<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.399> caveats

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
are a couple of caveats

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
are a couple of caveats
for<00:00:48.780> example<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.800> Google<00:00:49.980> Maps<00:00:50.309> software<00:00:50.910> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
for example that Google Maps software it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.610 
for example that Google Maps software it
doesn't<00:00:51.719> give<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> live<00:00:52.170> turn-by-turn

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
doesn't give you live turn-by-turn

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.040 
doesn't give you live turn-by-turn
directions<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.520> update<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.210> it'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
directions and update basically it'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.540 
directions and update basically it'll
give<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.350> directions<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.980> where<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.370> are

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
give you directions from where you are

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.069 
give you directions from where you are
to<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to where you're going but you have to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
to where you're going but you have to
manually<00:00:58.469> advance<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.280> with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> skip

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
manually advance them with the skip

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
manually advance them with the skip
forward<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.780> skip<00:01:00.960> backward<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.489> it's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
forward and skip backward but but it's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
forward and skip backward but but it's
not<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.090> bad<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.690> mean<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.080> starters<00:01:04.170> there's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
not all bad I mean for starters there's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
not all bad I mean for starters there's
a<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.309> great<00:01:05.460> voice<00:01:05.790> command<00:01:06.240> system<00:01:06.420> on

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a really great voice command system on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
a really great voice command system on
here<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> allows<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.830> push<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> button

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
here that allows you to push a button

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
here that allows you to push a button
and<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.570> saying<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> name<00:01:10.140> Gorillaz<00:01:12.680> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and by saying the name Gorillaz and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.609 
and by saying the name Gorillaz and
it'll<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.439> you've<00:01:16.439> also

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it'll do it just like that you've also

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
it'll do it just like that you've also
got<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.460> hands-free<00:01:18.090> calling

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
got a really good hands-free calling

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
got a really good hands-free calling
system<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> asteroid<00:01:20.100> comes

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
system and because the asteroid comes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.999 
system and because the asteroid comes
with<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> dual<00:01:21.030> microphone<00:01:21.770> system<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> has

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
with a dual microphone system that has

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
with a dual microphone system that has
noise<00:01:23.310> cancellation<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.180> echo<00:01:24.540> cancellation

noise cancellation and echo cancellation

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
noise cancellation and echo cancellation
it's<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> best<00:01:26.220> sounding

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it's also one of the best sounding

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's also one of the best sounding
hands-free<00:01:27.720> calling<00:01:28.020> systems<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.920> we've
