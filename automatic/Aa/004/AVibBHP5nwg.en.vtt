00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 telling specific difference 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 period 3 and 2 full review think to do 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 somewhere in a month and when it comes out 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.330

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 Scrolling application was carried out now 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.870
 application this letter rises 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 so you can see it right away 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 look won is in principle not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 very necessary thing and but 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.460
 says let it be also taken away to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.609

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.390
 could find you to turn it on at all 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 hike removed for nexus 5 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.939
 applications are asked before 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.159

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.159

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.070
 third thumbnails first battery 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.030
 began to display not only the time 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.509
 milliamp battery hours also 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.189

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.299
 here it turns out there is bluetooth then 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 There is if these ticks will not teach you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.009

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.270

 unfortunately being all this does not work 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.690
 so nothing more can say 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.730

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:32.489
