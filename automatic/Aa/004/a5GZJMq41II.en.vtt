00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:02.818
 Let's continue with the light topic. 

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:09.310
 Well, the light from the sun may look like white but it actually contains 7 colors. 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:17.853
 Sir Isaac Newton is the first English scientist to divide the sun into 7 light spectrum. 

00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.870
 And I'm sure you've seen the spectrum before, right? 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.940
 And the spectrum is formed due to a process known as dispersion. 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.268
 The dispersion is the separation of white light to its color component by the prism. 

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:54.576
 Thus, when the white light emits through triangular prism, it will be refracted and propagated to form the color spectrum. 

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.729
 So, let's say we have a prism here. 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.373
 Yes, the prism is triangular and made of glass or plastic. 

00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:11.873
 So, if I put white light into the prism ... 

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:20.632
 due to the more dense medium being in the prism, colored light will move at different speeds. 

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:27.268
 Thus, the spread occurs because the light has different colors moving in different speeds in the prism. 

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:33.910
 And the red light has the highest speed and the purple light has the lowest speed. 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.102
 Thus, when the white light enters the prism, the colors in this white light will be separated. 

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:48.012
 And because red light is the fastest, it will be refracted like this. 

00:01:48.012 --> 00:01:49.766
 Other colors will also be the same. 

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.698
 And which light is the slowest moving? 

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:55.295
 It is a light purple. 

00:01:55.295 --> 00:02:03.082
 Therefore, it will be biased and spread more. 

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:05.954
 So we have purple at the end of this spectrum. 

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:11.016
 And in the middle of them, there will be other different colors. 

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:15.207
 I have known before that you ever knew about the rainbow. 

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:18.350
 So, what color can you remember from a rainbow? 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:33.375
 We have red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and purple. 

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:37.372
 So, these are 7 rainbow colors. 

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:46.410
 And keep in mind that red light moves fastest. 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.565
 And purple light moves slowly. 

00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:56.595
 And what else do we need to know? 

00:02:56.595 --> 00:03:02.570
 Hmm .. because the red light moves fastest, the refraction is the least. 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.302
 Yes, the least refraction. 

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:07.899
 This means that it changes the direction of the least. 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.575
 But for the purple light, because it is the slowest, it will spread more. 

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:15.756
 So, it will be refracted over. 

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:20.097
 Well, and these are the colors we can see in the spectrum. 

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:25.132
 Now, the spectrum actually comes from the rainbow. 

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:31.362
 And the rainbow can be seen after the rain in the morning or evening. 

00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:36.805
 The rainbow will become larger when the sun's position is lower. 

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:43.397
 The best position is for the sun to be under the angle of 42 degrees from the horizon. 

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:49.211
 If the sun is at an angle above 42 degrees, the rainbow will not form. 

00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.374
 Well, how can a rainbow be formed? 

00:03:52.374 --> 00:03:54.925
 It is very easy. 

00:03:54.925 --> 00:04:06.465
 Say this is the sun and it rains down early in the morning or late afternoon. 

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:08.845
 So, the right time is during dawn or dusk. 

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:16.738
 So, after the rain there will still be drops of water in the sky. 

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:22.537
 And each drop will serve as a prism. 

00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:34.641
 So, light will enter this drop of water and will be biased and reflected. 

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:40.068
 So, it will change direction and reflect on our eyes. 

00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:43.434
 So, let's say we stand here. 

00:04:43.434 --> 00:04:46.861
 Let me draw. 

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:52.016
 And what we can see is the result of refraction of light. 

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:55.374
 And because of that we can see the colors of the rainbow. 

00:04:55.374 --> 00:05:05.136
 Well, then the sun's rays will flow through the drops of water that will deflate and reflect light and form rainbow. 

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:12.731
 Thus, the primary rainbow is brighter than the secondary rainbow and the main rainbow external band is red. 

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.432
 And the inner band is purple. 

00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:19.599
 So, this is how the rainbow looks. 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.396
 The color is in this sequence. 

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:25.560
 Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple. 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.631
 And sometimes, if you're good enough, you can see a rainbow on top of another rainbow. 

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:39.400
 So, the rainbow is not exactly where we are and we call it a secondary rainbow. 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.477
 This secondary rainbow band is purple and its inner band is red. 

00:05:46.477 --> 00:05:53.517
 So, we just reverse this spectrum for a secondary rainbow. 

00:05:53.517 --> 00:06:01.730
 If we want to make an experiment forming a rainbow at home, it is actually easy. 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:13.709
 So, what we need is a tray or a basin. 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:18.798
 And fill it with water. 

00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:29.407
 And then we just have to put the mirror in the water. 

00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:34.098
 And what we have to do next is to direct them to the sun. 

00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:36.706
 Yes, just point it out to sunlight. 

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:40.832
 And at the other end, we can put one screen. 

00:06:40.832 --> 00:06:50.902
 So, if the angle is correct, the light will be diffused and reflected on the screen. 

00:06:50.902 --> 00:07:00.339
 Then, the light will enter the water, it will be diffused and reflected and it will form the spectrum. 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:05.641
 So, this is an easy experiment in which we can form a spectrum. 

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:09.373
 Well, let's take a look at what we've learned. 

00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:16.677
 In this case, white light is the sunlight pointed at a certain angle on the surface of the water and it will be refracted. 

00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:24.508
 The white light component refracted in the water will be reflected by the mirror. 

00:07:24.508 --> 00:07:30.396
 And this light will be refracted once again before it leaves the water and forms the spectrum. 

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:35.904
 And the rainbow can be formed in the garden during the early morning or late afternoon. 

00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:44.186
 With the sun's position behind, the water drops in the air will help to shape the color spectrum. 

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:48.186
 So you can try this experiment during the holidays and the best time to see the rainbow formed is during dawn or dusk and not forgetting it is after rain. 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
