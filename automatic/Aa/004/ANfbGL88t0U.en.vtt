00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
end result ends up looking like a wrap

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.110 
end result ends up looking like a wrap
bracelet<00:00:38.740> except<00:00:39.160> it's<00:00:39.310> really<00:00:39.520> easy<00:00:39.850> and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.710 
quick to take on and off so all you need
to<00:00:44.440> do<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.950> decide<00:00:45.460> what<00:00:46.030> cords<00:00:46.360> you<00:00:46.450> want<00:00:46.630> to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
to do is decide what cords you want to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
to do is decide what cords you want to
use<00:00:46.870> and<00:00:47.200> how<00:00:47.830> many<00:00:48.010> strands<00:00:48.400> I'm<00:00:48.790> using<00:00:49.450> this

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
use and how many strands I'm using this

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.120 
use and how many strands I'm using this
really<00:00:50.740> pretty

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
really pretty

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.600 
really pretty
waxed<00:00:52.120> cotton<00:00:52.329> cord<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:53.620> decided<00:00:54.250> I<00:00:54.400> wanted

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
waxed cotton cord and I decided I wanted

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.340 
waxed cotton cord and I decided I wanted
to<00:00:54.670> use<00:00:54.790> five<00:00:55.030> strands<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:56.710> go<00:00:57.190> ahead<00:00:57.280> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
to use five strands so I go ahead and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190 
to use five strands so I go ahead and
bundle<00:00:59.350> up<00:00:59.500> my<00:00:59.739> cords<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:01.870> just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
bundle up my cords and then I just

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.770 
bundle up my cords and then I just
measured<00:01:02.920> using<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:04.149> caliper<00:01:05.490> how<00:01:06.490> wide<00:01:06.819> that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
measured using a caliper how wide that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.440 
measured using a caliper how wide that
was<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.109> to<00:01:08.170> be<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.890> fit<00:01:09.130> nicely<00:01:09.399> into<00:01:09.909> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
was going to be to fit nicely into a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.889 
was going to be to fit nicely into a
cord<00:01:11.319> end<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.219> looked<00:01:13.210> at<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.600> and

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
cord end and so I looked at this and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.080 
cord end and so I looked at this and
decided<00:01:14.499> it<00:01:14.649> would<00:01:14.770> fit<00:01:14.979> pretty<00:01:15.249> well<00:01:15.399> into<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
decided it would fit pretty well into a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.510 
decided it would fit pretty well into a
cordon<00:01:16.569> that<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.990> meant<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.039> accommodate<00:01:18.490> a

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
cordon that is meant to accommodate a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.359 
cordon that is meant to accommodate a
four<00:01:18.759> millimeter<00:01:18.939> cord<00:01:19.420> because<00:01:19.929> together

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
four millimeter cord because together

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.969 
four millimeter cord because together
they're<00:01:21.369> about<00:01:21.609> four<00:01:21.789> millimeters<00:01:22.649> so<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.679> have

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
they're about four millimeters so I have

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.849 
they're about four millimeters so I have
these<00:01:24.520> cordon<00:01:25.030> caps<00:01:25.329> here<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:26.530> are<00:01:26.649> meant

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
these cordon caps here that are meant

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.370 
these cordon caps here that are meant
for<00:01:26.950> four<00:01:27.219> millimeter<00:01:27.609> chord<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
for four millimeter chord and then you

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.709 
for four millimeter chord and then you
want<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.709> make<00:01:32.950> sure<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.490> grab<00:01:33.719> your

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
want to make sure that you grab your

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.609 
want to make sure that you grab your
cords<00:01:35.459> not<00:01:36.459> flat<00:01:36.909> but<00:01:37.600> go<00:01:37.719> ahead<00:01:37.929> and<00:01:38.079> you<00:01:38.590> know

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
cords not flat but go ahead and you know

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.109 
cords not flat but go ahead and you know
put<00:01:38.740> them<00:01:39.039> in<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.189> little<00:01:39.459> bundle<00:01:39.639> so<00:01:39.969> that

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
put them in a little bundle so that

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
put them in a little bundle so that
they'll<00:01:40.270> fit<00:01:40.299> in<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.689> round<00:01:40.899> end<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.810> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
they'll fit in the round end and if you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.340 
they'll fit in the round end and if you
feel<00:01:46.060> like<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.359> would<00:01:46.479> be<00:01:46.509> easier<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:47.200> can

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
feel like it would be easier you can

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.609 
feel like it would be easier you can
definitely<00:01:48.359> tie<00:01:49.359> some<00:01:49.630> thread<00:01:49.899> around<00:01:50.049> this

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
definitely tie some thread around this

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.870 
definitely tie some thread around this
like<00:01:50.889> you<00:01:51.009> do<00:01:51.189> when<00:01:51.310> you're<00:01:51.369> ending<00:01:51.639> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
like you do when you're ending a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.179 
like you do when you're ending a
kumihimo<00:01:52.179> braid<00:01:52.689> we<00:01:53.319> do<00:01:53.439> have<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> video<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:53.979> how

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
kumihimo braid we do have a video on how

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.459 
kumihimo braid we do have a video on how
to<00:01:54.219> do<00:01:54.459> that<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:55.899> could<00:01:55.990> definitely<00:01:56.139> do

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
to do that so you could definitely do

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.260 
to do that so you could definitely do
that<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:56.649> I<00:01:56.979> found<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:57.579> not<00:01:57.759> too<00:01:57.999> hard

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
that but I found that it's not too hard

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.709 
that but I found that it's not too hard
to<00:01:58.359> just<00:01:59.079> hold<00:01:59.649> on<00:01:59.859> to<00:01:59.979> them<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.659> all<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.560> do<00:02:02.740> is

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
to just hold on to them so all you do is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:12.620 
to just hold on to them so all you do is
take<00:02:04.719> some<00:02:05.219> e6000<00:02:06.219> glue

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.160 

and<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.950> used<00:02:14.370> flush<00:02:14.730> cutters<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.720> cut<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.020> end

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and I used flush cutters to cut the end

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.550 
and I used flush cutters to cut the end
of<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> cord<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:18.000> give<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.390> nice<00:02:18.540> flat<00:02:19.380> end

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
of the cord to give it a nice flat end

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.430 
of the cord to give it a nice flat end
go<00:02:22.560> ahead<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.880> ends

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
go ahead and get all of your ends

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.320 
go ahead and get all of your ends
together<00:02:25.440> I'll<00:02:25.830> make<00:02:26.430> sure<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.060> ends

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
together I'll make sure all of the ends

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.990 
together I'll make sure all of the ends
are<00:02:27.450> even<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:31.100> put<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> decent<00:02:32.610> amount<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
are even and just put a decent amount of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.610 
are even and just put a decent amount of
glue<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.360> end<00:02:33.450> don't<00:02:33.870> overdo<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.410> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
glue on the end don't overdo it you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.320 
glue on the end don't overdo it you
don't<00:02:34.830> want<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.130> seep<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.550> lot<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.120> make

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
don't want it to seep out a lot but make
