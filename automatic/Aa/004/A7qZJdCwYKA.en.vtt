Railway<00:02:51.070> jobs<00:02:51.460> are<00:02:51.700> harder<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:53.350> these

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
Railway jobs are harder to see but these

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.830 
Railway jobs are harder to see but these
jobs<00:02:54.130> are<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.670> as<00:02:54.910> important

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
jobs are just as important

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.980 
jobs are just as important
like<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.070> engineers<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.940> fix<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.510> engines

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
like the engineers that fix the engines

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.980 
like the engineers that fix the engines
when<00:02:59.230> they<00:02:59.380> break<00:02:59.680> down<00:02:59.710> and<00:03:00.460> who<00:03:01.210> wash<00:03:01.570> and

when they break down and who wash and
polish<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.620> engines<00:03:03.130> at<00:03:03.310> wash<00:03:03.550> down<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.690> they

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
polish the engines at wash down so they

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.290
