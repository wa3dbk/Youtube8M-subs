00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
has happened in the past when we get a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.990 
has happened in the past when we get a
shorter<00:00:32.020> scheduler<00:00:32.559> games<00:00:32.830> the<00:00:33.430> slate<00:00:33.790> is

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
shorter scheduler games the slate is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.670 
shorter scheduler games the slate is
split<00:00:34.270> in<00:00:34.390> half<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:34.900> got<00:00:35.080> seven<00:00:35.500> night

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
split in half so we got seven night

shorter schedule pitching leaves a lot

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.660 
shorter schedule pitching leaves a lot
to<00:01:10.360> be<00:01:10.630> desired<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.290> I<00:01:11.320> think<00:01:11.440> Kershaw<00:01:12.159> Felix

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
to be desired so I think Kershaw Felix

to be desired so I think Kershaw Felix
Hernandez<00:01:13.150> are<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> obvious<00:01:13.600> too<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.950> you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
Hernandez are the obvious too but you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.130 
Hernandez are the obvious too but you

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.650 
an instant auto plug for me lately at
that<00:01:53.410> price<00:01:53.680> tag<00:01:54.010> so<00:01:54.280> he<00:01:54.880> hits<00:01:55.000> right-handers

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
that price tag so he hits right-handers

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.230 
that price tag so he hits right-handers
while<00:01:55.980> 376<00:01:56.980> this<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.310> weighted<00:01:57.640> on-base<00:01:57.730> gets

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
while 376 this is weighted on-base gets

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.450 
while 376 this is weighted on-base gets
Alfredo<00:01:58.659> Simon<00:01:58.960> tonight<00:01:59.440> who<00:01:59.920> has<00:02:00.130> pitched

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
Alfredo Simon tonight who has pitched

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.310 
Alfredo Simon tonight who has pitched
well<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:01.030> think<00:02:01.480> he's<00:02:01.570> pitching<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.230> bit

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
well I think he's pitching a little bit

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.350 
well I think he's pitching a little bit
above<00:02:02.530> his<00:02:02.680> head<00:02:02.830> though<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.340> ignore<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.180> nine

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
above his head though so ignore the nine

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.420 
above his head though so ignore the nine
wins<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.870> think<00:02:05.080> Pittsburgh<00:02:05.290> could<00:02:05.950> get<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> him

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
wins I think Pittsburgh could get to him

wins I think Pittsburgh could get to him

that's<00:04:01.570> our<00:04:01.780> max<00:04:02.049> today<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.280> certainly

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
that's our max today but I certainly

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.060 
that's our max today but I certainly
think<00:04:04.060> he's<00:04:04.269> worth<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.750> not<00:04:05.200> many<00:04:05.530> first<00:04:05.829> base

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070

certainly<00:04:10.870> looks<00:04:11.079> good<00:04:11.320> but<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.620> price<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.890> so

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
certainly looks good but the price is so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.190 
certainly looks good but the price is so

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.210 
this way that I'm based against
left-handed<00:05:16.900> pitching<00:05:17.190> certainly<00:05:18.190> a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
left-handed pitching certainly a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.310 
left-handed pitching certainly a
boom-bust<00:05:18.700> option<00:05:19.300> but<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.570> power<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.990> there

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
boom-bust option but the power is there

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.380 
boom-bust option but the power is there
we've<00:05:20.860> seen<00:05:21.160> huge<00:05:21.460> games<00:05:21.760> out<00:05:22.000> of<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.180> sky

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
we've seen huge games out of the sky

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.230 
we've seen huge games out of the sky
before<00:05:22.620> double<00:05:23.620> dong<00:05:23.830> games<00:05:24.220> I<00:05:24.550> expect

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
before double dong games I expect

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.790 
before double dong games I expect
another<00:05:25.419> big<00:05:25.690> game<00:05:25.720> tonight<00:05:26.200> against<00:05:26.440> de<00:05:26.620> la

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
another big game tonight against de la

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.790 
another big game tonight against de la
Rosa<00:05:26.980> who<00:05:27.760> struggle<00:05:28.270> with<00:05:28.300> righties<00:05:28.780> 348<00:05:29.560> is

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
Rosa who struggle with righties 348 is

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.550 
Rosa who struggle with righties 348 is
weighted<00:05:30.130> on-base<00:05:30.250> this<00:05:30.669> season<00:05:31.150> 3<00:05:31.690> 51<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.410> his

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
weighted on-base this season 3 51 is his

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.290 
weighted on-base this season 3 51 is his
weighted<00:05:32.890> on-base<00:05:32.980> allowed<00:05:33.520> over<00:05:33.850> his<00:05:33.940> career

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
weighted on-base allowed over his career

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.510 
weighted on-base allowed over his career
so<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.020> right-handed<00:05:35.590> bats<00:05:35.770> are<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.040> Dodgers

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
so the right-handed bats are the Dodgers

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.310 
so the right-handed bats are the Dodgers
certainly<00:05:37.330> something<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.660> look<00:05:37.810> at<00:05:37.990> tonight

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320
