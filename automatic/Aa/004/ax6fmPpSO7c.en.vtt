00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.700
 Let's travel to the past with a moment 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.710
 namely half of the 90 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.950
 It was the heyday of a small device 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.840
 quite nice called game boy 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.390
 next to the small portable console 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.129
 launched a series of emblematic titles 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 however the game that really the 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.600
 broke was a rpg called pocket 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.930
 monsters in which you could capture 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 a series of monsters to then fight 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 against other friends thanks to the function 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.379
 of the console however or pocket 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 Monsters known later as 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 pokemon in the west besides good 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.430
 critics also received a series of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 urban legends that were growing to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.559
 from the small details in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.030
 Styles 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.550
 obviously as it expected the great 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.070
 most turned out to be false but others 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.140
 were totally true this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.840
 story that I am about to tell in 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 part is true but also presents 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.210
 a party that wants interpretation of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 each 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.729
 the pokemon number 64 from the list of 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.830
 original game was the so-called corpse the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.479
 which according to the plot of the game is a 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.479
 monster that has the power to dominate 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.220
 the psychic forces generally 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.350
 channel this great power by bending 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.330
 spoons alone with the power of your mind 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.820
 out of its shape similar to that of a 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.770
 fox cadabra and his whole family is 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.200
 inspired by great magicians of all 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.600
 times our character is inspired 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.000
 specifically in a person called uri 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.479
 geller in fact the Japanese name of 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.190
 cadabra is one killer which is 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 tremendously similar to his 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.770
 for those who do not locate it uri geller is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.900
 a well-known psychic who assured 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.290
 be able to bend spoons using their power 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.290
 sic 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.190
 advancing a little more in time in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.319
 1997 a series of letters was published 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.660
 inspired by pokemon which would be 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.120
 quite popular in japan tells the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.580
 legend that in November of the year 2000 the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.069
 sir that you requirement japan in that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.530
 moment he noticed cadabra remaining 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.870
 astonished to see that nintendo the creator 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.790
 of that character had practically 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.790
 plagiarized his name and his image 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.870
 the case was so big that they decided 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.730
 take him to court demanding 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.980
 nintendo for almost 100 million 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.620
 dollars and although eventually the case is 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.930
 discarded geller was angry since 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.659
 according to him they had linked his image to 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 Nazi symbols but what elements of 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.860
 cadabra are those that supposedly 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.780
 they avoided uri geller so much for 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.610
 discover it we have to be more 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.659
 retailers when looking at the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.659
 corpse design 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.920
 as we said the pokemon seems to have 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.450
 a form of anthropomorphic fox in addition 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.490
 presents a series of symbols in its 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.069
 body we clearly see a star in 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.760
 his forehead and three lines snaked in 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.980
 your pelvis 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.650
 this can be more than simple ornaments 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.459
 since it can be interpreted as symbols 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.260
 nazis 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.650
 specifically related to 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.629
 squadron waffen ss which was a 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.909
 combat body that fought under the 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.510
 hitler control in the second war 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.760
 world, the direct reference would be 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.890
 official symbol of the squadron which is 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.920
 tremendously similar to the shape of 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.569
 girls of cadabra besides the star that 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.900
 have in your head would come to mean 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.269
 a typical war medal although the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.310
 official explanation of nintendo is that 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.250
 these symbols would be a reference to 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.350
 the so-called henan letters which 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.590
 were used to study possible 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.960
 cases of extrasensory perception these 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.830
 letters were created by the doctor call 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.330
 center and the parapsychologist jb rain 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.330
 during the 20s 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.710
 however, if we are a little more 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.450
 observers we can find the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.450
 possible inspiration of the character 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.080
 at the beginning we said that the pokemon 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.660
 It had the shape of a fox 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.490
 anthropomorphic this next to that if we 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.830
 we fix well we see that each work 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.860
 presents legs quite similar to the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.539
 classic representation of demons 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.610
 added to that the star of his head is 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.520
 an associated five-pointed star 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.139
 commonly to black magic and even more so its 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.440
 head has the shape of a star of 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.750
 five points inverted 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.300
 adding up all this makes the most 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.220
 probable inspiration of this pokemon be 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.220
 a being known as low goal 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.490
 ah 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.250
 i 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.830
 buffett was originally linked to the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.270
 figure of a pagan god is to say a being 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.400
 that represents everything foreign to 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.500
 Christianity although it is mainly 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.180
 known to be one of the symbols 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.210
 main gentlemen 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.580
 Templars' and other occult groups 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.080
 although recently it has been associated 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.080
 image of a satanic being 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.540
 low goal really is a very figure 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.520
 interesting and maybe in the future 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.789
 let's talk more in depth about this 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.680
 mythical to be the truth is that this 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.449
 story that linked homer with each 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.330
 work most likely is just one 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.310
 coincidence although finally nintendo 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.620
 decided to remove the pokemon card from 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.840
 his card game and curiously the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.160
 retired letter showed each work 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.830
 making a gesture with his hand 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.449
 left that curiously represents 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.139
 one of the classic symbols of 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:35.870
 satanism who knows perhaps the story 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.370
 is more than a simple coincidence 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.500
 I leave for you to take out your own 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.699
 conclusions a greeting to all and we 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.699
 we see for the next
