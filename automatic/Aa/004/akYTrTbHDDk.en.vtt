00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.870
 human resources 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.169
 The money is running out 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.919
 Cleanly 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.540
 As you know this village is 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.730
 Duskin mining was the region's infrastructure as this humane village 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.369
 People throughout the village were decorated with people who could mine from the mined light 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.749
 It was an example on that 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.609
 However, in this village where you see it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.519
 There is no one more silver 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.749
 Aren't you a heir? 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.040
 But they testified in business software sales with nine people 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 The gold-eyed one is still better in Tiananmen Square 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 It is the former's gesture, isn't it? 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.100
 Applicants are just as they are 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.380
 I became interested in 2007 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 West Asian silver will be collected from February 8 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.249
 New Year's Eve again 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.269
 It must have been a close relationship starting in this year 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.989
 Many people 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.620
 I am about seven thousand two hundred hundred grams 3 that the deduction from Scrum is also intense 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.110
 It was a big decline in the first half 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140
 Maruyama 6th 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.210
 I just signed up a few weeks ago 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.860
 It is said that only this time 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 Did you come to the top coat of Hosokawa from the country? 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 In the flash 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.730
 There was a shell man 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.730
 A person from outside came to the hysteria 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.170
 Speaking of which, I said that I would go to the village to follow 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.690
 Do you know x by a few of your sex? 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.630
 That's right 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.710
 Please take me further and let me be in the back 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 The 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.430
 Well then I built and owned 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.950
 Kofu what this has returned 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.360
 It became a teaching rule 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.080
 Please wait at my house tonight 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.450
 Let's guide local houses even tomorrow morning 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.400
 I am sorry 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.770
 Resume traffic 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.050
 I bowed my head 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.220
 I wanted to work in the whole sea 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 The city is great 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.659
 A ruling party 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.489
 Personal 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.969
 It's a shame to send out on the way home and go out of the village with the wind alone 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.819
 I wanted 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
 Yokohama Kudo was high 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.959
 6. 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.019
 Nakagawa 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.589
 It was only eight people this time 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.829
 Optimized for applications where you still have a good experience 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.609
 You will receive 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 On the 6th, in Ho Chi Minh City, Tsuru Maru made his debut 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.669
 Major League Yankees took over 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.290
 According to the mouth of Yamada Denki and the situation in North Korea 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.789
 I think it's bad 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.109
 Unusual work done unusually in proposal, etc. Figure 4 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.729
 The fan went up 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.559
 British mechanism 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.659
 It was saved by the evolution of two people's South Tohoku 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.989
 Did you know 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.069
 Satoshi Aso You are the legendary hero 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.679
 Of course you are listening from the plate 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:14.959
 Please send me 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.839
 Assertion of the legendary hero 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.849
 Such things to notify the ground get a seal 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.939
 Please let me go 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.389
 Even just one after another for the attack of the former 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.049
 Everyone is usable 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.279
 Even now it is a phenomenon that 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.279
 I want something that I can believe 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.139
 Legendary gun society 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.689
 voice 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.969
 Also 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 Just after 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.279
 But 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.659
 I am sorry 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 Did you wake up? 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.129
 It is a very beautiful song 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.529
 It is the lightest if it is not this contents 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.689
 I'm playing a heartwarming song 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.479
 The main cause is not getting used to such 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.889
 I hear only sad songs 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.189
 The present station is something that has been made for a long time in my house 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.190
 This song is attached to Mr. Hoki Tsuna like saying bad 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.219
 I am 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.680
 It may be useful for something 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 Can you hear me 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.850
 I got Starkiep 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.279
 Review of nutritional value 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.590
 I heard that I met Niigata City Nishi Ward 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.349
 3 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.879
 Of training 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.129
 11214 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.129
 It seems that there are many parts that flock 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.409
 Large 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.830
 Pray further 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.629
 Pass the same to other famous 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.699
 main 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.150
 Overwhelming iaea became drinking this morning 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.210
 panel 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.129
 Feel enthusiastic 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.020
 But do 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.389
 It is a figure 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.389
 Prepare for dialect 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.599
 But until some years ago 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.870
 I was waiting for the legendary brave in the palace like Sarah 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.610
 How many clans have been there since the time when no one appeared 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.249
 while 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.249
 I've made up only to wait forever 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:46.220
 Yes 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.220
 I'm writing and I'm writing hair ideas too 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.710
 I was able to play from the relay this time 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.699
 Furthermore, although it is only sold to Mr. Tetsunaga 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.669
 Luckily I think it is my life 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.129
 Urawa era has arrived 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.990
 That's it 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.389
 It is called zebari foreign silver 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:07.759
 Buyer lost 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.229
 28% of boys 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.990
 I will leave the horse this fall 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.990
 Entrust anxiety that can not be dealt with 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.099
 I want to go to a linear self-employed terminal 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:28.559
 1 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.650
 End 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.000
 The voice of the site 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:40.009
 mobile phone 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.009
 I can not say anything from me 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:44.580
 today 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.210
 I took a customer to you 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.290
 Can not come out 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.509
 I have not seen that in my perspective 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:52.889
 It is with you 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.189
 I've always been looking for 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:59.189
 Then I'll withdraw by the passing party 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.259
 See you again 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:01.979
