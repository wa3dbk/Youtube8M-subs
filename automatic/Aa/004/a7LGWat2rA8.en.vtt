00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.519
 came out the new version of minecraft and now 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 I bring you a mode that is for 1.4 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.600
 points 2 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 is the prehistoric mod and good this way 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.070
 common how is the name is the mode of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 the prehistory that good adds a new 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 dimension to minecraft which is the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 dimension of prehistory so 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.740
 well we can say this is a small 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.719
 thing we have built with things 1.4 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.239
 good and the first thing that I'm going to show you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.100
 they hope how to eliminate all this what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.660
 we have to prove is this is the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 time machine that what in capturing 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.330
 to do portal down here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.780
 here this is the crater of the machine of 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.390
 time then you fabric kraft eas with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.330
 two subjects that you ask for there you put it in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 a how it is here in a place you make it 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.350
 Right click and transform your machine on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 weather 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.230
 I will go into this because I came here and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.050
 and good important 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.120
 so here we are in this new 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.970
 dimension every time you enter the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.440
 portal had you given a book that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.240
 this is called the book of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.850
 Fretting that brings all the punishments that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.119
 are possible with this mode with material 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.400
 that brings and good this mountain in this 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.200
 dimension and adds nine different biomes 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.200
 that this Friday is precisely the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 does not say island island I think good 99 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 languages ​​and 13 new modes so let's 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.149
 out there to see what we have here we have 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.750
 the new trees these rare here 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:45.890
 we have a dragonfly that is precisely 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.299
 a process that in ways is that he saw more 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.789
 this and island 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.479
 islanders here we are in the swamp if 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.600
 I'm not mistaken a swamp as you can 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 see what impresses most of this is the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.929
 look water because look 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 here in this area you can appreciate 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:11.310
 much better how water changes how 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.150
 tone that this in the normal world does not 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.060
 could do 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.069
 and good as surrenders things this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.069
 and here we are in a swamp 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.120
 this mode would be very good to do 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.060
 type a a series a series of robots or 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.760
 that serra had to the past I do not know 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.750
 anything but look here we have is 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.750
 black lines 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.240
 Afternoon line that if you killed him from 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.290

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.010
 let's grab a sword 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 an egg has nothing with you 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.380
 half a mini line another mini on a motorcycle 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.930
 if there are owners that's a 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.890
 a material 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.890
 botafoc 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.360
 listen to the sounds 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.159
 impressive and good this way to have 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.500
 had in several ways adds many 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.540
 materials that precisely here have 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.790
 all these are materials that adds the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.950
 mode 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.810
 some the little plants these things or the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 sounds of dinosaurs are scary 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.750
 even if it's already done in half cagón 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.969
 but what else do we have slim and motor 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.950
 dragonfly there we have other dinosaurs 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.560
 what dinosaurs this I have no idea 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.430
 because and there we have another mobile that is 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.489

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.850
 I have no idea if these dinosaurs 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.170

 with volcano rock quite and good 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.000
 this was the world of prehistory but 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.979
 historic for 1.4 point 2 works 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.930
