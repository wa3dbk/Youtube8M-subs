00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.940 
together we're going to fold that in
half<00:02:13.370> stick<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> right<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> middle<00:02:15.180> there

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950

just<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.129> that<00:02:17.370> now<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.000> how<00:02:18.120> we're

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
just like that now this is how we're

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.780 
just like that now this is how we're
going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> make<00:02:18.569> our<00:02:18.629> bow<00:02:19.099> we're<00:02:20.099> going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.400> tie

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
going to make our bow we're going to tie

a<00:02:20.819> knot<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.940> try<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.420> right<00:02:24.690> in

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a knot and try to get the not right in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.890 
a knot and try to get the not right in
the<00:02:24.930> middle<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.500> white<00:02:25.709> piece

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the middle of that white piece

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
the middle of that white piece
and<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.439> we're<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.650> going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> pull<00:02:28.250> really

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and then we're just going to pull really

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.690 
and then we're just going to pull really
tight<00:02:29.000> while<00:02:29.780> straightening<00:02:30.409> it<00:02:30.709> out<00:02:30.829> along

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
tight while straightening it out along

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.530 
tight while straightening it out along
the<00:02:31.939> way<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:33.319> now<00:02:33.500> when<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.709> flip<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.189> over<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the way so now when I flip it over you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.809 
the way so now when I flip it over you
can<00:02:35.720> see<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.709> can<00:02:36.799> scrunch<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.489> up<00:02:37.670> if

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
can see and you can scrunch this up if

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.190 
can see and you can scrunch this up if
you<00:02:37.939> want<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.390> smaller<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.959> middle

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you want it to be smaller in the middle

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.300 
you want it to be smaller in the middle
which<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.409> like<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.860> be<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> little<00:02:40.129> bit

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
which I like it to be a little bit

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.479 
which I like it to be a little bit
smaller<00:02:40.549> in<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.819> middle<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> tighter

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
smaller in the middle and the tighter

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.670 
smaller in the middle and the tighter
you<00:02:43.609> pull<00:02:43.939> it<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> more<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.689> bow<00:02:45.049> but<00:02:45.439> we
