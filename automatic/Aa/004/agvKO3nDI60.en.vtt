case you do you need um I should go to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.389 
case you do you need um I should go to
another<00:00:29.010> world<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.750> warp<00:00:31.730> survival<00:00:32.730> I

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
another world which is warp survival I

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.950 
another world which is warp survival I
can't<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:36.120> nothing<00:00:36.750> because

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
can't do nothing because

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.470 
can't do nothing because
it<00:00:39.410> only<00:00:39.770> works<00:00:40.129> in<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.340> plot<00:00:40.700> world<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.149> if<00:00:41.300> I

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it only works in the plot world so if I

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.560 
it only works in the plot world so if I
do<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:42.010> warp<00:00:43.010> blood<00:00:44.000> world

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570

that's basically parole plugins so let's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.380 
that's basically parole plugins so let's
go<00:01:14.160> here<00:01:15.260> compass<00:01:16.260> navigation<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:17.250> chose<00:01:17.910> nine

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
go here compass navigation I chose nine

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
go here compass navigation I chose nine
till<00:01:18.660> klocke<00:01:18.990> cause<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:20.070> compass<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
till klocke cause if your compass and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.740 
till klocke cause if your compass and
what<00:01:21.720> ticket<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.310> gives<00:01:23.730> it<00:01:23.940> this<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
what ticket it gives it this is this to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.190 
what ticket it gives it this is this to
there<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.310> change<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.150> clock<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.990> can

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
there so I change it up clock you can

everything there so basically yeah the
third<00:01:48.330> one<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.720> got<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:51.770> multiverse<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.550> with

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
third one we got is multiverse now with

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
third one we got is multiverse now with
multiples<00:01:54.480> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> create<00:01:54.960> randomized

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
multiples you can create randomized

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.240 
multiples you can create randomized
world<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.370> one<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.240> us<00:01:57.390> who<00:01:57.540> ate<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.250> stuff

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
world with one of us who ate and stuff

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.890 

I<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> capture<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> flag

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
I can go to capture the flag

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:29.380 
I can go to capture the flag
here

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:45.800 

I<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.950> find<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.490> is

it is a awesome thing for building but

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.840 
it is a awesome thing for building but
also<00:03:44.270> dangerous<00:03:44.990> it<00:03:45.860> might<00:03:46.160> grief<00:03:46.520> your

um<00:04:12.610> well<00:04:13.610> guard<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.660> region<00:04:15.320> protection<00:04:16.070> so

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
um well guard is a region protection so

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.420 
um well guard is a region protection so
