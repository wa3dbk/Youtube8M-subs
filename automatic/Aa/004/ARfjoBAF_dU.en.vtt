00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello everyone, Vladimir Tikhonov and you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.710
 sports theater passed 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.960
 now we will study webster in the winter i 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.309
 released a tutorial on the front site who 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.469
 ca n't front flip desirable 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.870
 watch this tutorial there told 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.480
 all the fundamentals of a forward coup mean 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 backster we start with what we need 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.730
 understand how to push off push 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.260
 happens in such a leap alternating leg 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.099
 push always comes with a bent 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.050
 legs push it turns out and two 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.590
 legs that pushes Islands and swing 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 other leg 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.469
 more convenient to do webster 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.800
 hillock when you have this leg is surprised 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.300
 a little higher you have more power 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.039
 will be further on extra looks like this well 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.410
 make a firovo 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.270
 that's when a lot of strength doing better 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 when crush immediately speak here too 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.000
 need to warm up necessarily because 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.120
 you can stretch your legs here 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.250
 then bottle hurt so mean first 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.200
 you need to learn before her flasks but 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 looks like that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 good about earth i don't have it 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.240
 so i take on that leg but not so report 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.970
 wrong means and do it 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.060
 so you lose backbend here 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.750
 this flag is the same 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.630
 brushing off only the newly shut foot slightly 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.210
 straighter and so I lost 1 pair of hyp me 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 Unknown where not there had not sag 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.970
 lose 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.610
 you land it faster and in straight 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.220
 growth 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.380
 then first learn to do it before 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.920
 many people are afraid of this they lower by 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 one leg, hand, and they do so here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 so bulat is wrong 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.520
 it means it's just a fear factor 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.130
 those who are afraid to lower the two arms 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.090
 just afraid to teach the day to soft 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.630
 maybe it's afraid to walk but 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 mean for front learned further 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.350
 goes the very eye of the site itself 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.990
 if you lichkoy surface such 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:38.190
 soft hill though there 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.190
 apply to do somersaults of such a stage 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.900
 have you spin mean you 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.380
 Twist the site is not a fact that the legs but 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:53.350
 somehow you load so portal shock 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.090
 here this one we remember how and there this 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.170
 the jump is generally called a waltz with when 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.050
 you apply legs as you need here 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.180
 such an arc push yourself 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.270
 some make such a mistake they make 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:15.010
 front flip so generally wrong 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:18.790
 that's how we do all the attempts here 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:26.410
 so smoothly joint keep everything 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.360
 health scan their here and so first 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.820
 part shot honestly came up with eccentricities 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.460
 why so now a little more in detail 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.930
 what does the body and hands during 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.000
 coup when soak foot masses 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.730
 hands at the same time go in this 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.810
 direction they make a similar swing 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.640
 adds to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.990
 twist the body must necessarily pull 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.640
 behind the legs 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.660
 because if you won't pull you 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.260
 something like that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.720
 and if you pull it you add yourself 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.300
 more twists well maybe even from that height 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.170
 you download that is relax in 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.170
 no flip time 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.390
 many more are starting to learn webster here 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.690
 such a swing 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.430
 be careful here because 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.220
 you can that's why in touch by 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:32.570
 semi start spinning and do not screw me 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:34.070
 so once fell here apparently in principle 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.910
 it only remains 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.410
 jiggle so that the departure was more about 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.300
 this I told in the video clip about 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.750
 back flip look here for this 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.910
 reference 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.070
 so the main thing is shorter we subscribe to 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.330
 channel guarantee that you learn 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.100
 webster how rises 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.100
 good luck to you all
