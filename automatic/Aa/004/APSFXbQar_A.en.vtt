features<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.820> using

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
features if you're going to be using

features if you're going to be using
this<00:00:42.120> bike<00:00:42.390> day<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> day<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.350> for

this bike day in and day out for
different<00:00:44.190> types<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> weather<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.879> have

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
different types of weather you have

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260 
different types of weather you have
internal<00:00:45.960> cable<00:00:46.320> routing<00:00:46.469> or<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.910> shifters

internal cable routing or the shifters

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.369 
internal cable routing or the shifters
and<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> feature<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> don't

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
typically see on hybrid bikes but they

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
typically see on hybrid bikes but they
