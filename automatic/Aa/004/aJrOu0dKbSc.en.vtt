00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
you use them as overlap as if you hold

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.219

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.600 
of all the formations we did play with
because<00:05:15.779> as<00:05:16.020> we<00:05:16.169> know<00:05:16.199> 352<00:05:17.039> has<00:05:17.310> been<00:05:17.490> my

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
because as we know 352 has been my

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.790 
because as we know 352 has been my
dominant<00:05:17.969> formation<00:05:18.449> over<00:05:18.599> fifa<00:05:19.199> 13<00:05:19.229> and

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
dominant formation over fifa 13 and

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.399 
dominant formation over fifa 13 and
probably<00:05:20.370> will<00:05:20.550> continue<00:05:20.969> to<00:05:21.120> do<00:05:21.389> so<00:05:21.629> for<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
probably will continue to do so for the

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.320 
probably will continue to do so for the
next<00:05:22.439> couple<00:05:22.740> years<00:05:22.919> really<00:05:23.370> probably<00:05:24.120> will

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
next couple years really probably will

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.670 
next couple years really probably will
be<00:05:24.449> about<00:05:24.629> next<00:05:24.960> year<00:05:25.110> as<00:05:25.229> well<00:05:25.289> it'd<00:05:25.439> be<00:05:25.499> fun

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
be about next year as well it'd be fun

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.350 
be about next year as well it'd be fun
to<00:05:25.800> do<00:05:25.919> again<00:05:26.159> see<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.639> formations<00:05:27.240> have

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
to do again see the formations have

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.189

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
what was very weak when i used it it

would<00:06:07.740> be<00:06:07.860> very<00:06:08.039> very<00:06:08.669> similar<00:06:08.969> for<00:06:09.120> the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
would be very very similar for the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.769 
would be very very similar for the
people<00:06:09.539> who<00:06:09.569> use<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.139> now<00:06:10.289> as<00:06:11.250> saw<00:06:11.639> next<00:06:12.629> year
