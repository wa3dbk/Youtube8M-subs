00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
check my vid on that and you can also

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
check my vid on that and you can also
open<00:00:56.280> sbsettings<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.239> rotated<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
open sbsettings when it's rotated and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.299 
open sbsettings when it's rotated and
I'm<00:00:58.289> sure<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.770> things<00:00:58.890> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I'm sure you can do other things but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.410 
I'm sure you can do other things but
that's<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.120> noticed

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that's just one thing that I noticed

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.830 
that's just one thing that I noticed
right<00:01:00.600> away<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.460> opens

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
right away so as you can see it opens

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.240 
right away so as you can see it opens
parallel<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.830> pretty<00:01:05.159> cool<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:07.409> here

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
parallel so it's pretty cool so now here

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.109 
parallel so it's pretty cool so now here
is<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.760> download<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.970> first<00:01:11.970> you're

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
is how to download it so first you're

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.100 
is how to download it so first you're
going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.840> cydia<00:01:14.570> which<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> always<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
going to go into cydia which is always a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to go into cydia which is always a
real<00:01:16.350> pain<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> open

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.310 

and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:25.210> see<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.720> actually<00:01:25.900> locks

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and then you see that it actually locks

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.990 
and then you see that it actually locks
when<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.620> go<00:01:26.770> into<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.010> application<00:01:27.130> so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
when you go into the application so

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.690 
when you go into the application so
won't<00:01:28.570> rotate<00:01:28.860> unnecessarily<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.370> go<00:01:30.640> to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
won't rotate unnecessarily so go to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.540 
won't rotate unnecessarily so go to
