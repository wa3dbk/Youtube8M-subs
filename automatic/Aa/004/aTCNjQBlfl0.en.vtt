what<00:00:16.030> we're<00:00:16.209> gonna<00:00:16.270> do<00:00:16.600> is<00:00:17.290> we're<00:00:17.650> gonna<00:00:17.770> time

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna time

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.620 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna time
how<00:00:18.160> long<00:00:18.460> it<00:00:18.640> takes<00:00:18.760> for<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.210> ping<00:00:19.390> pong<00:00:19.420> ball

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
how long it takes for the ping pong ball

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.030 
how long it takes for the ping pong ball
launcher<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:20.140> be<00:00:20.260> launched<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.650> then<00:00:20.770> hit<00:00:20.920> the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
launcher to be launched and then hit the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.859 
launcher to be launched and then hit the
ground<00:00:21.220> what<00:00:21.970> that's<00:00:22.150> going<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.390> give<00:00:22.599> us<00:00:22.630> is

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
ground what that's going to give us is

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.240 
ground what that's going to give us is
going<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.110> give<00:00:23.230> us<00:00:23.260> t<00:00:23.619> know<00:00:23.830> that<00:00:23.950> equation

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
going to give us t know that equation

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to give us t know that equation
that<00:00:24.460> we<00:00:24.580> use<00:00:24.760> for<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:25.029> height<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:26.470> know<00:00:26.650> what

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
that we use for the height we know what

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.410 
that we use for the height we know what
the<00:00:26.920> initial<00:00:27.340> height<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.670> we<00:00:28.029> know<00:00:28.180> what<00:00:28.330> the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
the initial height is we know what the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.019 
the initial height is we know what the
final<00:00:28.689> height<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.140> we<00:00:29.800> know<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.099> that<00:00:30.220> we<00:00:30.850> know

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
final height is we know is that we know

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.630 
final height is we know is that we know
acceleration<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.869> going<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.050> be<00:00:32.169> right<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.520> the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
acceleration is going to be right so the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.100 
acceleration is going to be right so the
only<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:34.150> we<00:00:34.239> don't<00:00:34.390> know<00:00:34.600> our<00:00:34.629> initial

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
only that we don't know our initial

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.119 
only that we don't know our initial
velocity<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.800> we<00:00:35.949> don't<00:00:36.160> know<00:00:36.430> time<00:00:37.260> okay<00:00:38.260> so

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
velocity and we don't know time okay so

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.650 
velocity and we don't know time okay so
we<00:00:39.250> can't<00:00:39.519> solve<00:00:39.820> that<00:00:39.970> if<00:00:40.120> we<00:00:40.239> don't<00:00:40.420> if<00:00:40.600> we

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
we can't solve that if we don't if we

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.020 
we can't solve that if we don't if we
have<00:00:40.840> two<00:00:41.050> unknowns<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:42.430> if<00:00:42.550> we<00:00:42.730> calculate

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
have two unknowns well if we calculate

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.049 
have two unknowns well if we calculate
if<00:00:43.570> we<00:00:43.809> time<00:00:44.440> how<00:00:44.890> long<00:00:44.949> it<00:00:45.129> takes<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.519> go<00:00:45.670> in

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
if we time how long it takes to go in

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.209 
if we time how long it takes to go in
the<00:00:46.330> air<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.660> come<00:00:46.840> back<00:00:46.960> down<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.890> gives<00:00:48.100> us

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
the air and come back down that gives us

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.490 
the air and come back down that gives us
time<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:48.910> we<00:00:49.030> can<00:00:49.180> put<00:00:49.899> that<00:00:50.110> back<00:00:50.290> in

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
time and then we can put that back in

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.870 
time and then we can put that back in
and<00:00:50.680> solve<00:00:50.829> for<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.070> initial<00:00:51.280> velocity<00:00:51.790> does

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
and solve for the initial velocity does

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.400 
and solve for the initial velocity does
that<00:00:52.000> make<00:00:52.120> sense<00:00:52.149> because<00:00:53.020> that'll<00:00:53.230> be<00:00:53.320> our

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
that make sense because that'll be our

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.979 
that make sense because that'll be our
only<00:00:53.590> unknown<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.210> each<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.660> groups<00:00:55.870> is

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
only unknown so each of the groups is

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.930 
only unknown so each of the groups is
going<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.379> calculate<00:00:56.620> our<00:00:56.950> time<00:00:57.340> how

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
going to have to calculate our time how

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.400 
going to have to calculate our time how
long<00:00:57.969> it<00:00:58.149> takes<00:00:58.270> for<00:00:58.540> their<00:00:58.690> ping-pong<00:00:59.050> ball

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
long it takes for their ping-pong ball

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:14.120 
long it takes for their ping-pong ball
or<00:00:59.530> just<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.829> go<00:00:59.950> up<00:01:00.100> back<00:01:00.700> down

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.370 

each<00:01:15.130> whatever<00:01:15.490> should<00:01:15.730> be<00:01:15.850> able<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.380> adjust

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
each whatever should be able to adjust

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.560 
each whatever should be able to adjust
the<00:01:17.440> angle<00:01:17.620> at<00:01:17.860> lunch<00:01:18.040> yeah<00:01:18.400> from<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.180> mounted

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
the angle at lunch yeah from the mounted

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.570 
the angle at lunch yeah from the mounted
position<00:01:19.720> yeah<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.710> then<00:01:20.860> from<00:01:21.100> there<00:01:21.340> they

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
position yeah and then from there they

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.980 
position yeah and then from there they
calculate<00:01:22.090> what<00:01:22.300> angle<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:22.660> they<00:01:22.780> launched

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
calculate what angle that they launched

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.950 
calculate what angle that they launched
that<00:01:23.230> in<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:24.550> paper<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:25.120> front<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.420> me<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.720> then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
that in on paper in front of me and then

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.420 
that in on paper in front of me and then
let<00:01:26.740> me<00:01:26.830> shoot<00:01:27.330> adopted<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.510> target<00:01:28.840> come<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
let me shoot adopted the target come and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.680 
let me shoot adopted the target come and
they're<00:01:30.580> gonna<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.850> grated<00:01:31.120> based<00:01:31.330> on<00:01:31.510> their

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
they're gonna get grated based on their

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.240 
they're gonna get grated based on their
calculations<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.470> then<00:01:32.590> how<00:01:32.740> close<00:01:33.040> they

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
calculations and then how close they

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.680 
calculations and then how close they
actually<00:01:33.550> yeah<00:01:33.670> they're<00:01:34.090> both<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.510> those<00:01:34.600> ends

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
actually yeah they're both of those ends

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.240 
actually yeah they're both of those ends
so<00:01:37.690> I<00:01:37.750> went<00:01:37.900> through<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.920> different

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
so I went through the different

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.070 
so I went through the different
accelerated<00:01:40.060> motion<00:01:40.210> equations<00:01:40.450> with<00:01:40.930> them

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
accelerated motion equations with them

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.370 
accelerated motion equations with them
and<00:01:42.030> spend<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.150> day<00:01:43.330> just<00:01:43.570> doing<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.290> know

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
and spend a day just doing you know

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.340 
and spend a day just doing you know
basic<00:01:44.770> kind<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.160> generic<00:01:46.050> yeah<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.230> then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
basic kind of generic yeah and then

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.260 
basic kind of generic yeah and then
we've<00:01:47.470> tied<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.890> into<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.280> ping<00:01:48.700> pong<00:01:48.730> ball<00:01:48.910> on

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
we've tied it into the ping pong ball on

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.760 
we've tied it into the ping pong ball on
Cheers

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
Cheers

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.770 
Cheers
and<00:01:50.890> then<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.460> had<00:01:51.850> them<00:01:52.090> come<00:01:52.359> up<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.659> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and then I had them come up with the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.990 
and then I had them come up with the
question<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.920> can't<00:01:54.369> finish<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.820> out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
question that we can't finish it out

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.219 
question that we can't finish it out
because<00:01:55.329> we<00:01:55.420> don't<00:01:55.600> know<00:01:55.719> where<00:01:55.869> initial

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
because we don't know where initial

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.660 
because we don't know where initial
velocity<00:01:56.619> was<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:56.950> we<00:01:57.100> had<00:01:57.219> that<00:01:57.369> conversation

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
velocity was so we had that conversation

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.609 
velocity was so we had that conversation
about<00:01:58.149> how<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.659> could<00:01:58.899> calculate<00:01:59.049> initial

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
about how we could calculate initial

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.410 
about how we could calculate initial
velocity<00:02:00.009> Anna<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.670> decided<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.179> can<00:02:01.299> get

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
velocity Anna and decided we can get

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.719 
velocity Anna and decided we can get
going<00:02:01.539> out<00:02:01.719> in<00:02:01.840> time<00:02:02.350> Tanner<00:02:03.009> ping-pong<00:02:03.490> balls

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
going out in time Tanner ping-pong balls

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.990 
going out in time Tanner ping-pong balls
for<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.299> most<00:02:04.479> part<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:05.350> students

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
for the most part the students

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.580 
for the most part the students
understood<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.420> importance<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.049> calculating

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
understood the importance of calculating

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.100 
understood the importance of calculating
time<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:10.179> pouring<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.599> project<00:02:10.989> and

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
time and then pouring to the project and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.600 
time and then pouring to the project and
being<00:02:11.620> able<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.980> aim<00:02:12.430> at<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> target

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.510 

I<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:16.450> had<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:17.080> jumped

really inspired me to just even if you
don't<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.460> what<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> outcome<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
don't know what the outcome is going to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.670 
don't know what the outcome is going to
be<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.540> child<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.140> wanted<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.470> build<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
sailboat and so so we went for it and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.430 
sailboat and so so we went for it and
there<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.150> wasn't<00:02:33.330> enough<00:02:33.630> time<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.290> they

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
there just wasn't enough time but they

there just wasn't enough time but they
wanted<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> even<00:02:35.460> though<00:02:36.350> there<00:02:37.350> are

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
wanted to do it even though there are

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.510 
wanted to do it even though there are
people<00:02:37.680> saying<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.950> don't<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.310> do

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
people saying I don't know if we can do

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.250 
people saying I don't know if we can do
it<00:02:38.550> let's<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.270> go<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.570> we<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.020> think

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it let's just go I think we can I think

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560 
it let's just go I think we can I think
we<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.830> see<00:02:41.610> he'd<00:02:42.000> never<00:02:42.180> done<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
we can just see he'd never done that

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.260 
we can just see he'd never done that
with<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.810> group<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.080> students<00:02:43.350> before<00:02:43.470> right

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
it and said you know it's okay if I

don't<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.870> all<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.110> answers<00:03:20.140> we're<00:03:20.560> going

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
don't have all the answers we're going

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.890 
don't have all the answers we're going
to<00:03:20.770> find<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.490> answers<00:03:21.760> together<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.780> we

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
to find the answers together and we

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.630 
to find the answers together and we
started<00:03:23.170> working<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.710> one<00:03:23.800> at<00:03:24.100> lunch<00:03:24.340> I

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
started working one on one at lunch I

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.580 
started working one on one at lunch I
think<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.300> would<00:03:25.450> challenge<00:03:25.870> each<00:03:26.200> other<00:03:26.320> he

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
think we would challenge each other he

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.200 
think we would challenge each other he
would<00:03:26.740> bring<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.980> question<00:03:27.640> for<00:03:27.790> me<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.030> try<00:03:28.180> to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
would bring a question for me to try to

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.000 
would bring a question for me to try to
challenge<00:03:28.510> me<00:03:28.780> yeah<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.710> would<00:03:29.860> try<00:03:29.980> to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
challenge me yeah and I would try to

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.590 
challenge me yeah and I would try to
challenge<00:03:30.280> him<00:03:30.580> with<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.790> question<00:03:31.120> well

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
challenge him with the question well

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.110 
challenge him with the question well
that's<00:03:32.020> how<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.350> we<00:03:33.070> that's<00:03:33.880> how<00:03:34.000> he<00:03:34.090> learned

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
that's how so we that's how he learned

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000 
that's how so we that's how he learned
basically<00:03:34.810> for<00:03:34.990> two<00:03:35.110> years<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.860> was

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
basically for two years that was

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.320 
basically for two years that was
probably<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.400> big<00:03:36.550> learning<00:03:36.700> experience<00:03:36.940> for

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
probably a big learning experience for

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.840 
probably a big learning experience for
just<00:03:37.750> yeah<00:03:37.960> I'm<00:03:38.590> okay<00:03:39.010> with<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.580> don't<00:03:39.730> have

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
just yeah I'm okay with it I don't have

just yeah I'm okay with it I don't have
the<00:03:39.940> answers<00:03:40.210> on<00:03:40.330> what<00:03:40.420> cable

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the answers on what cable

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.590 
the answers on what cable
we're<00:03:40.939> learning<00:03:41.060> together<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.810> that's<00:03:42.049> cool
