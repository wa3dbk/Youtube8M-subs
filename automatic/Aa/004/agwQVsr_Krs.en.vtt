00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
into the review so not surprisingly

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.740 
into the review so not surprisingly
enough<00:00:44.130> I<00:00:44.370> bought<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> product<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.210> Target

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
enough I bought this product from Target

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.319 
enough I bought this product from Target
and<00:00:45.900> I<00:00:46.290> paid<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.740> six<00:00:47.280> dollars<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and I paid about six dollars for it so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
and I paid about six dollars for it so
it's<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.630> of<00:00:48.720> elf's<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.380> expensive

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's one of elf's more expensive

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's one of elf's more expensive
products<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.670> sell<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.240> it's<00:00:51.810> totally

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
products that they sell but it's totally

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.110 
products that they sell but it's totally
worth<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.250> worry<00:00:53.400> about<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
worth it so don't worry about it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.410 
worth it so don't worry about it
it<00:00:54.600> comes<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.960> 0.49<00:00:55.860> ounces<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.790> it's<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it comes with 0.49 ounces and it's a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900 
it comes with 0.49 ounces and it's a
little<00:00:57.780> bit<00:00:58.020> deceiving<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.700> looks

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
little bit deceiving because it looks

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.030 
little bit deceiving because it looks
like<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.630> product<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
like you would get product all in this

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.280 
like you would get product all in this
bottle<00:01:02.430> except<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.630> have<00:01:03.810> this<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bottle except they have this little

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840 
bottle except they have this little
plastic<00:01:04.559> thing<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> bottom<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:05.759> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
plastic thing in the bottom and it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
plastic thing in the bottom and it's
pushed<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.540> halfway<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:07.110> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pushed up about halfway through so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
pushed up about halfway through so
you're<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.610> getting<00:01:08.940> half<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.750> what

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you're really only getting half of what

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
you're really only getting half of what
it<00:01:10.800> looks<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.600> bit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it looks like which is a little bit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
it looks like which is a little bit
disappointing<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.040> found<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
disappointing but I found out that you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 
disappointing but I found out that you
only<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.150> need<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> pea-sized<00:01:16.560> amount

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
only really need like a pea-sized amount

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
only really need like a pea-sized amount
to<00:01:17.640> cover<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.180> entire<00:01:18.330> face<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.440> little

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
to cover your entire face so a little

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
to cover your entire face so a little
bit<00:01:19.860> goes<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.220> way<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> should<00:01:20.850> last

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
bit goes a long way and it should last

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
bit goes a long way and it should last
you<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.659> long<00:01:21.870> while<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.620> guess<00:01:23.190> if<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> were

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you a good long while I guess if I were

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
you a good long while I guess if I were
to<00:01:24.090> compare<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.870> primer<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.860> another<00:01:26.280> more

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to compare this primer to another more

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
to compare this primer to another more
expensive<00:01:27.030> primer<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.450> would<00:01:27.750> compare<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
expensive primer I would compare it to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.240 
expensive primer I would compare it to
the<00:01:28.470> Smashbox<00:01:29.130> photo-finish<00:01:30.770> except<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the Smashbox photo-finish except at the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
the Smashbox photo-finish except at the
same<00:01:32.460> time<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.240> compare

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
same time they don't really compare

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
same time they don't really compare
because<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.920> six<00:01:35.280> dollars<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
because this is six dollars and the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.859 
because this is six dollars and the
Smashbox<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.229> 40<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.690> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
Smashbox is like 40 so I think that this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.620 
Smashbox is like 40 so I think that this
for<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> price<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.330> as<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
for the price is just as good as that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.390 
for the price is just as good as that
I've<00:01:42.930> tried<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> bought<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> little

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
I've tried it before I bought a little

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.660 
I've tried it before I bought a little
travel<00:01:44.940> size<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.260> worked<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
travel size and it worked for me but

travel size and it worked for me but
this<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.080> six<00:01:49.350> times<00:01:49.619> cheaper<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

mention that this primer doesn't break

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.730 
mention that this primer doesn't break
me<00:05:24.729> out<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.210> know<00:05:25.479> that<00:05:25.690> that's<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.110> big<00:05:26.259> concern

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
me out I know that that's a big concern

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.550 
me out I know that that's a big concern
when<00:05:26.979> trying<00:05:27.340> new<00:05:27.639> facial<00:05:28.210> products<00:05:28.659> but<00:05:29.319> I

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
when trying new facial products but I

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.260 
when trying new facial products but I
really<00:05:29.919> sensitive<00:05:30.310> skin<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.849> if<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.090> doesn't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
really sensitive skin and if it doesn't

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.269 
really sensitive skin and if it doesn't
break<00:05:31.539> me<00:05:31.840> out<00:05:31.990> then<00:05:32.289> I<00:05:32.319> think<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.740> you'll<00:05:32.919> be

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
break me out then I think that you'll be

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.839 
break me out then I think that you'll be
