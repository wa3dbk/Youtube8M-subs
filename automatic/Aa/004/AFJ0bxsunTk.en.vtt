the cheapest ingredients in first so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
the cheapest ingredients in first so
again<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:36.960> I've<00:00:37.079> got<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> I've<00:00:37.680> got

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
again what I've got here is I've got

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.110 
again what I've got here is I've got
some<00:00:37.920> castor<00:00:38.430> sugar<00:00:38.460> we're<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> be

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
some castor sugar we're going to be

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.000 
some castor sugar we're going to be
using<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.629> bar<00:00:39.840> spoons<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> castor<00:00:40.710> sugar

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.229 

what<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.370> does<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> adds<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
what I think that does is it adds a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
what I think that does is it adds a
really<00:00:48.420> lovely<00:00:48.780> effervescent<00:00:49.500> sort<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really lovely effervescent sort of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
really lovely effervescent sort of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
little sherbert character to the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
little sherbert character to the
daiquiri<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> add

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
daiquiri and to that we're going to add

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
daiquiri and to that we're going to add
one<00:00:54.329> measure<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> lime<00:00:54.840> juice<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
one measure of lime juice we're just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
one measure of lime juice we're just
going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.219> our<00:00:56.370> Mexican<00:00:56.760> elbow<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.210> we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
going to use our Mexican elbow but we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
going to use our Mexican elbow but we
are<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> measure<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.410> ensure

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
are going to measure it just to ensure

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
are going to measure it just to ensure
consistency<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.879> I've<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.239> pre-cut

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
consistency so I've got some pre-cut

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
consistency so I've got some pre-cut
limes<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> place<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> our

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.679 
limes here I'm going to place it in our
Mexican<00:01:02.399> elbow<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.940> squeeze<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:08.689> make

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Mexican elbow and just squeeze in make

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
Mexican elbow and just squeeze in make
sure<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> full<00:01:10.409> shot<00:01:16.880> now<00:01:17.880> we're<00:01:18.090> going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
sure we have a full shot now we're going

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
sure we have a full shot now we're going
to<00:01:18.240> dissolve<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.290> castor<00:01:19.770> sugar<00:01:19.799> until

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to dissolve the castor sugar until

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
to dissolve the castor sugar until
measure<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.210> lime<00:01:21.420> juice<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.900> room

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
measure of lime juice at room

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.749 
measure of lime juice at room
temperature<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> happen

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
temperature so this is going to happen

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
temperature so this is going to happen
much<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.210> quicker<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> rush<00:01:25.650> by

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.420 
now we need to add ice and shake this
and<00:02:00.350> get<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.620> cold<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:00.950> quickly<00:02:01.220> as

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
and get it as cold as quickly as

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.529 
and get it as cold as quickly as
possible<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:07.610> fill<00:02:07.790> our<00:02:07.880> mixing<00:02:08.149> glass<00:02:08.179> always

replace your mixing glass to one side

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.400 
replace your mixing glass to one side
but<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:35.570> I'm<00:02:35.630> going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.780> discard<00:02:36.170> our

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
down I'm going to put our index finger

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.000 
down I'm going to put our index finger
on<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.030> lip<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.390> wrap<00:02:44.570> our<00:02:44.720> hand<00:02:44.930> round<00:02:45.080> we're

going to double strain this one because

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.120 
going to double strain this one because
during<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> shaking<00:02:48.050> process<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.770> break<00:02:48.950> off

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
during the shaking process you break off

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:59.740 
during the shaking process you break off
little<00:02:49.250> ice<00:02:49.550> crystals<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:59.300> need<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.570> tidy

little ice crystals you need to tidy

little ice crystals you need to tidy
everything<00:02:59.900> up<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:00.980> out<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
everything up and just get it out of the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.229 
everything up and just get it out of the
way<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.400> quickly<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:02.000> possible<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.910> believe

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
way as quickly as possible now I believe

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.550 
way as quickly as possible now I believe
the<00:03:05.420> decorate<00:03:05.780> should<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.019> served<00:03:06.260> without<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the decorate should be served without a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.320 
the decorate should be served without a
garnish<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.190> lot<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.519> people<00:03:07.760> put<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> lime<00:03:08.150> wedge

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
garnish a lot of people put a lime wedge

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.210 
garnish a lot of people put a lime wedge
on<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.630> side<00:03:08.870> or<00:03:09.080> perhaps<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.530> lime<00:03:09.709> wheel<00:03:09.980> but

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
on the side or perhaps a lime wheel but

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.039 
on the side or perhaps a lime wheel but
I<00:03:10.280> think<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.880> attracts<00:03:11.480> on<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.690> freshness

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
I think that attracts on the freshness

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.840 
I think that attracts on the freshness
and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> vibrancy<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:13.370> particular

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
and the vibrancy of this particular

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:29.030 
and the vibrancy of this particular
drink<00:03:17.440> now<00:03:18.440> we<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.769> one<00:03:19.220> daiquiri
