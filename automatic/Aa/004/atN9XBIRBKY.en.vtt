00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
those were arranged it fires you could
buy<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.740> molten<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.310> maybe<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.570> doing

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

think if the blizzards decides to buff

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
think if the blizzards decides to buff
the<00:01:46.860> range<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.939> some<00:01:48.540> future

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the range of it a bit in some future

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.469 
the range of it a bit in some future
patches<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.470> might<00:01:49.770> actually<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.189> a

know<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:27.930> isn't<00:02:28.440> viable<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:29.430> bad

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
know this is just isn't viable it's bad

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700 
know this is just isn't viable it's bad
and<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.600> running<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> freakin<00:02:31.500> power

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and this running of the freakin power

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.280 
and this running of the freakin power
well<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.970> be<00:02:33.000> worked<00:02:33.690> around<00:02:33.900> somehow

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
well that can be worked around somehow

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.580 
well that can be worked around somehow
but<00:02:37.130> probably<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:39.060> anytime<00:02:39.300> soon<00:02:39.590> unless

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but probably not anytime soon unless

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.640 
but probably not anytime soon unless
buzzer<00:02:41.460> decides<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.150> above<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> range<00:02:42.810> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
buzzer decides to above the range it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.080 
buzzer decides to above the range it's
gonna<00:02:43.830> use<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:47.270> next<00:02:48.270> thing<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.570> tried<00:02:48.980> was

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
gonna use this so next thing I tried was

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.540 
gonna use this so next thing I tried was
the<00:02:51.090> meteor<00:02:51.450> build<00:02:51.690> now<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.100> meteor<00:02:53.370> bad

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the meteor build now the meteor bad

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.950 
the meteor build now the meteor bad
surprisingly<00:02:54.180> works<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:57.330> why<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.630> use<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
surprisingly works so why not use it

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.230 
surprisingly works so why not use it
well<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:59.010> kinda<00:02:59.280> unreliable<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:02.240> its

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
well it's kinda unreliable and its

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.290 
well it's kinda unreliable and its
really<00:03:03.450> slow<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.260> clearing<00:03:04.650> trash<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
really slow for clearing trash it's it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.030 
really slow for clearing trash it's it
is<00:03:06.450> sort<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.990> good<00:03:07.200> results<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.770> killing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
is sort of good results on killing

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.060 
is sort of good results on killing
bosses<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.090> even<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.690> slow<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.740> isn't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
bosses it's not even that slow it isn't

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.670 
bosses it's not even that slow it isn't
the<00:03:11.130> fastest<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.570> isn't<00:03:12.870> that's<00:03:13.080> let's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the fastest but it isn't that's let's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.830 
the fastest but it isn't that's let's
know<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:15.530> yeah<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.330> just<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.630> a

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
know but yeah it's just it's just in a

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.540 
know but yeah it's just it's just in a
mobile<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:21.240> kind<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.540> crappy<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.230> I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
mobile it's it's kind of crappy really I

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.030 
mobile it's it's kind of crappy really I
suggest<00:03:23.550> not<00:03:23.670> using<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.800> maybe<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:25.890> going

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
suggest not using that maybe I'm going

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.330 
suggest not using that maybe I'm going
to<00:03:26.100> figure<00:03:26.310> something<00:03:26.550> else<00:03:26.730> later<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:28.020> but<00:03:28.340> so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
to figure something else later on but so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.090 
to figure something else later on but so
far<00:03:30.140> especially<00:03:31.140> if<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.770> single

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
far especially if you get a single

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.230 
far especially if you get a single
target<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.550> you're<00:03:32.700> going<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.940> go<00:03:33.060> crazy

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
target that you're going to go crazy

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.140 
target that you're going to go crazy
with<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.690> meteorites<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:35.610> gauge<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.880> to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
with the meteorites the gauge is to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.970 
with the meteorites the gauge is to
recharge<00:03:36.540> Alice<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.230> get<00:03:37.350> super<00:03:37.620> lock<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.860> in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
recharge Alice you get super lock you in

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.720 
recharge Alice you get super lock you in

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
place and just kept spamming and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.840 
place and just kept spamming and
spamming<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.210> panic<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.040> yeah<00:03:56.040> meter<00:03:56.580> works

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
spamming and panic so yeah meter works

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.240 
spamming and panic so yeah meter works
it's<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:58.410> not<00:03:58.650> nothing<00:03:59.160> right<00:03:59.490> but<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.000> works

it's it's not nothing right but it works
but<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:04.140> really<00:04:04.800> bad<00:04:04.950> for<00:04:05.310> clearing<00:04:06.090> trash

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
but it's really bad for clearing trash

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.930 
but it's really bad for clearing trash
it<00:04:06.770> is<00:04:07.770> quite<00:04:08.070> good<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.459> killing<00:04:08.730> champ

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
impacts on another there something like

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.810 
impacts on another there something like
those<00:04:11.130> gold<00:04:11.640> casters<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:14.070> kind<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:14.610> slow

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
those gold casters but it's kind of slow

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.960 
those gold casters but it's kind of slow
and<00:04:15.200> sort<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.230> an<00:04:16.410> Undine<00:04:17.010> amick<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.549> don't

survivability<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.620> quite<00:04:35.160> nice<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.730> have<00:04:36.600> to

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
survivability is quite nice I have to

survivability is quite nice I have to
admit<00:04:37.790> so<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:39.300> slap<00:04:39.930> some<00:04:40.170> other<00:04:40.490> crazy

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
Dimitra bility there so that obviously

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.980 
Dimitra bility there so that obviously
works<00:04:45.690> but<00:04:46.610> yeah<00:04:47.610> again<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.420> problem<00:04:48.750> it

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
works but yeah again the problem it

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.390 
works but yeah again the problem it
doesn't<00:04:49.050> go<00:04:49.440> anywhere<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:49.980> stays<00:04:50.220> in<00:04:50.370> one

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
doesn't go anywhere just stays in one

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.830 
doesn't go anywhere just stays in one
place<00:04:50.840> it's<00:04:51.840> poking<00:04:52.830> quite<00:04:53.040> nice<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:54.090> don't

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
place it's poking quite nice so don't

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.360
