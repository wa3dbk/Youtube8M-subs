00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
anything that hasn't been done I think

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.510 
anything that hasn't been done I think
what<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.289> all<00:01:23.409> try<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.710> do<00:01:23.859> is<00:01:24.039> either<00:01:24.189> tweak

percentages what we think is gonna be
give<00:03:37.420> us<00:03:37.540> our<00:03:37.690> best<00:03:37.930> opportunity<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.380> be

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
little doubt in your mind what if they

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.960 
little doubt in your mind what if they
do<00:03:42.519> this<00:03:43.350> with<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.650> much<00:03:44.860> complexity<00:03:45.640> that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
do this with so much complexity that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.420 
do this with so much complexity that
goes<00:03:46.150> well<00:03:46.510> beyond<00:03:46.930> blocking<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.769> tackling

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
goes well beyond blocking and tackling

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.910 
goes well beyond blocking and tackling
how<00:03:49.150> do<00:03:49.209> those<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.780> teach<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.260> for<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> living

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
how do those that teach it for a living

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460 
how do those that teach it for a living
some<00:03:51.550> up<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.820> game<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.239> has<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.420> reputation<00:03:52.870> for

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
some up a game that has a reputation for

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.100 
some up a game that has a reputation for
being<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.340> violent<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.060> physically<00:03:55.750> oriented

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
being so violent and physically oriented

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.430 
being so violent and physically oriented
I<00:03:57.330> think<00:03:58.330> there's<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.540> misconception<00:03:58.780> as<00:03:59.410> a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
I think there's a misconception as a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.009 
I think there's a misconception as a
bunch<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.769> rock<00:03:59.920> kids<00:04:00.160> go<00:04:00.340> around<00:04:01.019> banging

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
bunch of rock kids go around banging

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.920 
bunch of rock kids go around banging
each<00:04:02.230> other<00:04:02.410> up<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.430> reality<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.780> is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
each other up but the reality is it is

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.960 
each other up but the reality is it is
it<00:04:05.170> is<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.320> game<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.830> for<00:04:06.160> game<00:04:06.340> planning<00:04:06.640> and

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
it is a game for for game planning and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.420 
it is a game for for game planning and
and<00:04:07.150> strategy<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.290> all<00:04:08.380> those<00:04:08.560> things<00:04:08.890> and

and strategy and all those things and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:19.449 
and strategy and all those things and
it's<00:04:09.610> definitely<00:04:09.880> not<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.209> game<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.720> dumb<00:04:10.840> guys
