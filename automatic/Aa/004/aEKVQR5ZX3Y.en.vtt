me where I'll switch brushes I'll do
like<00:06:07.820> a<00:06:07.880> d9<00:06:08.390> itself<00:06:08.900> is<00:06:08.990> be<00:06:09.080> 41<00:06:09.470> brush<00:06:09.890> which

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
like a d9 itself is be 41 brush which

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.160 
like a d9 itself is be 41 brush which
has<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:11.060> tip<00:06:11.270> of<00:06:11.390> actually<00:06:11.690> closer<00:06:11.900> together

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
has the tip of actually closer together

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.590 
has the tip of actually closer together
and<00:06:12.590> it<00:06:13.040> will<00:06:13.100> force<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.640> curls<00:06:13.910> on<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.330> clump

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
and it will force the curls on the clump

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.410 
and it will force the curls on the clump
together<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:15.050> little<00:06:15.260> bit<00:06:15.350> more<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:16.520> yes<00:06:17.120> I

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
that in terms of drying of the hair I

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.070

how's the fire go outside this encased
humidity<00:06:33.490> to<00:06:34.490> it<00:06:34.610> outside

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
humidity to it outside

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.530 
humidity to it outside
humidity<00:06:35.480> completes<00:06:36.260> it<00:06:36.800> like<00:06:37.190> kind<00:06:37.640> of<00:06:37.700> lock

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
humidity completes it like kind of lock

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.450 
humidity completes it like kind of lock
them<00:06:38.720> together<00:06:38.900> as<00:06:39.380> its<00:06:39.620> drying<00:06:40.010> so<00:06:40.310> I<00:06:40.340> never

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
them together as its drying so I never

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.280 
them together as its drying so I never
like<00:06:40.760> go<00:06:40.910> outside<00:06:41.060> as<00:06:41.330> my<00:06:41.480> hair<00:06:41.690> I'm<00:06:41.840> gonna<00:06:42.020> dry
