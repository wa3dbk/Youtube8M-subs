00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's a very thin brush the bristles are
like<00:00:59.760> they're<00:01:00.390> plastic<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.379> spiky

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
like they're plastic little spiky

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600 
like they're plastic little spiky
bristles<00:01:02.370> um<00:01:03.019> actually<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.979> brush<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
bristles um actually like the brush and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
bristles um actually like the brush and
little<00:01:06.210> Swiper<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> bottle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little Swiper that's on the bottle

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
little Swiper that's on the bottle
because<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.670> pull<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.780> doesn't

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
because you pull it out it doesn't

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
because you pull it out it doesn't
deposit<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> ton<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> product<00:01:11.880> onto<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> brush

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
deposit a ton of product onto the brush

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
deposit a ton of product onto the brush
there's<00:01:12.960> no<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.560> product<00:01:14.070> buildup<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there's no like product buildup which is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
there's no like product buildup which is
great<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.299> usually<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.080> swipe

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
great because usually have to like swipe

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.810 
great because usually have to like swipe
it<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.570> stock<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> bottle<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:20.189> did

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it down stock into the bottle I did

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.719 
it down stock into the bottle I did
notice<00:01:21.030> however<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> wand<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.770> little

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
notice however that the wand is a little

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.570 
notice however that the wand is a little
flimsy<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.930> guess<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.530> could<00:01:25.590> say<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
flimsy I guess you could say it's it's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
flimsy I guess you could say it's it's
really<00:01:26.790> light<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.560> brush

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
really light and you can see the brush

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.670 
really light and you can see the brush
is<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.790> bendy<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
is very very bendy and I think the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.160 
is very very bendy and I think the
reason<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> being<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
reason for that being that when you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630 
reason for that being that when you
actually<00:01:34.350> activate<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> vibration<00:01:35.490> by

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
actually activate the vibration by

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
actually activate the vibration by
pressing<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.180> button<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
pressing a little button which you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
pressing a little button which you
probably<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.549> pressing<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
probably will see but I'm pressing it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.130 
probably will see but I'm pressing it
now<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.240> hear<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:42.689> um<00:01:45.140> yeah

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
now but you can hear it I'm sure um yeah

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
now but you can hear it I'm sure um yeah
the<00:01:46.560> reason<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> when<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> do

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the reason for that is that when you do

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.940 
the reason for that is that when you do
activate<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.259> light<00:01:49.500> enough<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
activate it it is light enough so that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.030 
activate it it is light enough so that
it<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.340> respond<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.600> vibrate

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
it will respond and it will vibrate

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
it will respond and it will vibrate
though<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> can't<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> vibrating

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
though you can't really see it vibrating

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.260 
though you can't really see it vibrating
um<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.979> feel<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> definitely<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
um you can feel it definitely when you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.179 
um you can feel it definitely when you
when<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.630> apply<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.469> lashes<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
when you apply it to your lashes I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
when you apply it to your lashes I
really<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.180> mascara<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.869> found<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really like this mascara I found that it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
really like this mascara I found that it
didn't<00:02:02.219> clump<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.880> didn't<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.329> any<00:02:03.509> problems

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
didn't clump I didn't have any problems

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
didn't clump I didn't have any problems
with<00:02:03.930> clumping<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.829> um<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.880> went

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
with clumping with this um it went

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.330 
with clumping with this um it went
through<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.420> lashes<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.170> nicely<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
through my lashes really nicely and this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
through my lashes really nicely and this
is<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> water<00:02:08.729> content<00:02:09.090> whoops<00:02:09.420> sorry<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is the water content whoops sorry so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.280 
is the water content whoops sorry so
held<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.800> curl<00:02:11.099> really<00:02:11.489> well<00:02:11.760> um

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
held my curl really well um

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.020 
held my curl really well um
I<00:02:13.379> didn't<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.280> helped<00:02:14.549> actually

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I didn't see that it helped actually

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.449 
I didn't see that it helped actually
curl<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.719> it<00:02:15.810> did<00:02:16.019> hold<00:02:16.409> my<00:02:16.680> curl<00:02:16.920> when<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.159> did

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
curl but it did hold my curl when I did

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.470 
curl but it did hold my curl when I did
curl<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.939> with<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> eyelash<00:02:18.450> curler<00:02:18.870> um<00:02:20.359> so<00:02:21.359> yeah

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
curl it with a eyelash curler um so yeah

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.500 
curl it with a eyelash curler um so yeah
I<00:02:21.569> think<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:22.799> good<00:02:22.920> mascara<00:02:23.310> i<00:02:23.819> did

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I think it's a really good mascara i did

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.140 
I think it's a really good mascara i did
use<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.989> with<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.590> without<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.150> vibration

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
use it with and without the vibration

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.869 
use it with and without the vibration
just<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> differences<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.609> if

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
just to see the differences to see if

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.670 
just to see the differences to see if
maybe<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.390> was<00:02:30.569> just<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.810> formula<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
maybe it was just the formula that I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.380 
maybe it was just the formula that I
really<00:02:31.980> liked<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.489> if<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> vibration<00:02:33.269> was

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
really liked or if the vibration was

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.530 
really liked or if the vibration was
actually<00:02:33.750> doing<00:02:34.140> something<00:02:34.409> extra<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
actually doing something extra and the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.390 
actually doing something extra and the
main<00:02:36.750> reason<00:02:37.349> or<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.590> main<00:02:37.890> difference

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
main reason or the main difference

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.460 
main reason or the main difference
rather<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.120> saw<00:02:39.420> between<00:02:39.629> using<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.319> with

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
rather that I saw between using it with

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800 
rather that I saw between using it with
and<00:02:40.650> without<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.189> that<00:02:41.879> with<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.299> vibration

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and without is that with the vibration

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.069 
and without is that with the vibration
it<00:02:43.049> went<00:02:43.290> through<00:02:43.530> my<00:02:43.650> lashes<00:02:43.889> a<00:02:44.099> lot<00:02:44.430> easier

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
it went through my lashes a lot easier

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.740 
it went through my lashes a lot easier
and<00:02:46.079> quicker<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.639> also<00:02:47.819> coated<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.510> very

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and quicker and it also coated the very

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.220 
and quicker and it also coated the very
tips<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.409> a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.739> better<00:02:50.840> without<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
tips of it a lot better without the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.659 
tips of it a lot better without the
vibration<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.739> had<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.099> hold<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.519> brush

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
vibration I had to like hold the brush

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:54.920 
vibration I had to like hold the brush
at<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.970> tips<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.329> kind<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.540> wiggle<00:02:54.689> it<00:02:54.870> back

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
at the tips and kind of wiggle it back

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.479 
at the tips and kind of wiggle it back
and<00:02:55.200> forth<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:55.620> make<00:02:55.739> sure<00:02:55.889> it<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.099> completely

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and forth to make sure it was completely

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.699 
and forth to make sure it was completely
coated<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.389> other<00:02:57.510> than<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.230> pretty

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
coated but other than that like pretty

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.960 
coated but other than that like pretty
much<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.220> same<00:02:59.400> effect<00:02:59.689> um<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:00.950> would<00:03:01.970> describe

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
much the same effect um I would describe

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.970 
much the same effect um I would describe
this<00:03:03.269> mascara<00:03:03.659> as<00:03:03.870> more<00:03:04.139> of<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.439> lengthening

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
this mascara as more of a lengthening

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.159 
this mascara as more of a lengthening
mascara<00:03:05.099> as<00:03:05.579> opposed<00:03:05.939> to<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.359> volumizing

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
mascara as opposed to a volumizing

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.920 
mascara as opposed to a volumizing
mascara<00:03:07.669> it<00:03:08.669> does<00:03:08.849> give<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.209> some<00:03:09.419> volume<00:03:09.750> I'm

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
mascara it does give you some volume I'm

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.349 
mascara it does give you some volume I'm
wearing<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.409> right<00:03:10.439> now<00:03:10.650> not<00:03:11.159> know<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.549> my

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
wearing it right now not know if my

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.610 
wearing it right now not know if my
camera<00:03:12.629> was<00:03:12.689> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> pick<00:03:13.049> up<00:03:13.139> on<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.379> or

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
camera was going to pick up on it or

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.050 
camera was going to pick up on it or
focus<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.250> I'm<00:03:14.310> learning<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.549> now<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
focus but I'm learning it now and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.890 
focus but I'm learning it now and
actually<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.569> how<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.859> looks<00:03:17.189> um<00:03:17.900> definitely

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
actually like how it looks um definitely

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.920 
actually like how it looks um definitely
I<00:03:19.139> find<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.829> does<00:03:20.040> give<00:03:20.250> me<00:03:20.459> um<00:03:20.930> more

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
I find that it does give me um more

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.809 
I find that it does give me um more
length<00:03:22.229> or<00:03:22.409> it<00:03:22.500> emphasizes<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.310> length<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.639> my

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
length or it emphasizes the length of my

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.610 
length or it emphasizes the length of my
lashes<00:03:24.060> more<00:03:24.479> than<00:03:24.659> actually<00:03:25.169> giving<00:03:25.470> me

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
lashes more than actually giving me

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500 
lashes more than actually giving me
volume<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.310> does<00:03:26.459> give<00:03:26.669> me<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.940> nice<00:03:27.209> amount

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
volume but it does give me a nice amount

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.270 
volume but it does give me a nice amount
of<00:03:27.690> volume<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.229> nothing<00:03:28.859> compares<00:03:29.129> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
of volume but nothing compares to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.170 
of volume but nothing compares to
colossal<00:03:29.639> or<00:03:30.150> lash<00:03:30.780> box<00:03:31.139> but<00:03:31.319> front<00:03:31.590> every<00:03:31.889> day

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
colossal or lash box but front every day

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.339 
colossal or lash box but front every day
looking<00:03:33.180> mascara<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.139> great

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
looking mascara I think this is great

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.379 
looking mascara I think this is great
it's<00:03:34.620> not<00:03:34.829> overly<00:03:35.190> dramatic<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.180> nice

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
it's not overly dramatic it's just nice

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.050 
it's not overly dramatic it's just nice
it<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.229> gives<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.919> lashes<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.400> separation

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it it gives you lashes that separation

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.479 
it it gives you lashes that separation
and<00:03:39.510> defines<00:03:39.900> each<00:03:40.169> one<00:03:40.409> of<00:03:40.440> them<00:03:40.650> hence<00:03:41.310> I

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
and defines each one of them hence I

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.800 
and defines each one of them hence I
guess<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.819> fact<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> it's<00:03:42.299> from<00:03:42.449> to<00:03:42.599> find

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
guess the fact that it's from to find

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.390 
guess the fact that it's from to find
the<00:03:42.930> lash<00:03:43.079> um<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:44.879> do<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.449> it<00:03:45.799> but<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:47.310> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the lash um so I do like it but like I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.770 
the lash um so I do like it but like I
said<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.579> think<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:47.879> mostly<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.329> four<00:03:48.599> wheel

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
said I think it's mostly the four wheel

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.059 
said I think it's mostly the four wheel
that<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.959> really<00:03:49.199> liked<00:03:49.409> don't<00:03:49.560> get<00:03:49.709> me<00:03:49.859> wrong

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
that I really liked don't get me wrong

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.009 
that I really liked don't get me wrong
the<00:03:50.099> fact<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:50.849> vibrates<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.419> really<00:03:51.810> cool

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
the fact that it vibrates is really cool

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.469 
the fact that it vibrates is really cool
I<00:03:52.079> think<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.500> me<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.280> feels<00:03:53.579> neat<00:03:53.909> putting<00:03:54.359> it

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
I think it's me it feels neat putting it

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.809 
I think it's me it feels neat putting it
on<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.870> really<00:03:55.139> like<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.530> um<00:03:55.760> would<00:03:56.760> i

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
on I really like it um would i

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.199 
on I really like it um would i
repurchase<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.799> not<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.159> retail<00:03:59.609> price<00:03:59.790> i

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
repurchase it not for the retail price i

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.080 
repurchase it not for the retail price i
would<00:04:00.569> definitely<00:04:00.900> wait<00:04:01.430> until<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.519> was<00:04:02.669> BOGO

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
would definitely wait until it was BOGO

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.969 
would definitely wait until it was BOGO
again<00:04:03.479> somewhere<00:04:04.049> before<00:04:04.439> I<00:04:04.500> would<00:04:04.709> pick<00:04:04.859> it

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
again somewhere before I would pick it

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.599 
again somewhere before I would pick it
up<00:04:05.180> cuz<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.359> me<00:04:06.389> 1299<00:04:07.079> on<00:04:07.470> my<00:04:08.010> mascara<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.579> a

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
up cuz to me 1299 on my mascara is a

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.189 
up cuz to me 1299 on my mascara is a
little<00:04:08.909> too<00:04:09.060> much<00:04:09.239> especially<00:04:09.359> when<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> don't

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
little too much especially when I don't

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.710 
little too much especially when I don't
find<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.919> actual<00:04:11.189> vibration<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:12.000> doing

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
find that the actual vibration is doing

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.270 
find that the actual vibration is doing
anything<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:14.329> above<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.509> beyond<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
anything like above and beyond the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.420 
anything like above and beyond the
mascara<00:04:17.280> itself<00:04:17.759> if<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.269> makes<00:04:18.449> sense<00:04:18.659> um

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
mascara itself if that makes sense um

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.640 
mascara itself if that makes sense um
but<00:04:20.430> all<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.820> all<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> do<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.930> i<00:04:22.469> would

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
but all in all I do like it and i would

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.589 
but all in all I do like it and i would
definitely<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.279> know<00:04:23.400> recommend<00:04:23.909> someone<00:04:24.450> to

try it if it was on sale

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.249 
try it if it was on sale
