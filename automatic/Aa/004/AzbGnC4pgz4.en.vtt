blue now this is like kind of baby blue
but<00:02:09.510> again<00:02:09.840> many<00:02:10.530> figures<00:02:11.010> they<00:02:11.280> change<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
but again many figures they change the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.260 
but again many figures they change the
color<00:02:11.970> due<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.820> motion<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.880> making<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
color due to the motion of making it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.240 
color due to the motion of making it
look<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.840> they<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.290> their<00:02:16.680> aura<00:02:16.920> or

when they're on Super Saiyan they go

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.840 
when they're on Super Saiyan they go
bright<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.160> gonna<00:02:20.310> be<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.550> dark

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
have a little proof showing why this is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 
have a little proof showing why this is
a<00:02:27.150> bit<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.410> paint<00:02:28.830> job<00:02:29.130> because<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.910> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
now look at the post this is the exact

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
now look at the post this is the exact
same<00:02:36.780> version<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> same<00:02:39.420> isn't<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.340> look

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
same version it's the same isn't it look

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.780 
same version it's the same isn't it look
at<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.520> now<00:02:42.830> another<00:02:43.830> part<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.550> is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
at that now another part about this is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.729 
at that now another part about this is
that<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.630> face<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.170> only<00:02:46.380> thing<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.620> a

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
that the face is the only thing of a

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.550 
that the face is the only thing of a
difference<00:02:47.190> has<00:02:47.790> Vegeta<00:02:48.360> here<00:02:48.780> he's<00:02:49.140> just

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
difference has Vegeta here he's just

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.360 
difference has Vegeta here he's just
looking<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:51.450> know<00:02:51.480> making<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.530> usual<00:02:53.010> face

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
looking you know making that usual face

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.260 
looking you know making that usual face
expression<00:02:54.180> matter<00:02:54.630> right<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:56.090> he<00:02:57.090> looks

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
expression matter right here he looks

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.880 
expression matter right here he looks
like<00:02:57.360> he's<00:02:57.600> charging<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.530> his<00:02:58.650> key<00:02:59.209> so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
like he's charging up his key so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.660 
like he's charging up his key so
possibly<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.980> could<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.489> been<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
possibly it could have just been the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.880 
possibly it could have just been the
head<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.080> face<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.620> could<00:03:04.800> have

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
head in the face if they could have

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.010 
head in the face if they could have
changed<00:03:05.100> because<00:03:05.370> everything<00:03:05.850> else<00:03:06.030> looks

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
changed because everything else looks

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.880 
changed because everything else looks
the<00:03:07.440> same<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:10.020> see<00:03:10.170> any<00:03:10.320> complaints

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the same and I don't see any complaints

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.490 
the same and I don't see any complaints
about<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.239> think<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.690> like<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
about this I think I like it I like the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.760 
about this I think I like it I like the
style<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.100> went<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.770> mean

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
style that they went with it and I mean

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.370 
style that they went with it and I mean
I<00:03:16.980> can't<00:03:17.820> argue<00:03:17.940> with<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.209> right<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:19.230> pretty

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
I can't argue with it right it's pretty
