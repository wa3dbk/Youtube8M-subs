00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
round off lick twist rounds that double

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.770 
round off lick twist rounds that double
twist<00:02:49.730> round<00:02:49.909> off<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.150> talked<00:02:50.329> anything

twist round off that talked anything

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.629 
twist round off that talked anything
then<00:02:51.200> that's<00:02:51.409> all<00:02:51.560> getting<00:02:51.829> new<00:02:51.919> marks<00:02:52.280> and

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
then that's all getting new marks and

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.809 
then that's all getting new marks and
all<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.540> trampolining<00:02:54.139> skills<00:02:54.700> whether<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
all the trampolining skills whether it

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.059 
all the trampolining skills whether it
be<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.030> jump<00:02:56.269> skills<00:02:56.659> body<00:02:57.409> positioning

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
be the jump skills body positioning

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.839 
be the jump skills body positioning
rotations<00:02:58.879> are<00:02:59.480> all<00:02:59.689> used<00:02:59.989> within

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
rotations are all used within

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.429 
rotations are all used within
cheerleading<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.419> think<00:03:02.689> that's<00:03:02.959> why<00:03:03.230> it's

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
cheerleading and I think that's why it's

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.110 
cheerleading and I think that's why it's
helped<00:03:03.769> us<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:04.040> where<00:03:04.159> Nationals<00:03:04.549> not<00:03:04.819> he's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
helped us to where Nationals not he's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.610 
helped us to where Nationals not he's
not<00:03:05.359> just<00:03:05.629> like<00:03:05.810> these<00:03:06.079> people<00:03:06.349> have<00:03:06.500> come

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
not just like these people have come

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.289 
not just like these people have come
from<00:03:06.829> nowhere<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.370> they've<00:03:07.549> never<00:03:07.760> done<00:03:08.060> like

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
from nowhere and they've never done like

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.819 
from nowhere and they've never done like
any<00:03:08.510> gymnastics<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.349> only<00:03:09.469> trade<00:03:09.680> them<00:03:09.799> for

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
any gymnastics or I only trade them for

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
maybe at the end of a career or if they

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.399 
maybe at the end of a career or if they
decide<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.340> they<00:03:16.700> need<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.230> take<00:03:18.230> another

decide that they need to take another
path<00:03:18.769> they<00:03:18.950> could<00:03:19.099> use<00:03:19.250> those<00:03:19.459> skills<00:03:19.730> very

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
path they could use those skills very

easily coming into cheerleading it's a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.849 
easily coming into cheerleading it's a
lot<00:03:22.639> of<00:03:22.669> wasted<00:03:23.169> skills<00:03:24.169> when<00:03:24.409> they<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.709> give
