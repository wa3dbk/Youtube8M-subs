00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 we do not have there is there but we do not have 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.529
 half cup olive oil one 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 onion cut juliana juliana is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 equal to pen also so that the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 people not in the jungle and 8 peppers in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.000
 this time we are lucky to have 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.740
 all the colored peppers that are 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 see more beautiful green and yellow reds 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 ok you've already cut in julienne also and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.550
 4 medium-sized tomatoes without seeds 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 basically the seed is removed because 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.289
 It gives a lot of liquid but in the sky only 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 The seed is removed, the skin is cut off 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.830
 also although it is advisable and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 cut into strips salt and pepper 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 then it started in the background we took the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
 oil in a little good a frying pan or in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 a pot what we have to cook and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.440
 onion being onion first 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 clear heats the hot oil the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.230
 oil is then added onion 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 although onion we take a little while 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 well about two minutes until it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 caramelize or not not only not until 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.800
 that it gets transparent ok then 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 we toss the tomatoes 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.660
 let's see the peppers all then there 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.470
 we add because you do not have to say 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.470
 everything you do 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 Pepper 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 If you do not have green pepper 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.740
 that if not 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.740
 if you taste it is very intense, it's like 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.329
 to know how to handle it white pepper 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.159
 things if you are the collection you drop a 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.990
 little bad is that if you can throw 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.079
 lose a whole dish if you do not know 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.789
 drive 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.770
 Well, what are we going to do after 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.939
 the first the first cream once 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.159
 she is ready 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.420
 I said and here we are going to do preserves 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.890
 we have mccann it's huge so we're going to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.219
 put them in the jar once it is 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 the idea is that the trucks do not feel 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.209
 no problem that the idea is that the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.209
 peppers are 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.000
 They must be cooked but it does 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.000
 because we have to stay like this 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.769
 hot or cold to start we can 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.860
 be hot and it was already cold 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.849
 important is that the bottle is 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.519
 sterilized and for that we need 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.780
 serve them in water in hot water and 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.970
 because so you do not have any 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.829
 I develop any kind of stories of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.549
 We take out in hot water we let 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.549
 boil a while 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.400
 it's exactly for all kinds of 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.379
 vermin that may exist having 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.359
 someone and then we fill our 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.859
 source 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.599
 first I will serve here so they can 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.739
 taste a little here and then I'll 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.170
 fill the preserve and I'll show you 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.329
 ok and it's always made and I asked you 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.940
 about the sterilization of 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.000
 francs the sterilization of the bottles 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.430
 we have to throw it out 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.920
 in a pot with boiling water we 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.860
 let boil 5 minutes and you 're ready 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.300
 now we have to taste the p 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.610
 but we can not use it to 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.500
 accompany salads to accompany 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.060
 hot dishes but we can put in 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.680
 these little rolls with cheese 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.630
 cream and we put that perona is 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.940
 over and can also be served cold 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.180
 warm hot right now once we have 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.420
 the franco and I will fill it with 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.660
 our 6 as meat also know if in 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.000
 the grill is one of these things 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.620
 metal if you also put a demented 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.620
 before it was like that a metallic paper 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 that is well roasted 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.090
 how are we going to be me 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.090
 do not go 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.489
 I think you need the gift to go 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:27.360
 clean up our frank we 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.360
 we have to fill out of hitting him 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.050
 to remove the excess air there 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.570
 in between then the preserves and 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 we will have to fill only up to one 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.460
 finger up the bottle because 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.770
 because we need to let him air 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.419
 because I do not know that the air is very 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.070
 contaminated very clear what happens that 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.810
 and now to eliminate it 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.919
 we have to fill this with oil because 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.919
 the oil is a conserving 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.789
 agre sugar is now preserved here 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:02.929
 we have set our 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.479
 preserves and we're going to use it 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:07.069
 within ten fifteen days already and what 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.049
 we keep in the refrigerator but if 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.509
 we would like to keep it as for another 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:13.969
 season we take this jar so be 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.889
 sealed and we put it inside a pot 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.719
 where we have to put a cloth of 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.489
 kitchen in the background or a good there is a 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.709
 special grid for that but if not 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:23.119
 We put newspaper or cloths 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:26.569
 kitchen so that the 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:29.569
 jars and we put water until more or 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.819
 less to half already francis and those 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.949
 Let boil for at least 20 minutes 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.719
 then the heating starts 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.509
 interior and the attempt starts at 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.399
 occur from internal vapor and causes 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.889
 the little button of the cup 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:44.899
 the maximum armchair clearly this has been 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.839
 closed the emptiness this serves for everything 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:50.479
 type of preserves either for jams 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.369
 ies and that would last for example Tunisia 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.849
 of one and nothing should last us 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:59.959
 around ten twelve months 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.800
 if they do not ensure once opened so 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:05.749
 then there you no longer have to use but 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.559
 it lasts in the refrigerator about ten 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:11.929
 about ten days more it can be damaged but 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.089
 nothing faith but nothing looks can be used 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:16.189
 for eg I love me 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.740
 they love potatoes for example that is me 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:22.629
 sometimes I make a rich sauce it will cost me 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.629
 some potatoes and mom for like 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.349
 accompaniment for all then you 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.909
 you can be of this one but cream or 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.509
 you can be some next to a rich 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.509
 lettuce 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:40.039
 basically vegetarian also that 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.689
 you can put with very little very little the 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.889
 true less and less but by options 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.889
 and one pound chicken
