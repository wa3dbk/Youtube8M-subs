00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
idea about that player and when you're

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.330 
idea about that player and when you're
playing<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> competitive<00:00:24.000> match<00:00:25.220> well<00:00:26.220> make

that's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.910> good<00:00:27.060> question<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.550> quite

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that's a really good question and quite

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
that's a really good question and quite
honestly<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.090> something<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.480> most<00:00:30.750> tennis

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
honestly it's something that most tennis

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.260 
honestly it's something that most tennis
players<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> poor<00:00:31.830> job<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.000> think

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
players do a poor job of and I think

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
players do a poor job of and I think
that<00:00:33.420> most<00:00:33.719> players<00:00:33.989> walk<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.649> onto<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that most players walk out onto the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
that most players walk out onto the
courts<00:00:35.510> against<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.660> new<00:00:37.020> opponent<00:00:37.350> somebody

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
courts against a new opponent somebody

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
courts against a new opponent somebody
that<00:00:38.010> they've<00:00:38.160> never<00:00:38.489> seen<00:00:38.790> before<00:00:38.850> they've

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that they've never seen before they've

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.310 
that they've never seen before they've
never<00:00:39.510> played<00:00:39.780> before

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
never played before

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.049

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059

probably<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.060> best<00:02:27.269> tip<00:02:27.540> I've<00:02:27.719> ever<00:02:27.900> heard<00:02:28.079> on

probably the best tip I've ever heard on
this<00:02:28.439> is<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.430> remember<00:02:30.329> reading<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.019> when<00:02:31.200> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this is I remember reading this when I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.020 
this is I remember reading this when I

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the suggestion you know when you're

give you immediate intelligence on what

give you immediate intelligence on what
they<00:02:57.900> prefer<00:02:58.400> maybe<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.790> feed<00:02:59.969> a<00:03:00.000> little<00:03:00.180> bit

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
they prefer maybe you feed a little bit

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.659 
they prefer maybe you feed a little bit
to<00:03:00.540> their<00:03:00.689> left<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.889> move<00:03:02.099> way<00:03:02.370> out<00:03:02.549> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
their way to hit a forehand and so that

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.259 
their way to hit a forehand and so that
should<00:03:04.409> you<00:03:04.709> should<00:03:04.919> be<00:03:05.010> paying<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:05.340> very

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
should you should be paying very very

close attention to that those kinds of

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
kinds of things because it'll give you

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.899 
kinds of things because it'll give you
immediate<00:03:10.859> feedback<00:03:10.889> on<00:03:11.400> what<00:03:11.730> they're

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
immediate feedback on what they're

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.569 
immediate feedback on what they're
probably<00:03:12.299> going<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.200> prefer<00:03:13.769> or<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.250> prefer

during the match other things to look

during the match other things to look
out<00:03:16.919> for<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.940> they<00:03:18.060> take<00:03:18.299> volleys<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:19.019> lot<00:03:19.500> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
out for do they take volleys a lot of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.289 
out for do they take volleys a lot of
times<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:19.979> a<00:03:20.069> singles<00:03:20.430> match<00:03:20.489> your<00:03:20.909> opponent

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
times in a singles match your opponent

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.210 
times in a singles match your opponent
won't<00:03:21.389> even<00:03:21.720> come<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> net<00:03:22.440> if<00:03:22.709> they

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
won't even come up to the net if they

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.399 
won't even come up to the net if they
don't<00:03:23.400> hit<00:03:23.549> any<00:03:23.790> volleys<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.599> any<00:03:24.840> net<00:03:25.109> shots

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
don't hit any volleys or any net shots

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.229 
don't hit any volleys or any net shots
at<00:03:25.620> all<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.400> that's<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.639> pretty<00:03:26.909> strong

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
at all and that's a pretty strong

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.539 
at all and that's a pretty strong
indicator<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.139> they<00:03:28.349> don't<00:03:28.530> plan<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:29.069> coming

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
indicator that they don't plan on coming

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.580 
indicator that they don't plan on coming
up<00:03:29.669> there<00:03:29.819> much<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.389> they're<00:03:30.870> probably<00:03:31.379> not

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
up there much and they're probably not

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.349 
up there much and they're probably not
super<00:03:31.949> comfortable<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.729> so<00:03:33.180> that's

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
super comfortable there and so that's

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.030 
super comfortable there and so that's
information<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.470> use<00:03:34.500> against

hit<00:03:39.269> overheads<00:03:39.689> you<00:03:40.109> know<00:03:40.169> they'll<00:03:40.319> hit<00:03:40.530> like

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
hit overheads you know they'll hit like

though<00:03:42.689> they'll<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.229> just<00:03:43.560> kind<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.829> go

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
though they'll really just kind of go

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.179 
though they'll really just kind of go
halfway<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.900> they'll<00:03:46.590> hit<00:03:46.769> volleys

halfway on it and they'll hit volleys

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.059 
halfway on it and they'll hit volleys
for<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.639> it's<00:03:48.629> five<00:03:48.989> ten<00:03:49.409> shots<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.979> then

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
for like it's five ten shots and then

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.349 
for like it's five ten shots and then
just<00:03:50.220> go<00:03:50.310> right<00:03:50.489> back<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.879> baseline<00:03:51.239> they

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
just go right back to the baseline they

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.390 
just go right back to the baseline they
don't<00:03:51.569> ask<00:03:51.689> for<00:03:51.810> overheads<00:03:52.259> that's<00:03:52.979> a<00:03:53.159> big

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
don't ask for overheads that's a big

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.520 
don't ask for overheads that's a big
piece<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.699> information<00:03:53.970> at<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.079> very<00:03:55.290> least

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
piece of information at the very least

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.589 
piece of information at the very least
they<00:03:56.009> haven't<00:03:56.189> hit<00:03:56.430> any<00:03:56.579> overheads<00:03:57.060> today<00:03:57.359> and

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
they haven't hit any overheads today and

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.149 
they haven't hit any overheads today and
the<00:03:58.019> very<00:03:58.049> first<00:03:58.560> one<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.799> they're<00:03:59.040> gonna

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
the very first one that they're gonna

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.949 
the very first one that they're gonna
receive<00:03:59.549> from<00:03:59.879> you<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.239> going<00:04:00.419> to<00:04:00.509> be<00:04:00.629> when<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
receive from you is going to be when it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.229 
receive from you is going to be when it
really<00:04:01.229> counts<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.310> pressure<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.939> I

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
really counts and the pressure is on I

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.270 
really counts and the pressure is on I
mean<00:04:03.599> this<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:04.199> are<00:04:04.349> all<00:04:04.500> little<00:04:04.769> pieces<00:04:05.040> of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
mean this these are all little pieces of

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.189 
mean this these are all little pieces of
information<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.239> really<00:04:06.599> use<00:04:06.900> here

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
information that you can really use here

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.909 
information that you can really use here
advantage

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
advantage

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.189

lastly<00:04:09.199> actually<00:04:10.199> two<00:04:10.829> more<00:04:10.949> quick<00:04:11.220> points

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
lastly actually two more quick points

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.140 
lastly actually two more quick points
look<00:04:13.199> for<00:04:13.650> where<00:04:13.949> their<00:04:14.099> misses<00:04:14.579> are<00:04:14.759> look<00:04:14.970> for

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
look for where their misses are look for

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.420 
look for where their misses are look for
patterns<00:04:15.629> of<00:04:15.810> misses<00:04:16.229> when<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.009> hit<00:04:17.159> to<00:04:17.280> their

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
patterns of misses when you hit to their

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.979 
patterns of misses when you hit to their
backhand<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.060> they<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.449> move<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.840> little

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
backhand and they have to move a little

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.899 
backhand and they have to move a little
bit<00:04:19.199> to<00:04:19.560> their<00:04:20.009> backhand<00:04:20.190> side

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
do they miss into the net or they tend

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.890 
do they miss into the net or they tend
to<00:04:22.979> kind<00:04:23.279> of<00:04:23.370> catch<00:04:24.029> it<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.300> little<00:04:24.539> late<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
to kind of catch it a little late and

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.560 
to kind of catch it a little late and
they<00:04:24.960> tend<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.289> miss<00:04:25.500> wide<00:04:26.130> down<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:26.909> line

they tend to miss wide down the line
have<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.720> really<00:04:28.020> hard<00:04:28.200> time<00:04:28.440> getting<00:04:28.500> it

they never hit the net but they tend to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.440 
they never hit the net but they tend to
miss<00:04:34.050> long<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.850> they're<00:04:35.850> kind<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.150> over

hitting over and over again those types
of<00:04:38.760> patterns<00:04:39.210> are<00:04:39.420> priceless<00:04:40.020> because<00:04:40.770> they

of patterns are priceless because they

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
paint a picture in your mind of what you

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.860 
paint a picture in your mind of what you

can do strategically to make them

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.440 
can do strategically to make them
uncomfortable<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:51.150> should<00:04:51.360> be<00:04:51.420> the

uncomfortable and that should be the

uncomfortable and give you the upper

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.840 
uncomfortable and give you the upper
hand<00:04:57.750> consistently<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.520> can<00:04:59.700> come

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
hand consistently so that you can come

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.870 
hand consistently so that you can come
out<00:04:59.940> on<00:05:00.150> top<00:05:00.420> as<00:05:00.660> often<00:05:01.170> as<00:05:01.350> possible<00:05:01.670> the<00:05:02.670> last

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
out on top as often as possible the last

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.900 
out on top as often as possible the last
thing<00:05:03.090> I'll<00:05:03.180> say<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.390> just<00:05:03.810> simply<00:05:04.350> that<00:05:04.910> very

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
thing I'll say is just simply that very

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.080 
thing I'll say is just simply that very
often<00:05:06.210> what<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:06.810> see<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.200> warm-up

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
often what you see in the warm-up

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.130 
often what you see in the warm-up
changes<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> little<00:05:09.420> bit<00:05:09.540> when<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.840> really

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
changes a little bit when it really

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.080 
changes a little bit when it really
counts<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.770> maybe<00:05:11.310> you'll<00:05:11.550> see<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.000> know

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
counts and maybe you'll see you know

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.610 
counts and maybe you'll see you know
they<00:05:12.210> don't<00:05:12.420> practice<00:05:12.900> their<00:05:13.050> volleys<00:05:13.320> at<00:05:13.440> all

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
they don't practice their volleys at all

once<00:05:42.630> you've<00:05:43.170> served<00:05:43.500> once<00:05:43.770> now<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.520> should

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
once you've served once now you should

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.480 
once you've served once now you should
have<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:45.030> really<00:05:45.540> solid<00:05:46.110> game<00:05:46.410> plan<00:05:46.770> in<00:05:47.310> place

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
have a really solid game plan in place

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.610 
have a really solid game plan in place
and<00:05:47.880> doesn't<00:05:48.570> mean<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:49.050> shouldn't

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
and doesn't mean that you shouldn't

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.290 
and doesn't mean that you shouldn't
probably<00:05:50.130> make<00:05:50.280> some<00:05:50.490> small<00:05:50.790> adjustments

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
probably make some small adjustments

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.180 
probably make some small adjustments
along<00:05:51.390> the<00:05:51.540> way<00:05:51.660> but<00:05:52.560> now<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:52.740> should<00:05:52.860> have<00:05:53.160> a

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
along the way but now you should have a

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.330 
along the way but now you should have a
solid<00:05:53.580> idea<00:05:54.450> of<00:05:54.780> what<00:05:55.320> it's<00:05:55.470> going<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.650> take<00:05:55.890> to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
solid idea of what it's going to take to

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.830 
solid idea of what it's going to take to
win<00:05:56.580> during<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.720> day's<00:05:58.350> particular<00:05:58.830> match

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
win during that day's particular match

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.110 
win during that day's particular match
so<00:06:01.010> make<00:06:02.010> hopefully<00:06:02.310> that's<00:06:02.610> really<00:06:02.880> helpful

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
so make hopefully that's really helpful
