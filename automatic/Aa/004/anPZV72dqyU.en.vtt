calipers<00:02:04.310> are<00:02:04.490> insane<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.600> know<00:02:05.719> it's<00:02:05.929> got

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
calipers are insane you know it's got

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.419 
calipers are insane you know it's got
just<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.409> lot<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.649> trick<00:02:06.799> parts<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.219> have

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
just a lot of trick parts on it have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.160 
just a lot of trick parts on it have
rear<00:02:07.579> shocks<00:02:07.819> crazy<00:02:08.269> it's<00:02:08.539> like<00:02:08.780> fully

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
rear shocks crazy it's like fully

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.369 
rear shocks crazy it's like fully
adjustable<00:02:09.709> everything's<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.489> tweakable

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
adjustable everything's like tweakable

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.440 
adjustable everything's like tweakable
all<00:02:12.379> together<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.099> was<00:02:13.310> harder<00:02:13.760> than<00:02:13.970> I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
all together it was harder than I

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.520 
all together it was harder than I
expected

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
expected

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.030 
expected
but<00:02:15.799> not<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.700> bill<00:02:16.879> itself<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.410> be

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
but not the bill itself just to be

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.550 
but not the bill itself just to be
inside<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.610> time<00:02:20.150> frame<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.019> know<00:02:21.200> still

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
inside that time frame you know still

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.380 
inside that time frame you know still
went<00:02:21.799> well<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.220> think<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.910> accomplished

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
went well I think we accomplished

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
went well I think we accomplished
exactly<00:02:24.230> what<00:02:24.379> we<00:02:24.470> set<00:02:24.650> out<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.549> paint

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
exactly what we set out to do the paint

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.520 
exactly what we set out to do the paint
job<00:02:25.970> came<00:02:26.150> out<00:02:26.299> stellar<00:02:26.660> crisp<00:02:27.049> wood<00:02:27.230> at<00:02:27.410> air

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
job came out stellar crisp wood at air

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.110 
job came out stellar crisp wood at air
tricks<00:02:27.799> did<00:02:27.950> an<00:02:28.040> amazing<00:02:28.250> job<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.910> paint

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
tricks did an amazing job on the paint

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.780 
tricks did an amazing job on the paint
from<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> beginning<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.410> thought<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:31.549> would<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
from the beginning I thought it would a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.640 
from the beginning I thought it would a
good<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.209> would<00:02:32.329> be<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.510> good<00:02:32.690> idea<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.349> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
good it would be a good idea to have the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.650 
good it would be a good idea to have the
bike<00:02:33.829> painted<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.430> gold<00:02:34.640> because<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> never<00:02:35.450> saw

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
bike painted in gold because I never saw

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.870 
bike painted in gold because I never saw
a<00:02:35.690> gold<00:02:35.989> BMX<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.799> when<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> received<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
a gold BMX you know when I received the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.150 
a gold BMX you know when I received the
parts<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.450> was<00:02:39.019> really<00:02:39.500> hard<00:02:39.769> for<00:02:39.860> me<00:02:40.130> to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
parts that was really hard for me to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.460 
parts that was really hard for me to
imagine<00:02:40.549> if<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.000> will<00:02:41.390> really<00:02:41.930> match<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
imagine if that will really match the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.170 
imagine if that will really match the
bike<00:02:42.650> because<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.370> rest<00:02:43.549> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> bike<00:02:44.000> is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
bike because the rest of the bike is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.630 
bike because the rest of the bike is
silver<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.720> black<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.319> know<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.709> think<00:02:46.220> you're

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
silver and black you know I think you're

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.390 
silver and black you know I think you're
the<00:02:46.880> bit<00:02:47.299> was<00:02:47.480> very<00:02:47.900> difficult<00:02:48.140> because<00:02:48.500> we

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
the bit was very difficult because we

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.759 
the bit was very difficult because we
don't<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.090> much<00:02:50.209> time<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.560> build<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
don't have so much time to build the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.729 
don't have so much time to build the
bike<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.160> he's<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:53.019> drugging<00:02:54.019> ruin<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.590> bike

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
bike so he's was a drugging ruin to bike

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.130 
bike so he's was a drugging ruin to bike
to<00:02:54.769> finish<00:02:55.220> by<00:02:55.430> time<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:56.690> got<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> thing<00:02:57.049> to

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
to finish by time we got the thing to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.990 
to finish by time we got the thing to
sit<00:02:57.379> pretty<00:02:57.530> good<00:02:57.769> it's<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.160> high<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:58.850> it's

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
sit pretty good it's it's high but it's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.030 
sit pretty good it's it's high but it's
a<00:02:59.060> rider<00:02:59.269> like<00:02:59.630> we<00:02:59.750> built<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.079> motorcycle<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
a rider like we built a motorcycle to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.979 
a rider like we built a motorcycle to
ride<00:03:01.250> not<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.549> motorcycle<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.389> sit<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.840> look

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
ride not a motorcycle to sit and look

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.080 
ride not a motorcycle to sit and look
pretty<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:04.579> know<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.850> think<00:03:04.940> we

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
pretty so you know I think we

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.509 
pretty so you know I think we
accomplished<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.630> goal<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:06.019> think<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.280> would

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
accomplished that goal I think I would

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.660 
accomplished that goal I think I would
like<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.850> like<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.450> bike<00:03:08.600> because<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:10.459> AG

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
like I like the bike because it's AG

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.309 
like I like the bike because it's AG
receives<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.329> would<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.049> at<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
receives that I would like at the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.949 
receives that I would like at the
beginning<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.859> bike<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.720> was<00:03:14.720> futuristic

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
beginning of the bike and was futuristic

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.620 
beginning of the bike and was futuristic
and<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.739> AG<00:03:16.370> receive<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.880> or<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.090> wanted<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
and the AG receive it or I wanted that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.559 
and the AG receive it or I wanted that
too<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.590> bike<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:20.150> turned<00:03:20.389> out

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
too I like the bike this it turned out

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.690 
too I like the bike this it turned out
actually<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.170> way<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.350> planned<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.519> know

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
actually the way I planned to you know

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
actually the way I planned to you know
so<00:03:23.000> I'm<00:03:23.329> really<00:03:23.599> satisfied<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.440> bike

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
so I'm really satisfied with the bike

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.780 
so I'm really satisfied with the bike
and<00:03:24.950> his<00:03:25.489> look<00:03:26.200> maybe<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.440> we<00:03:27.620> had<00:03:27.799> more<00:03:28.430> time

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
and his look maybe if we had more time

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.250 
and his look maybe if we had more time
it<00:03:29.150> would<00:03:29.630> be<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> little<00:03:30.230> bit

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it would be a little bit

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.470 
it would be a little bit
radical<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.470> know<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.760> most<00:03:33.940> important

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
radical you know but the most important

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.470 
radical you know but the most important
thing<00:03:34.630> as<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.900> already<00:03:35.050> said<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:36.310> keep<00:03:37.300> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
thing as I already said is to keep the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.940 
thing as I already said is to keep the
bike<00:03:38.220> street-legal<00:03:39.220> Jim

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.610 

we<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.600> paid<00:03:48.080> attention<00:03:48.440> to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
we just really paid attention to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.990 
we just really paid attention to
aesthetically<00:03:49.310> trying<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.670> make<00:03:49.819> things

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
aesthetically trying to make things

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.840 
aesthetically trying to make things
right<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:51.110> little<00:03:51.230> bit<00:03:51.500> cleaner<00:03:52.220> kind<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.760> a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
right and a little bit cleaner kind of a

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.990 
right and a little bit cleaner kind of a
more<00:03:53.150> aggressive<00:03:53.630> approach<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.200> what's<00:03:54.380> like

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
more aggressive approach to what's like

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.040 
more aggressive approach to what's like
to<00:03:56.000> what<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.150> think<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> heart<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.900> bike

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
to what I think the heart of the bike

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.750 
to what I think the heart of the bike
really<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:58.160> ultra<00:03:58.610> aggressive

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
really is is just this ultra aggressive

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.570 
really is is just this ultra aggressive
more<00:03:59.480> race<00:03:59.720> styled<00:04:00.170> machine<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:00.890> we<00:04:01.340> went<00:04:01.520> a

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
more race styled machine so we went a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.130 
more race styled machine so we went a
little<00:04:01.700> bit<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.090> direction<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.720> think<00:04:02.780> I

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
little bit that direction I think I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:15.979 
little bit that direction I think I
think<00:04:03.410> we<00:04:03.530> hit<00:04:03.650> it

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.890 

the<00:04:16.989> big<00:04:17.200> challenge<00:04:17.530> for<00:04:17.650> me<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.160> was<00:04:18.370> to

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
the big challenge for me it was to

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.440 
the big challenge for me it was to
conserve<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.160> feeling<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.430> v-max<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
conserve the feeling of the v-max so the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.620 
conserve the feeling of the v-max so the
intake<00:04:22.870> air<00:04:23.110> outside<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.190> exhaust<00:04:24.760> for<00:04:25.450> me

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
intake air outside and exhaust for me

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.409 
intake air outside and exhaust for me
most<00:04:26.169> have<00:04:26.350> not<00:04:26.590> be<00:04:26.919> Chandra<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.150> place

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
most have not be Chandra of the place

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.590 
most have not be Chandra of the place
and<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:29.560> was<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> challenge<00:04:30.220> for<00:04:30.280> me<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.730> keep

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
and it was a challenge for me to keep

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.409 
and it was a challenge for me to keep
the<00:04:31.780> spirit<00:04:32.169> of<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.560> v-max<00:04:33.070> still<00:04:33.790> also

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
the spirit of the v-max still also

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.440 
the spirit of the v-max still also
during<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.960> building<00:04:35.380> process<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:36.100> was

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
during the building process I was

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.970 
during the building process I was
immediately<00:04:37.450> addicted<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.320> sit<00:04:38.530> on<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> bike
