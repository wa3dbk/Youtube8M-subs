00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
different you know expressions and stuff

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.449 
different you know expressions and stuff
going<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.320> whole<00:04:19.410> way<00:04:19.470> through<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.130> will<00:04:20.250> show

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
you as you can see different expressions

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.900 
you as you can see different expressions
for<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.479> different<00:04:24.690> characters<00:04:25.610> then<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:26.729> get

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
for the different characters then we get

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.210 
for the different characters then we get
this<00:04:27.090> one<00:04:27.360> as<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.660> can<00:04:27.780> see<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.890> one<00:04:29.130> is

then oh god i tried to catch him as you
can<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:43.349> it<00:04:43.409> continues

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
can see it continues

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.760 
can see it continues
and<00:04:45.730> then<00:04:46.390> we<00:04:46.480> go<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.960> diamonds<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.590> as

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
and then we go to the diamonds and as

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.070 
and then we go to the diamonds and as
you<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:47.980> see<00:04:48.010> they<00:04:48.370> are<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.330> same<00:04:49.570> as<00:04:49.870> well

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
you can see they are the same as well

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.720 
you can see they are the same as well
with<00:04:50.320> different<00:04:50.590> expressions<00:04:51.160> going<00:04:51.430> on<00:04:51.550> with

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
with different expressions going on with

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.300 
with different expressions going on with
them<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:53.200> deck<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.410> really<00:04:53.860> cool<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:54.250> how

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
them so this deck is really cool but how

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.050 
them so this deck is really cool but how
does<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.910> handle<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:56.140> first<00:04:56.410> off<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:57.060> dribbles

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
does it handle so first off it dribbles

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.510 
does it handle so first off it dribbles
quite<00:04:58.420> well<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.440> derivative<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.190> dribble

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
quite well is the derivative the dribble

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.760 
quite well is the derivative the dribble
and<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:00.700> is<00:05:00.850> really<00:05:01.180> goes<00:05:01.660> really<00:05:01.990> well<00:05:02.230> no

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
and this is really goes really well no

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.130 
and this is really goes really well no
prob<00:05:02.950> was<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.190> whatsoever<00:05:03.870> springs<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.050> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
prob was that whatsoever springs on the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.500 
prob was that whatsoever springs on the
deck<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> really<00:05:06.670> thin<00:05:06.880> stock<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.390> it's

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
deck it's a really thin stock so it's

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.210 
deck it's a really thin stock so it's
very<00:05:07.630> easy<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:08.110> springs<00:05:08.440> not<00:05:08.680> really<00:05:08.920> hard<00:05:09.100> at

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
very easy the springs not really hard at

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.760 
very easy the springs not really hard at
all<00:05:09.340> with<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.090> springs<00:05:10.420> it's<00:05:10.750> very<00:05:11.080> easy<00:05:11.320> no

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
all with the springs it's very easy no

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.320 
all with the springs it's very easy no
problems<00:05:12.190> at<00:05:12.280> all<00:05:12.400> with<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.700> springs<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
problems at all with the springs on the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.780 
problems at all with the springs on the
deck<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:15.070> looks<00:05:15.220> pretty<00:05:15.340> cool<00:05:15.580> your

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
deck and it looks pretty cool your

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.600 
deck and it looks pretty cool your
spring<00:05:15.970> you'd<00:05:16.270> have<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.480> massive<00:05:16.690> tweety<00:05:17.140> by

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
spring you'd have this massive tweety by

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.940 
spring you'd have this massive tweety by
flying<00:05:18.610> everywhere<00:05:19.650> but<00:05:20.650> other<00:05:20.800> than<00:05:20.890> that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
flying everywhere but other than that

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.070 
flying everywhere but other than that
it's<00:05:21.340> pretty<00:05:21.520> cool<00:05:21.850> for<00:05:22.000> handling<00:05:22.420> but<00:05:22.990> when

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
it's pretty cool for handling but when

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.720 
it's pretty cool for handling but when
you<00:05:23.170> go<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.320> fans<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.920> doesn't<00:05:24.190> fan<00:05:24.370> like<00:05:24.580> at

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
you go to fans it doesn't fan like at

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.390 
you go to fans it doesn't fan like at
all<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.690> know<00:05:25.950> reshuffles<00:05:26.950> obviously<00:05:27.340> you

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
all you know reshuffles obviously you

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.560 
all you know reshuffles obviously you
can<00:05:27.520> handle<00:05:27.880> if<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.150> do<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.390> wrong<00:05:28.510> way

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
can handle if you do it the wrong way

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.140 
can handle if you do it the wrong way
then<00:05:28.990> yeah<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:29.320> put<00:05:30.310> them<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.550> right<00:05:30.700> way<00:05:30.730> for

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
then yeah you put them the right way for

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.000 
then yeah you put them the right way for
the<00:05:31.240> mirror<00:05:31.540> back<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.080> downer<00:05:32.470> on<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.800> deck

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
the mirror back is a downer on the deck

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.610 
the mirror back is a downer on the deck
and<00:05:33.450> what<00:05:34.450> else<00:05:34.570> is<00:05:34.780> there<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:34.990> mention<00:05:35.380> oh<00:05:35.440> it

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
and what else is there to mention oh it

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.980 
and what else is there to mention oh it
spreads<00:05:36.010> it<00:05:36.430> kind<00:05:36.760> of<00:05:36.820> clumps<00:05:37.420> quite<00:05:37.660> a<00:05:37.690> lot

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
spreads it kind of clumps quite a lot

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.630 
spreads it kind of clumps quite a lot
even<00:05:38.680> your<00:05:38.800> sweat<00:05:38.950> on<00:05:38.980> table<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.430> kind<00:05:39.610> of

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
even your sweat on table you kind of

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.100 
even your sweat on table you kind of
clumps<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.120> kind<00:05:40.360> of<00:05:40.420> struggles<00:05:40.840> a<00:05:40.900> turn

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
clumps and it kind of struggles a turn

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.460 
clumps and it kind of struggles a turn
itself<00:05:41.410> over<00:05:41.860> as<00:05:41.980> well<00:05:42.280> so<00:05:43.000> he<00:05:43.450> for<00:05:44.080> handling

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
itself over as well so he for handling

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.140 
itself over as well so he for handling
obviously<00:05:44.920> doesn't<00:05:45.160> do<00:05:45.220> itself<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.640> great<00:05:45.880> deal

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
obviously doesn't do itself a great deal

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.480 
obviously doesn't do itself a great deal
but<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:47.200> be<00:05:47.350> honest<00:05:47.560> it's<00:05:47.740> just<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:48.010> really<00:05:48.250> cool

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
but to be honest it's just a really cool

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.190 
but to be honest it's just a really cool
deck<00:05:48.730> it's<00:05:48.910> very<00:05:49.150> old<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.750> hasn't<00:05:49.990> got<00:05:50.080> like
