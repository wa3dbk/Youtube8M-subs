00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.660
 if you haven't checked it on radio and watching tv is still a crisis 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.300
 in the end it was already a bit in sight, but it will be a while 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.679
 and we have a hard time 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.230
 and for our language but I have good news 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.200
 I have discovered how best to deal with setbacks 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.330
 it just has to be humorous, it is very cliché I know but it is 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 really what you should try to keep seeing a neighbor from 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.519
 of the week I woke up awake and came out on the front door 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.999
 I opened the door and I did not see a bailiff with me 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.980
 but also the front door of the pure police 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.900
 so loud it looked like it was with me 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.170
 and as a student and no one turned out to be bondage and goats and boxers 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.250
 until a boy suddenly opened and opened the doors 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500
 corner to knock 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.380
 you are not a voting right or something 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.790
 that's humor 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.090
 and I had to go shopping and have a fresh shower and drink yoghurt 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.840
 I cheerfully walk to the supermarket it was not very busy everything was ok anyway 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.210
 had to pay and the debit card did not d 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.720
 and now it is already I am at TMG 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.550
 you have i call those men already have internet from joe pesci a banker 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.459
 at i and give 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.379
 pestman live 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.580
 a donkey does not hit the same ground level internet twice 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.010
 banker apparently with only the week before all the room 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.789
 had internet banking problems but he also refused the debit card well 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.140
 then you stand nicely at the register with your mouth full of teeth 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.890
 one more time the not groessen try his shuffle in the line behind me 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.609
 I say sorry madam but apparently I can't enter 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.750
 alkmaar this is a pink checkout 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.180
 at the other taser you can pay with cash I have already passed once 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.800
 he has not the other fluff I tell you that as a dance pass I assume 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.650
 that you cannot pay with the bank shares 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.060
 no that is no longer he has az a new number I say not said say see 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 and that all went crazy 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.799
 i feel like i was just sort of communicating in iran i'm not saying 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.130
 which supermarket was but they should change their loved ones as soon as possible 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.840
 collision 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.980
 but yes, but the ATM outside this fits also so I decided I have 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.350
 you don't have a bank branch to go a few blocks away 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.400
 never been before but i could not have had it i had no money or money 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.740
 so are just like forced bushes down georgis it may be far away from you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.910
 bed and what do you care until you come across once 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.390
 He was really years ago since I entered my job but it says 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.260
 no one at the from the bank at the entrance welcomes you 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
 and i don't know what to say about the animals but this man stopped the and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.590
 soloists they don't have a thing for each other but they don't have one in here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.050
 In any case, people with disabilities at the tent were full of angry people 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.780
 remained uncertain 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.240
 the beaming can start and who asked if I wanted a cup of coffee is one 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.350
 talent became sadia well then we get a cup of coffee of seven 3 billion euros 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.559
 please 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.659
 humor continued to see the minds ran high on the woman was like that 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.759
 angry because they network card so he decides they wanted to pay it is not 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.829
 but we had to have them and girlfriend had to pay for her 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.950
 and that was social and 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.630
 and they took the strings out of the box and waved my dog ​​aggressively i thought 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.989
 she died but the poor lady was still alive and kicking 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.930
 a bank employee becomes a real naval power since we all know that 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.430
 could not pin and his people it is a small problem but are busy 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 is the velpe 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.530
 they think the world has been the doors attack it is not our attack then 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.899
 a lot of information is sent by the system at a time 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.059
 you can compare it to four women who talk about a vacation at the same time 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.019
 information flow your brain just can't be there, they just have it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.639
 completely flat 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.349
 it became completely silent on the couch and in that silence I stepped forward and spoke 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.679
 the legendary words the rules are rules this is just on the couch 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.929
 and I grabbed my card and women's double 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.359
 and then it became even faster 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.659
 but once conquer applause louder and louder everyone clapped the angry customers for me 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.790
 the coffee lady the bank employee armenia yes even decisive stopera 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.110
 several people from a debit card by they sweden with loud cheers in the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.750
 garbage can 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.959
 and then I was cleared away 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.639
 and it is not always possible that an action plan provided for the neighborhood 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.189
 and if that is true because of the fact that the authorities are just a little bit 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.739
 humor can see thank you
