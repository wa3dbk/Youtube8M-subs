00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
now and I will be alone against nine

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.159 
now and I will be alone against nine
BOTS<00:05:01.680> probably<00:05:03.480> wash<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.720> haven't<00:05:04.990> chosen

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
BOTS probably wash I haven't chosen

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.530 
BOTS probably wash I haven't chosen
difficulty<00:05:05.980> yet<00:05:06.160> but<00:05:06.850> I<00:05:06.880> think<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.300> would<00:05:07.419> make

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
difficulty yet but I think it would make

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.210 
difficulty yet but I think it would make
it<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.750> lot<00:05:07.780> more<00:05:07.930> interesting<00:05:08.320> if<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.800> put<00:05:08.980> it<00:05:09.070> on

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
it a lot more interesting if I put it on

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.380 
it a lot more interesting if I put it on
Vietnam<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:11.340> our<00:05:12.340> veteran<00:05:12.970> i<00:05:13.030> cant<00:05:13.240> rember

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
Vietnam and our veteran i cant rember

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.300 
Vietnam and our veteran i cant rember
what<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.660> is<00:05:13.780> i<00:05:13.900> think<00:05:13.930> it's<00:05:14.169> veteran<00:05:14.590> Vietnam

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
what it is i think it's veteran Vietnam

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.000 
what it is i think it's veteran Vietnam
anyway<00:05:15.700> if<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.330> put<00:05:16.510> it<00:05:16.600> on<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.750> most<00:05:17.010> difficult

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
anyway if I put it on the most difficult

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.850 
anyway if I put it on the most difficult
difficulty<00:05:18.750> part<00:05:19.750> about<00:05:19.870> repeating<00:05:20.290> myself<00:05:20.410> I

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
difficulty part about repeating myself I

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.850 
difficulty part about repeating myself I
think<00:05:21.310> it'll<00:05:21.580> make<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.880> more<00:05:22.150> interesting

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
think it'll make it more interesting

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.380 
think it'll make it more interesting
especially<00:05:23.860> because<00:05:24.430> I'll<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.640> alone<00:05:24.940> against

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
especially because I'll be alone against

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.080 
especially because I'll be alone against
nine<00:05:25.660> bots<00:05:26.070> which<00:05:27.070> are<00:05:27.280> maxed<00:05:27.850> up<00:05:27.970> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
nine bots which are maxed up the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.159 
nine bots which are maxed up the
difficulty<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:30.660> hopefully<00:05:31.660> i<00:05:31.690> will<00:05:31.930> get

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
difficulty and hopefully i will get

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.850 
difficulty and hopefully i will get
people<00:05:32.500> watch<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:33.010> because<00:05:33.550> my<00:05:34.419> videos<00:05:34.860> that

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
people watch it because my videos that

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.610 
people watch it because my videos that
i've<00:05:35.980> been<00:05:36.100> making<00:05:36.280> all<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:37.540> i<00:05:37.600> had<00:05:37.900> me<00:05:38.169> that
