00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 33 looks good so much 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.029
 betray 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.890
 and that on every platform though 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.610
 also has some technical problems 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.380
 to fight 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 which ones are and on which 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.460
 platform you are most likely to encounter 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.910
 our comparison of the versions for the pc 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.920
 the playstation 3 as well as the xbox 360 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.779
 we notice the platform comparison 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 everything on how similar the versions 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 for xbox and playstation are themselves in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 There are hardly any splitscreen side by side 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.820
 distinguish differences 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 Both console variants offer the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 same foresight and the same 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 Detail also the depth of blur is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.989
 similarly strong 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 only the color is a little different 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 the playstation version is saturated 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.280
 we xbox him right in the direct 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.590
 Comparing the pc version cuts something 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.260
 above all, the texture resolution is better 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 is much higher for push yourself 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 to see some shader effects like this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.559
 only late in the picture so that in this 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 If the appointment on the beach only after 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 a small delay is adjusted 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 not nice but that comes very rarely 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.409
 this is a weakness of many games 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 dynamic level of detail so how 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.920
 many details of an object in one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 certain distance still shown 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 become far cry 3 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 Exaggerates it with the saving of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 polygonal and defaced especially the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 tires of cars without reason we stand 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.990
 right in front of a car are the wheels 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 clean from modeled and above all 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 As soon as we reach a few meters 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 go back is the end and then there 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 corners and edges that one's poor 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.820
 Car drivers sorry can do the weird 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 even on a high end pc with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.079
 maximum details are suddenly lego 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.180
 cars, however, the effect of the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.310
 led customization to at least on the pc 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.799
 only with cars on the grass trees 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 rocks or other objects are on the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.270
 pc widely visible and do not knock 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 Disturbing the picture on the playstation 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.079
 or xbox, on the other hand, the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.030
 landscape only partially to the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.369
 leads to curious situations like these 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 yourself for shaping the stone or 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.420
 Trees are suddenly disappearing 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 when closer come back at the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.759
 remove again and so on and so on 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.829
 immediately 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.990
 synonymous with the shadow presentation attacks 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.090
 the level of detail system fades 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950
 far cry 3 on the consoles already after 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.599
 a little off 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.759
 then greatly simplified shadow 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.160
 while they are mostly identical on the pc 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.260
 stay again for comparison 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.819
 identical scene on the playstation and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.050
 the pc 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.180
 pay special attention to the missing 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.519
 shadow and the sparse vegetation in the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.440
 background of the console socket similar 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.450
 the handling of far cry is also strange 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.459
 3 with the cool wet because that looks 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.330
 Although chic but with the dynamics 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.180
 it does not get far 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.799
 so bowl bowls of appearance 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.560
 diamond-studded surface no matter on 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.269
 which platform is noticeable but at 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 the console fits the younger one 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.599
 Reflection of the water itself 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 Swimming does not move what he does 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.500
 we seem to fly through it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.660
 Also pay attention to this scene once 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 the reflection of the surface on 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.110
 the pc are the individual sheets as well 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.480
 the clouds are clearly visible 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.400
 with the xbox version, however, there are 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.099
 no more trees just static 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.130
 Reflection of the mountains and green gray 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.870
 pixel much to conclude show me one 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.269
 cat in the game again on the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.739
 console version and the pc version 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.110
 the differences are up to the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.720
 mentioned not emptied and whether they are to 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.060
 xbox 360 or the playstation 3-socket 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.340
 Tires lies solely on their preference 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.019
 for each platform graphical 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.720
 There are no differences 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.639
 the pc has the fancier mirroring 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.739
 as well as the less annoying strong 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.900
 emerging objects on the home page 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.790
 In addition, the game wins by the pc 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.410
 typical advantages like a higher one 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.720
 resolution and edge smoothing 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.370
 graphic quality, however, has that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.590
 its price because with edge smoothing 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.190
 already has a modern high end card 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 stuck in the calculator
