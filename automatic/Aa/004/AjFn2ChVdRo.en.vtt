00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello everyone today a new video of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.799
 information from the dragon movie 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.780
 ball z and I clarify them as I have already done 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.059
 this section of videos brings the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 real information as well as theories and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.610
 deny what is believed or images that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.810
 upload users and pass as real 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.400
 likewise they will always be shown and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 clarify what is real and what is not 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 clarified this we continue this time 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
 we will start with an image that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.930
 shared our friend Valentino Makoto 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.149
 minute in which we can appreciate in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 note of this newspaper that I suppose is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.070
 for otakus says that akira toriyama 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.530
 revealed that Boku will have another child 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 newspaper is very well designed and it would be 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.909
 credible the news but nevertheless 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 none of the official pages where 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.769
 come anime news reported nothing of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 that on the other hand you do not see any place 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.699
 that says they are in hull some image of the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 film or at least a sample of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 supposed new son besides that 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.510
 we know from the trailer of the movie 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 seeing the clothes of goku we can deduce 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.680
 that the movie will pass before the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 end of bbc is on television 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.500
 in those times goku were already considered 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.630
 to this 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 his suit was blue while 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.760
 in the trailer he still uses the color 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 orange and at the end of the dragon ball z no 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.290
 no other son of mouth is shown by 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.290
 what this note is false 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.429
 equally long ago that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.590
 published this note in a magazine which 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.569
 is one of the recognized magazines in that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.549
 country in this was put as a note 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.439
 main the rumors that there is about was 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.749
 the villain of the next installment of the 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.060
 movie be the same box as kakaroto 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.670
 although I've already talked a lot about it in 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 these videos that if you want to see them alone 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.049
 click on any of the images or on 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.899
 its defect in the description I leave the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.420
 playlist this same and 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.490
 as we said for this to happen , 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.409
 they should erase the memories of goku or 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.750
 avoid the blow that occurred in the head 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.629
 well while still being raised by wang 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.670
 the nature of the saints is wild and 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.129
 that blow was what helped a lot 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.989
 Boku to what it is today worth 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.060
 mention that after the creation of 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.890
 dragon ball minute and how is a 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.349
 kaka broken conscious and not a baby 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.209
 we can even more by the way of acting 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.340
 from this notice that he is not a child 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.510
 fully friendly as we saw it in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.760
 dragon ball 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.709
 now it is worth clarifying some points 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.989
 that very often they mentioned on the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.000
 movie these are that truth is not 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.069
 dead but he traveled to the past and for 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.980
 that can not be revived or that 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.569
 that can come out in the movie leaving 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.450
 aside that the work was not done by 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.849
 toriyama and let's say ok he went to the past 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.829
 is about 10,000 years in the past and if 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.799
 well he did not die for the dea goal of growing 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.310
 He must have died naturally, because he was in 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.170
 ssj god phase 2 I do something a little 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.750
 fool I can only think of one 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.390
 complete transformation more powerful not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.250
 only with a developing baby either 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.560
 I could be happy since I'm still 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 having sayano cells reviving 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.450
 it would only double its power and it would not go beyond 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.310
 a super sayayin 2 full to see besides 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 that you see in hell do not give 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.260
 time to train or something like that and 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.079
 Patrolman talking about jac칩 and dragon 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.989
 pl elvin I thought about the possible plot 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.970
 of the movie or rather partly as 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.239
 you have already given your theories I 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.010
 I will also give one of mine then 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.140
 if they saw the manga of goku's mother and 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.720
 they see that this is sent to earth 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.670
 in the last chapter from here to this one 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.500
 they entrust the mission of destroying 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.569
 goku ship heading to earth 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.490
 but before doing it he says he will see 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.310
 humanity and see if it's worth killing 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.230
 to shit to save them he knew 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.420
 to the brif and after much decided 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.820
 leave alive agoco as well as watch the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.770
 human and as we know everything went 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.320
 normal until this movie in which 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.720
 I think we could see appearing in it 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.270
 maybe helping in the plot or something by 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.400
 we can mention the style just like the 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.380
 people who think that kakaroto will revive 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.690
 create the theory that vegeta wrongly asks the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.880
 I wish and well they say that they ask to revive the 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.980
 kakaroto and without don confuses things and 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.140
 revive kakaroto al sayayin destructor 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.030
 but they forget that the one that comes out is the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.160
 dog and he can not revive someone else 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.079
 twice and if they mention that of na me 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.079
 I put it because he does not come out in the trailer 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.250
 also in dragon ball minute this 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.930
 page was the only one not translated from 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.060
 bz minute and a girl asked me 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
 translate it thanks to my help 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.050
 cousin here is the translation first 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.420
 panel from right to left 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.930
 we can not provide escape against the 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.449
 two is useless 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.080
 second you can also change the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.510
 future not only I from the center will live 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.170
 I will always return 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.790
 now let's continue with extra data 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.350
 for gmexico this news the most 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.750
 It is probable that you already know 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.270
 but on channel 5 they have re-enacted dragon 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.310
 ball z with the original voices and the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.380
 same kak치 I say casta침eda has 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.380
 posted several times on twitter 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.660
 these days mario casta침eda has been 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.610
 watching dragon ball z on channel 5 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.860
 mexico- these days and this is what he has done 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.990
 public on twitter until he shared a 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.480
 photo of soriana where he saw dragon ball z 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.420
 in 24 monitors 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.340
 remember to tune that channel from 9 30 to 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.350
 11 not only to support the dragon ball 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.360
 with which we grew up but to support the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.060
 encourage legal and so keep going more 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.880
 animes on open television likewise 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.980
 if like me they were curious how 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.080
 would be grohl and in no such not imagine more 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.880
