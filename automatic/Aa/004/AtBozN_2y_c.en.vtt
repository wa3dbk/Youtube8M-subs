00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
get it closed because I wanted to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.940 
get it closed because I wanted to
actually<00:03:00.430> rub<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.780> open<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.050> door<00:03:02.080> so

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
actually rub when you open the door so

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.860 
actually rub when you open the door so
it<00:03:03.010> keeps<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.220> nice<00:03:03.370> seal<00:03:03.670> with<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.330> floor<00:03:04.630> and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
it keeps a nice seal with the floor and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.630 
it keeps a nice seal with the floor and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
there's no no we're coming in the cracks

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970 
there's no no we're coming in the cracks
all<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.540> now<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.959> not<00:03:08.110> an<00:03:08.560> exact

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
all right now this is not an exact

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.100 
all right now this is not an exact
science<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.700> mean<00:03:10.330> anything<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.840> with<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
science I mean anything I do with the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.630 
science I mean anything I do with the
plastic<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.560> definitely<00:03:11.920> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.070> help<00:03:12.190> I'm

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
plastic is definitely going to help I'm

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.550 
plastic is definitely going to help I'm
not<00:03:12.790> trying<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.120> totally<00:03:13.900> precise<00:03:14.260> but

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
not trying to be totally precise but

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.440 
not trying to be totally precise but
again<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.700> another<00:03:15.760> reason<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.300> need<00:03:16.420> a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
again just another reason you need a

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.100 
again just another reason you need a
knife<00:03:16.600> that's<00:03:17.050> why<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.290> making<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.530> video

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110

so here we go I'm just could be doing a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.410 
so here we go I'm just could be doing a

so i enclose the porch with plastic the

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.699 
so i enclose the porch with plastic the
idea<00:05:51.189> behind<00:05:51.309> this<00:05:51.669> is<00:05:51.909> to<00:05:52.319> keep<00:05:53.319> the<00:05:53.469> draft

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
idea behind this is to keep the draft

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:57.899 
idea behind this is to keep the draft
out<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:54.129> those<00:05:54.939> cold<00:05:55.239> winter<00:05:56.199> winds<00:05:56.909> will

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
out and those cold winter winds will

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.149 
out and those cold winter winds will
it'll<00:05:58.389> basically<00:05:58.629> hit<00:05:59.110> out<00:05:59.229> here<00:05:59.589> and<00:05:59.800> even

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
it'll basically hit out here and even

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.029 
it'll basically hit out here and even
though<00:06:00.459> the<00:06:01.360> house<00:06:01.539> let's<00:06:02.319> say<00:06:02.469> inside<00:06:02.889> the

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
though the house let's say inside the

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.019 
though the house let's say inside the
other<00:06:03.189> will<00:06:03.339> be<00:06:03.429> other<00:06:03.550> side<00:06:03.729> of<00:06:03.759> that<00:06:03.849> wall

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
other will be other side of that wall

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.969 
other will be other side of that wall
obviously<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:05.229> house<00:06:05.379> will<00:06:05.559> be<00:06:05.589> nice<00:06:05.800> and

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
obviously the house will be nice and

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.989 
obviously the house will be nice and
warm<00:06:06.189> okay<00:06:07.029> and<00:06:07.589> the<00:06:08.589> cold<00:06:08.889> air<00:06:09.279> isn't<00:06:09.699> going

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:09.999 
warm okay and the cold air isn't going

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.329 
warm okay and the cold air isn't going
to<00:06:10.059> be<00:06:10.149> slamming<00:06:10.689> against<00:06:11.139> this<00:06:11.259> wall<00:06:11.529> okay

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
to be slamming against this wall okay

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.249 
to be slamming against this wall okay
you'll<00:06:12.519> be<00:06:12.610> hitting<00:06:12.759> on<00:06:12.939> the<00:06:13.029> plastic<00:06:13.419> so<00:06:13.989> in

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
you'll be hitting on the plastic so in

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.109 
you'll be hitting on the plastic so in
the<00:06:14.349> porch<00:06:14.619> it<00:06:14.799> won't<00:06:14.979> be<00:06:15.069> as<00:06:15.279> cold<00:06:15.459> as<00:06:15.759> outside

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:16.119 
the porch it won't be as cold as outside

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.179 
the porch it won't be as cold as outside
but<00:06:16.329> it<00:06:16.419> won't<00:06:16.539> be<00:06:16.599> as<00:06:16.779> warm<00:06:17.049> as<00:06:17.259> inside<00:06:17.619> but

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
but it won't be as warm as inside but

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:19.589 
but it won't be as warm as inside but
again<00:06:18.369> the<00:06:18.459> whole<00:06:18.549> idea<00:06:18.849> behind<00:06:19.029> this<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.419> to

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
again the whole idea behind this is to

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.540 
again the whole idea behind this is to
keep<00:06:19.809> the<00:06:19.929> house<00:06:20.079> warmer<00:06:20.589> and<00:06:20.739> to<00:06:21.159> not<00:06:21.279> lending

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
keep the house warmer and to not lending

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.209 
keep the house warmer and to not lending

drafts in as you know readily as it

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.029 
drafts in as you know readily as it
would<00:06:24.399> if<00:06:24.969> I<00:06:25.089> didn't<00:06:25.239> put<00:06:25.329> the<00:06:25.419> plastic<00:06:25.599> up<00:06:26.039> so

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
would if I didn't put the plastic up so

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.600 
would if I didn't put the plastic up so
this<00:06:27.369> project<00:06:27.789> cost<00:06:27.969> me<00:06:28.209> it<00:06:29.019> was<00:06:29.279> forty<00:06:30.279> seven

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
dollars for the role of plastic and took

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.399 
dollars for the role of plastic and took
about<00:06:34.379> yeah<00:06:35.379> 35<00:06:35.829> minutes<00:06:36.279> 40<00:06:36.550> minutes<00:06:36.579> to<00:06:36.879> do
