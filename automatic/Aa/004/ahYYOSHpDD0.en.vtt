00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
people can't downscale the stream so I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
people can't downscale the stream so I
know<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> people<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.540> terribly

know a lot of people have not terribly
great<00:01:22.259> internet<00:01:22.790> which<00:01:23.790> means<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> live

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
great internet which means when I live

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
great internet which means when I live
streaming<00:01:25.500> HD<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.640> can't<00:01:26.939> watch<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
streaming HD they can't watch it and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
streaming HD they can't watch it and
that<00:01:28.259> means<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.950> people<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.280> upset

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that means that people get very upset

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
that means that people get very upset
because<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.150> can't<00:01:30.329> watch<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> stream<00:01:30.780> but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
because they can't watch the stream but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
because they can't watch the stream but
when<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> live<00:01:31.860> stream<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> youtube<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.850> can

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
when it's live stream on youtube you can

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.749 
when it's live stream on youtube you can
like<00:01:33.890> get<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.130> stream<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> lower

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
like get it to stream and a lower

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.460 
like get it to stream and a lower
resolution<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.350> on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
resolution so it's going to be on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
resolution so it's going to be on
YouTube<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.549> issues<00:01:38.790> streaming<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> has

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
YouTube the issues streaming it has

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.770 
YouTube the issues streaming it has
improved<00:01:40.290> certainly<00:01:40.799> certainly<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.340> lot

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
improved certainly certainly a lot

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.969 
improved certainly certainly a lot
however<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.930> still<00:01:43.020> best<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.409> watch<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> on
