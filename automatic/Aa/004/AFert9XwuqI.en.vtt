00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.250 

well<00:00:32.210> that's<00:00:32.360> going<00:00:32.510> to<00:00:32.570> be<00:00:32.690> that's<00:00:32.990> going<00:00:33.170> to

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
well that's going to be that's going to

be<00:00:33.380> six<00:00:33.650> isn't<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.010> he's<00:00:34.130> my<00:00:34.370> ground<00:00:34.940> with<00:00:35.300> I

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
be six isn't it he's my ground with I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.740 
be six isn't it he's my ground with I
think<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.410> should<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.190> six<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:38.510> last

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
think that should be a six the last

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.119 
think that should be a six the last
point<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.140> contact

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.009 
point of contact
yeah<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.879> getting<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.449> changing

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
yeah I think it's getting it's changing

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.329 
yeah I think it's getting it's changing
now<00:00:43.199> or<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:45.320> he<00:00:46.320> touched<00:00:46.589> his<00:00:46.739> fluid<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
now or not he touched his fluid the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
other side of the rope and we'll hit the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240 
other side of the rope and we'll hit the
boundary<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.339> and<00:00:50.659> then<00:00:51.949> handle<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> balls

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
boundary right and then handle the balls

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.350 
boundary right and then handle the balls
that's<00:00:54.800> there's<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> wide<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> bonus

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's there's a wide so that's a bonus

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
that's there's a wide so that's a bonus
and<00:00:57.570> that'll<00:00:58.110> be<00:00:58.229> revisited<00:00:58.769> can<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and that'll be revisited can they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.090 
and that'll be revisited can they
revisit<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> now<00:01:00.019> they<00:01:01.019> can<00:01:01.260> revisit<00:01:01.589> on<00:01:01.949> Mitch

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
revisit it now they can revisit on Mitch

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
his last point of contact was over the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.100 
his last point of contact was over the
rope<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> right

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
rope as you can see he is on the right

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.139 
rope as you can see he is on the right
there<00:01:13.319> then<00:01:13.470> he's<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.759> then<00:01:14.880> he<00:01:14.940> /<00:01:15.060> then

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
there then he's over but then he / then

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.870 
there then he's over but then he / then
he<00:01:15.210> jumps<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:15.750> off<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> ground<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
he jumps up off the ground and then and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.180 
he jumps up off the ground and then and
then<00:01:18.030> taps<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.690> in<00:01:18.929> so<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.039> really

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
then taps it back in so I'm not really

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.389 
then taps it back in so I'm not really
sure<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.759> happens<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:22.069> suppose<00:01:23.069> if<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
sure what happens there I suppose if you

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:24.889 
sure what happens there I suppose if you
do<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> though<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> means<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.509> player<00:01:24.720> could

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
do that though that means a player could

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.960 
do that though that means a player could
actually<00:01:25.050> stand<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.800> fence<00:01:26.039> as<00:01:26.700> long<00:01:26.850> as

I<00:04:07.260> think<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:08.000> Shawn<00:04:09.000> Marsh<00:04:09.269> indeed<00:04:09.689> very

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
I think it is Shawn Marsh indeed very

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.949 
I think it is Shawn Marsh indeed very
cleverly<00:04:10.469> leaps<00:04:10.890> back<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:12.209> because<00:04:12.540> his<00:04:12.659> feet

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
cleverly leaps back but because his feet

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.539 
cleverly leaps back but because his feet
were<00:04:13.109> grounded<00:04:13.620> before<00:04:13.739> he<00:04:14.010> left<00:04:14.189> in<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.370> air

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
were grounded before he left in the air

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.580 
were grounded before he left in the air
to<00:04:14.700> parry<00:04:14.939> on<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.120> ball<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.959> has<00:04:16.109> been<00:04:16.289> judged

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
to parry on the ball it has been judged

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.140 
to parry on the ball it has been judged
as<00:04:16.769> six<00:04:17.009> and<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.459> think<00:04:17.669> they're<00:04:17.789> all<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
as six and I think they're all of the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.310 
as six and I think they're all of the
opinion<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.199> correct

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
opinion that that is the correct

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.810 
opinion that that is the correct
decision<00:04:21.740> another<00:04:22.740> look<00:04:22.979> at<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.190> very<00:04:23.340> sharp

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
decision another look at it very sharp

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
decision another look at it very sharp
thinking<00:04:24.120> by<00:04:24.449> Shawn<00:04:24.750> Marsh<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.410> in<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.460> end

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
thinking by Shawn Marsh but in the end

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.189 
thinking by Shawn Marsh but in the end
it<00:04:27.840> was<00:04:27.990> effective<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.530> he<00:04:28.680> might<00:04:28.860> have<00:04:29.039> hoped

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
it was effective as he might have hoped

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.060 
it was effective as he might have hoped
yeah<00:04:31.199> I<00:04:31.229> think<00:04:31.320> at<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> end<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.860> day<00:04:32.039> I

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
yeah I think at the end of the day I

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.590 
yeah I think at the end of the day I
think<00:04:32.490> justice<00:04:32.940> has<00:04:32.970> been<00:04:33.120> done

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
think justice has been done

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360 
think justice has been done
I'm<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.229> really<00:04:34.380> sure<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.919> laws<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
I'm not really sure in the laws of the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.839 
I'm not really sure in the laws of the
game<00:04:35.490> if<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.750> absolute<00:04:37.520> example<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.639> K

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
game if that absolute example is K

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.430 
game if that absolute example is K
before<00:04:39.060> but<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.509> bottom<00:04:39.750> line<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.930> he<00:04:40.169> took

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
before but the bottom line is he took

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.610 
before but the bottom line is he took
off<00:04:40.650> from<00:04:41.160> outside<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.180> area<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.539> play<00:04:42.660> the
