oh<00:02:18.590> well<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.959> was<00:02:21.959> kind<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.110> hoping<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.470> de

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
oh well I was kind of hoping for de

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.970 
oh well I was kind of hoping for de
Bourgh<00:02:22.739> oh<00:02:22.770> right<00:02:22.980> off<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> bat<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.580> no<00:02:24.390> luck

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.320 

hopefully<00:02:28.980> he'll<00:02:29.280> pop<00:02:29.489> up<00:02:29.520> before<00:02:29.970> things<00:02:30.150> get

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.880 
hopefully he'll pop up before things get
too<00:02:30.390> unfortunate

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.010 

because<00:02:35.610> boo<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:36.030> pretty<00:02:36.300> likely<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.690> kick<00:02:36.870> our

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
because boo is pretty likely to kick our

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.530 
because boo is pretty likely to kick our
ass<00:02:37.200> pretty<00:02:37.470> quick<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:39.360> state<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:42.240> that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
ass pretty quick in this state and that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.870 
ass pretty quick in this state and that
definitely<00:02:42.750> won't<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.230> de<00:02:43.410> Bourgh<00:02:43.590> oh<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:46.880> we

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
definitely won't be de Bourgh oh so we

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.230 
definitely won't be de Bourgh oh so we
will<00:02:48.090> gather<00:02:48.330> powers<00:02:48.990> oh<00:02:52.070> goody<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.120> we

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
will gather powers oh goody just so we

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.680 
will gather powers oh goody just so we
needed<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.630> guard<00:02:54.840> down

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.570 

that's<00:03:03.290> secretly<00:03:03.650> when<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.130> hoping<00:03:04.430> would

that's secretly when I was hoping would

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.680 
that's secretly when I was hoping would
happen

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.559 

just<00:03:15.760> because<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.090> don't<00:03:16.239> feel<00:03:16.299> like<00:03:16.450> letting

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
just because I don't feel like letting

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:27.680 
just because I don't feel like letting
them<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.959> 3<00:03:17.409> cc<00:03:19.530> whoops

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.480

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.520
