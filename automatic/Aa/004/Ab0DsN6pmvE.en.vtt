00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 and precisely on this same subject in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 this same delegation there is a school 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 that is practically falling to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.030
 pieces and the authorities have not yet 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.099
 done nothing to avoid an accident 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.590
 the federal primary school rafael 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.360
 ramirez castaÃ±eda located in the town 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.189
 of santa catarina in the delegation 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.560
 tlÃ¡huac is on the edge of 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.840
 collapse because it is in a zone of 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.939
 sinking risk the director of the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.980
 school affirmed that the authorities 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.050
 have attended but the reality is that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 are a few days away from starting 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.270
 classes and there is a significant backlog 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.700
 is in demolition in the media classroom 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 the concierge will also demolish the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.249
 the directions but the jobs go 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.960
 very very slow then I do not say that 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.510
 the authorities are not making us 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.449
 case if they are paying attention but they are very 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.920
 slow in the building where 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.770
 are the classrooms already presents a decline 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.710
 in the report that they give us that is still 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.590
 habitable but finally as they are 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.180
 happening the earthquakes are tremors 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.100
 this can cause us already a greater 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.920
 Affectation neighbors of the delegation 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.380
 tlahuac claim that more than 100 homes 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.090
 are affected by subsidence what 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 what is most worrying is a primary school 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 where more than 1,400 students are in 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.810
 danger because that primary is being 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.670
 falling to pieces the school in which 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.470
 there is an opinion issued by the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.050
 local infrastructure institute 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.970
 educational physics of the federal district in 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.520
 the one that indicates that the educational establishment 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.590
 he is sitting in an area of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.660
 risk of subsidence in such a way 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.940
 that the delegation itself has 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.950
 scheduled its demolition so it 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.560
 they are doing work of collapse in 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.990
 six of his classrooms however said 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.660
 jobs that started two months ago 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.320
 they are being carried out in a very 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.270
 slow then if the concern in the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 general level on the part of the parents is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.850
 3 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 it is great in fact every time there is an earthquake 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.740
 a small earthquake all parents are 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.280
 here next to the entrance the classes 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.470
 They start in a few weeks and the most 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.410
 1400 students will not have a school 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.480
 100% and with a latent risk that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.680
 by any modification of the earth 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.040
 or earthquake comes down reported fernando 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.040
