00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello to all subscribers now with us 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.530
 there will be a battle of figures top 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.850
 marvel select vs marvel torus 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.680
 legends ate marvel select cake on the right 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.109
 top here is marvel legends 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.250
 Torah from marvel select company releases 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.980
 daimon select torus marvel and johns 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.650
 released by the company hasbro 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.660
 how do you see the painting on the marvel figure 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.060
 legends is accurate i just eat of course 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.699
 some shade 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.160
 i.e. not a single color but marvel 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.350
 select made a little more interesting 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.030
 how would the effect even from above on power 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.489
 the lungs look like some kind of skin even 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:55.489
 they just look at plastic 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:59.090
 yourself select legends is also very noticeable 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.679
 difference is that this here is the armor here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.870
 with a blue tint there is just silver 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.170
 I really like the blue shade 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.380
 but this silver also looks very 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.380
 cool 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 Further outerwear as you can see here 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.430
 again two colors of such while here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.649
 cool folds cool painting more 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.899
 realistically something here on the marvel figure 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:35.119
 select but you can see it yourself 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.570
 cloaks are both good us effect a little 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.299
 darker while at marvel legends 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.659
 a little lighter and more solid 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.119
 rubber stripped cloak hair made 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.500
 interesting figures marvel legends because 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.039
 that no more detailed myself how much 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.720
 lanes more detailed let's 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.810
 Now let's take a look at them. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.450
 headwear for this helmet as you can see at marvel 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.539
 select solid silver color at 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.479
 while marvel and james have an effect 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.230
 such a metal painting that is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.160
 several colors used and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.890
 look like something is enough 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.320
 well of course we look at these 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.760
 Wings as you can see Margot's jeans are not 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.470
 less frost is not more 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.890
 the most interesting part is probably 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.540
 comparison of faces as you see in marvel 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.010
 legends very interestingly traced face 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.580
 while marvel select 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.830
 the face seems to be just riding at the figurine 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.080
 nonetheless from far away if you look at 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.120
 marvel select shelf looks great 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.630
 while mate and humidity are a bit 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 gremlin reminds me of some 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.400
 like both 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.400
 from the cult of weight 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.150
 here's a mod from marvel select that's supposedly from 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.780
 models jones 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.260
 this one looks more like some kind of stone 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.450
 hammer 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.870
 while this one has a metallic 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.230
 shade can also see the difference in 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.230
 sizes 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.290
 both are young and good and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.860
 can also from marvel legends 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.430
 hang on his belt while red 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.440
 you can't go to the marvel select figure 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.390
 but as you can see, marvel select has a handle 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.650
 stained 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.080
 Kumar's example is great the chance that just 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.790
 brown plastic also with a figurine 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.950
 marvel select comes a big stand 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.330
 which can be fixed on the wall at that 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 time as with marvel legends 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.800
 stand no figurine marvel select 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 standing quietly and without stand 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.790
 although it is bundled while 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.650
 figure marvel engine without stand 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 not very good she is not very 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.900
 steady if you doubt what 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.430
 you figure choose from these there 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.470
 several options as you know my 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.630
 favorite is to buy a hobby from everyone 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.280
 figurines have their advantages but I just 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.610
 like marvel select figures 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.220
 so closely I like this more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.750
 the figurine is 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.120
 while the figurine here is marvel 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.250
 legends also good, she more 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.530
 massive as you see muscle you guy 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.260
 although how do you see the sculpted muscle figures 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.660
 marvel select even for the item will not 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.640
 pull what triceps ok everyone 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.650
 Subscribers thanks for watching and for your 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.419
 Like write in the comments as you 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 such videos in comparison mode 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.860
 probably worth doing further of course 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.289
 it will be more interesting it was 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.289
 experimental video all world
