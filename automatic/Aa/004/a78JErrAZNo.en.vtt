they are scientifically wrong there is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.800 
they are scientifically wrong there is
one<00:00:25.019> big<00:00:25.740> highlight<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.970> then

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
one big highlight of this and then

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.109 
one big highlight of this and then
that's<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.730> pick<00:00:29.970> up

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that's really about it so you pick up

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
that's really about it so you pick up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
Drake will take us to Hyjal as to why

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
Drake will take us to Hyjal as to why
they<00:00:59.640> did<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.329> opposed<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> us<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
they did that as opposed to us just

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.540 
they did that as opposed to us just
getting<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> flying<00:01:01.829> mountain<00:01:02.250> flying

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
getting on a flying mountain flying

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
getting on a flying mountain flying
there<00:01:02.850> cuz<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> far

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
there cuz it's really not all that far

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
there cuz it's really not all that far
away<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:05.549> where<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.780> Orgrimmar<00:01:06.990> at

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
away from where we are in Orgrimmar at

away from where we are in Orgrimmar at
any<00:01:07.439> rate<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> really<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
any rate I really do not know but I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
any rate I really do not know but I
suppose<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> benefit<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> the

suppose this is for the benefit of the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.880 
suppose this is for the benefit of the

in<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.490> you'll<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> texture<00:01:18.299> work

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
in that you'll see the texture work

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.090 
in that you'll see the texture work
around<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> garbage<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.860> there's<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and I certainly do desire because this
