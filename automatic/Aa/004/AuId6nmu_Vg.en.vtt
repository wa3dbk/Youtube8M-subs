00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:19.939
 so people welcome to a very 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:23.489
 heavy round 4 bet wars are multi 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.779
 play and are a violence because 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.860
 any reason I am suddenly 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 clamp mentor strange 255 and off 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.380
 any reason regenerations p55 me 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.050
 do not know why it seems like a bug who 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 I know it and by chance it is like that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.589
 I beat people with the hand that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.179
 instant a coincidence of that 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.719
 so it happens that there are also random ones 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.339
 coincidences 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.629
 but I would say she likes him 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.010
 Of course, then there is also want 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 benefit from it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 that works now so the tactic that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 If I happen to happen that too 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 you just can then in the shop 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.269
 go recover just eat because of that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.570
 you still need a pickaxe 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.519
 bell 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.409
 which also needed still to 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.400
 we can make a trick easy 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 owe is also to have armor 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.070
 always does as you only hear for the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.350
 It's all about instant 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.829
 I'll just show you how I start 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.130
 now here and so death than ever makes 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.130
 I am also afraid 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.189
 and yes, definitely one 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 difficult round people i think so 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.500
 I already work the gameplay 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.759
 dead for three hours I guess 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.299
 Watch if we win this round 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.850
 can 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.810
 It is hard to find it almost impossible 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 namely a foreign substance 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.719
 but that is not a problem game mode 1 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.149
 we can not rock and die 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.030
 play game to zero 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.149
 and we are back in the race again 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.219
 can not even wanted to die so 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:59.689
 I wish even with these little ones 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.689
 advantage completely and then die hello 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.719
 I've got more in the wheelchair when I'm 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719
 strongly 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:17.819
 hello hello so game fashion 129 pieces 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 my case completely harms 0 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.620
 and again they all want to vacate 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:43.970
 you know the tip of game and 1 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:43.970
 triumph was a game and 1 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:55.049
 the line-up rey but we notice opaque 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.890
 the defense is tough you want 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.470
 but you see how you see effect 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.579
 There are many more ways for us 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.410
 to gain advantage 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.410
 we can possibly do a jumps 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.670
 give the our imagination far so 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:15.950
 The super champion should actually us 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.950
 were just 10 19 I have now 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.389
 the other way around 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.389
 the other way 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.860
 so here we come now the people 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.720
 Possibly possibly yes in 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.540
 the others easier to come by 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.460
 that works so jump and land 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.200
 and we also arranged everything 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.940
 we see a strong defense 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.000
 we can just use one here 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.180
 newer but a few difficulties 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.560
 circumnavigate 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.660
 Who else has the opportunity 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.120
 obstacles easily skip 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.920
 we see our opponents are these 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.280
 completely without chance since we the bed 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.480
 can degrade alpha and that's what we have 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.760
 already team blue completely sorted out 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.540
 my same one that is a willing one 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.290
 Ok , I have a heavy reason I hope 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.360
 we can still win that more so 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.580
 see it is the yellow that is a 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.260
 friendlier but we have seen that 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.670
 Team Green is the battery and we were not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.830
 should pass and not easy 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.480
 We wanted to win 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.420
 but no problem as we see is so 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.500
 a charlatan down here and read 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.970
 we can just skip that 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.260
 he goes under the boy there runs the 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.680
 boy that came over 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.200
 but as we know we can just 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.050
 jump here they are all there 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.900
 stand zack zack zack zack 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.280
 well I think I have now the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.889
 was a difficult thing that you too 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.330
 create 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.550
 yes I do not know that has diligently no 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.550
 I do not have 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.780
 jump xxl away so now after roth yes 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.879
 So I hope the recording will 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 finally what many try many 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.330
 try here so far are anything 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.280
 that they are all good people are there 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.340
 good people people people are good 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.810
 happy people multi is right each 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.819
 freedom that's not true i'll show you 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.669
 no matter what liberty says there you see 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:18.539
 you are a freedom and hard working 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:24.270
 hello down there are three very nice ones 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:25.580
 mens hello we get to see 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.400
 behind hand 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:35.340
 hopp there as you only the direction 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.789
 place in ok difficult round difficult 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.580
 round 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.300
 I think if you get the kids out of here 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.409
 then you manage that too it was up 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.960
 every case hard 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.270
 I gave my best I hope 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.400
 you are satisfied with recording if you 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.340
 further challenger stable for example 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.930
 because it already you have to just 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.060
 imagine you have generation 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.969
 wins first that is completely 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.930
 impossible to approach in any way 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:06.960
 yes I think you guys 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.970
 the same way that it is here 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.520
 should give the kick that happens 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.449
 also these are bugs the lectures 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.479
 can that moderator get that 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.940
 a round something 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.500
 I'll be like that in every video from now on 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.330
 check off 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.419
 I hope you like that if not 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.699
 then you have to like it and we'll see 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.740
 us something difficult at the next video 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.599

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.160
 countries also rowling I do not know 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.000
 You can also do difficult trubels in the 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.690
 Write comments
