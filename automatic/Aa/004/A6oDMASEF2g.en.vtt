 it seems that on the screen of the smartphone lumia 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.320
 930 has a problem with white balance 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:37.970
 the snow is kind of brown 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.850
 organization is better Klin or 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.850
 the american 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 try to focus on iphone 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.620
 instantly generally unnoticed as 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.220
 rebuild focus iphone ulema 930 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.180
 much slow and the process itself is visible 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.180
 to the naked eye 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.280

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.970

 how was 30 so left but that iphone 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.900
 No, and I can immediately say that much 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 less smoothly, he began to shoot with 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.610
 it seems and stabilization was not so 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.299
 good but of course you have to look at 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.769
 computer then on board 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.769
