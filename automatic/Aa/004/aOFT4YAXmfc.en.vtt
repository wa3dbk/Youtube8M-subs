hi<00:00:06.029> welcome<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.750> lesson<00:00:06.930> 5<00:00:07.649> now<00:00:08.219> I'd<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:08.850> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
hi welcome to lesson 5 now I'd like to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.910 
hi welcome to lesson 5 now I'd like to
talk<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.510> about<00:00:09.600> the<00:00:09.900> concept<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.559> shape

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
talk to you about the concept of shape

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.289 
talk to you about the concept of shape
now<00:00:11.490> shape<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.180> a<00:00:12.209> combination<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.969> your<00:00:14.969> jaw

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
now shape is a combination of your jaw

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.679 
now shape is a combination of your jaw
and<00:00:15.690> your<00:00:15.750> tongue<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:18.150> muscles<00:00:18.509> of<00:00:18.660> your

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
and your tongue and the muscles of your

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.390 
and your tongue and the muscles of your
face<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.349> most<00:00:20.220> importantly<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:22.250> muscles<00:00:23.250> at

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
face and most importantly the muscles at

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
face and most importantly the muscles at
the<00:00:23.430> corners<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> aperture<00:00:25.080> now<00:00:25.410> there's

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the corners of the aperture now there's

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730 
the corners of the aperture now there's
always<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> different<00:00:28.140> ideas<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
always a lot of different ideas as to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
always a lot of different ideas as to
what<00:00:29.130> corners<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.789> some<00:00:30.060> people<00:00:30.330> think

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
what corners are some people think

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.970 
what corners are some people think
corners<00:00:30.900> are<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.260> some<00:00:31.560> people<00:00:31.679> think

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
corners are here some people think

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
corners are here some people think
corners<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> corners<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
corners are here or or the corners of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950 
corners are here or or the corners of
the<00:00:33.690> aperture<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.170> doesn't<00:00:34.440> matter<00:00:34.670> what<00:00:35.960> how

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the aperture it doesn't matter what how

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.030 
the aperture it doesn't matter what how
you<00:00:37.019> think<00:00:37.379> about<00:00:37.409> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you think about it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.060 
you think about it
they're<00:00:38.400> all<00:00:38.610> fine<00:00:39.330> it's<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:39.960> word<00:00:40.170> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
they're all fine it's just the word but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.509 
they're all fine it's just the word but
what<00:00:41.339> changes<00:00:42.120> pitch<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.659> the<00:00:42.780> instrument<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
what changes pitch on the instrument is

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.420 
what changes pitch on the instrument is
the<00:00:44.519> tension<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:46.290> very<00:00:46.650> corners<00:00:47.159> of<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the tension at the very corners of the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.869 
the tension at the very corners of the
aperture<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> mouthpiece<00:00:48.720> sets

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
aperture where the mouthpiece sets

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.719 
aperture where the mouthpiece sets
there's<00:00:50.879> no<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.540> change<00:00:52.440> pitch<00:00:52.920> without

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
there's no way to change pitch without

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.189 
there's no way to change pitch without
changing<00:00:54.479> shape<00:00:56.330> there's<00:00:57.330> a<00:00:57.449> generally

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
changing shape there's a generally

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.490 
changing shape there's a generally
accepted<00:00:58.830> idea<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.869> have<00:01:01.049> to<00:01:01.199> blow

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
accepted idea that you have to blow

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.530 
accepted idea that you have to blow
harder<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> squeeze<00:01:02.400> your<00:01:02.580> lips<00:01:02.760> together<00:01:02.970> to

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
harder and squeeze your lips together to

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.679 
harder and squeeze your lips together to
play<00:01:03.780> higher<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:06.090> less<00:01:06.450> air

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
play higher now there's less air

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.600 
play higher now there's less air
traveling<00:01:07.200> through<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> instrument<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
traveling through the instrument as you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.920 
traveling through the instrument as you
get<00:01:08.790> higher<00:01:09.020> yet<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.320> innate<00:01:10.860> desire<00:01:11.370> is<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
get higher yet our innate desire is to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.440 
get higher yet our innate desire is to
push<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.650> air<00:01:13.680> through<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.610> defies<00:01:15.120> logic

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
push more air through that defies logic

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
push more air through that defies logic
but<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.260> we<00:01:16.410> do<00:01:16.590> naturally<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> trick

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but it's what we do naturally the trick

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
but it's what we do naturally the trick
to<00:01:20.250> increasing<00:01:20.670> range<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> trumpet<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to increasing range on the trumpet is to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
to increasing range on the trumpet is to
start<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> recognize<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.790> sensation<00:01:24.480> of

start and recognize the sensation of
shape<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:26.390> recognize<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.290> tongue<00:01:28.560> is

getting your air out and up you're going

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.139 
getting your air out and up you're going
to<00:02:07.110> stop<00:02:07.500> rolling<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.159> bottom<00:02:08.489> lip<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.879> which

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to stop rolling that bottom lip in which

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.080 
to stop rolling that bottom lip in which
is<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> big<00:02:10.019> problem

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
is the big problem

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.990 
is the big problem
as<00:02:11.840> soon<00:02:12.019> as<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.290> lip<00:02:12.680> starts<00:02:12.950> rolling<00:02:13.430> back

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
as soon as that lip starts rolling back

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.630 
as soon as that lip starts rolling back
under<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.980> tightens<00:02:15.980> up<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.340> you've<00:02:16.430> got<00:02:16.550> to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
under it tightens up and you've got to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.550 
under it tightens up and you've got to
blow<00:02:16.849> really<00:02:17.150> hard<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.200> come<00:02:18.530> out

note and that's where that all that
internal<00:02:22.879> tension<00:02:23.330> comes<00:02:23.690> from<00:02:23.989> when<00:02:24.650> you're

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
internal tension comes from when you're

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.670 
internal tension comes from when you're
attempting<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.400> play<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:26.120> higher<00:02:26.510> note<00:02:26.810> now

again<00:02:28.220> if<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.640> repeat<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.750> there's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
again if I repeat to you that there's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.809 
again if I repeat to you that there's
less<00:02:30.170> air<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:30.680> through<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.040> instrument<00:02:31.580> as

less air going through the instrument as

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.059 
less air going through the instrument as
you<00:02:32.000> get<00:02:32.180> higher<00:02:32.560> you'll<00:02:33.560> learn<00:02:33.769> that<00:02:33.950> if

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
you get higher you'll learn that if

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.559 
you get higher you'll learn that if
you've<00:02:34.190> got<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.580> compression<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.360> body

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
you've got the compression in the body

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.979 
you've got the compression in the body
which<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.170> comes<00:02:36.379> from<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> backswing

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
which just comes from the backswing

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.270 
which just comes from the backswing
there's<00:02:38.989> energy<00:02:39.319> in<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.709> upper<00:02:39.739> body<00:02:40.069> you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
there's energy in the upper body you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.130 
there's energy in the upper body you
support<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.940> then<00:02:41.330> if<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.540> release<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.110> air

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.289 
but don't try and blow too much through
you<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.739> need<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.700> correct<00:02:47.060> shape

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
you just need to have the correct shape

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.020 
you just need to have the correct shape
and<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.810> lip<00:02:48.110> that's<00:02:48.290> not<00:02:48.500> tired<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.790> upper

to<00:02:54.920> think<00:02:55.130> about<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.400> guitar<00:02:55.819> string<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
to think about a guitar string for a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.009 
to think about a guitar string for a
moment<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:57.730> loose<00:02:58.730> string<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.660> going<00:02:59.900> to

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
moment a loose string is going to

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.860 
moment a loose string is going to
resonate<00:03:00.739> at<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.129> lower<00:03:01.310> frequency<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:02.239> tighter

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.520 
string is going to resonate at a higher
frequency<00:03:04.720> now<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.780> don't<00:03:05.959> have<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.200> hit<00:03:06.349> that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
we're trying to blow harder which means

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.890 
we're trying to blow harder which means

now there's numerous methods around that
talk<00:03:37.069> about<00:03:37.370> tongue<00:03:38.060> shaped<00:03:38.389> ie<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:40.310> know

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
talk about tongue shaped ie and I know

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.000 
talk about tongue shaped ie and I know
if<00:03:40.519> he<00:03:40.639> is<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.940> didn't<00:03:41.180> quite<00:03:41.329> understand<00:03:41.810> it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
if he is I didn't quite understand it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.140 
if he is I didn't quite understand it
but<00:03:43.010> when<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.340> put<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.669> whole<00:03:43.700> picture

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
but when you put the whole picture

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.409 
but when you put the whole picture
together<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:46.370> understand<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.120> tongue

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
together and you understand that tongue

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.120 
together and you understand that tongue
is<00:03:47.569> connected<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.049> jaw<00:03:48.349> which<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.709> connected

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
is connected to jaw which is connected

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.190 
is connected to jaw which is connected
to<00:03:49.160> facial<00:03:49.579> muscles<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.150> you've<00:03:50.870> got<00:03:51.049> your

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
to facial muscles and you've got your

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.050 
to facial muscles and you've got your
ear<00:03:51.380> onboard<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.950> start<00:03:52.220> directing<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.880> air

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
ear onboard you start directing the air

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.309 
ear onboard you start directing the air
forward<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.019> up<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.590> get<00:03:58.599> so<00:03:59.599> your<00:03:59.810> tongue<00:04:00.049> is

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
forward and up you get so your tongue is

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.780 
forward and up you get so your tongue is
arching<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.930> lowering<00:04:03.280> arching<00:04:04.280> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
arching and lowering arching and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.050 
arching and lowering arching and
lowering<00:04:05.410> now<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.650> not<00:04:06.950> just<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.459> raising

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
lowering now it's not just the raising

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.059 
lowering now it's not just the raising
of<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.180> tongue<00:04:08.569> that's<00:04:09.290> making<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> air<00:04:09.889> go

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
of the tongue that's making the air go

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.620 
of the tongue that's making the air go
faster<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.700> changes<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.180> pitch<00:04:11.359> that's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
faster that changes the pitch that's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.159 
faster that changes the pitch that's
another<00:04:12.130> generally<00:04:13.130> accepted<00:04:13.519> idea<00:04:14.169> what's

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
another generally accepted idea what's

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.719 
another generally accepted idea what's
happening<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:16.539> it's<00:04:17.539> firming<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.530> muscles<00:04:18.729> of

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
happening is it's firming the muscles of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
that change now if you can learn to hold

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
that there and not over blow you'll

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.809 
that there and not over blow you'll

try it out now to demonstrate how this
works<00:04:46.919> we<00:04:47.159> go<00:04:47.340> through<00:04:47.610> all<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.849> steps<00:04:48.060> that

works we go through all the steps that
we've<00:04:48.419> done<00:04:48.599> so<00:04:48.780> far

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
we've done so far

change the pitch by using my air it's
