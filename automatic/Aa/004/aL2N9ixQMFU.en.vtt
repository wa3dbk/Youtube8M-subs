condition<00:00:07.020> called<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.529> winged<00:00:07.680> scapula<00:00:08.100> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
condition called the winged scapula a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
condition called the winged scapula a
wet<00:00:08.910> scapula<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.480> basically<00:00:09.809> when<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.290> of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
wet scapula is basically when one of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
wet scapula is basically when one of
your<00:00:10.469> shoulder<00:00:10.769> blades<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.490> thinking<00:00:11.880> out

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
your shoulder blades it's thinking out

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
your shoulder blades it's thinking out
more<00:00:12.269> than<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.480> should<00:00:12.510> if<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
drawing here I have a drawing of a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.730 
drawing here I have a drawing of a
person's<00:00:15.240> back<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.320> neck<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
person's back this is the neck the

person's back this is the neck the
shoulders<00:00:17.189> and<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.610> is<00:00:17.759> the<00:00:17.849> mid-back<00:00:18.210> area

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
shoulders and this is the mid-back area

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
shoulders and this is the mid-back area
these<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.619> represent<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> shoulder

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
these two here represent the shoulder

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.450 
these two here represent the shoulder
blades<00:00:20.840> normally<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.440> scapula<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.100> against

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
blades normally the scapula are against

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.210 
blades normally the scapula are against
the<00:00:23.580> rib<00:00:24.060> cage<00:00:24.270> here<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.779> there's<00:00:25.619> no<00:00:25.800> problem

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the rib cage here and there's no problem

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
the rib cage here and there's no problem
however<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.029> winged<00:00:27.240> scapula<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.320> both

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
however in a winged scapula one or both

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160 
however in a winged scapula one or both
of<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:28.949> protruding<00:00:29.550> outwards<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of them are protruding outwards and that

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
of them are protruding outwards and that
can<00:00:31.410> cause<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> problem<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.220> person<00:00:32.519> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
can cause a problem for the person it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.729 
can cause a problem for the person it
can<00:00:32.699> cause<00:00:32.879> discomfort<00:00:33.269> it<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.170> cause<00:00:34.379> pain

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
can cause discomfort it can cause pain

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.079 
can cause discomfort it can cause pain
when<00:00:34.979> they're<00:00:35.070> sitting<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.519> a<00:00:35.640> chair<00:00:35.820> because

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
when they're sitting in a chair because

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.990 
when they're sitting in a chair because
that<00:00:36.269> scapula<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> hitting<00:00:37.080> first<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.640> lot

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that scapula is hitting first and a lot

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.820 
that scapula is hitting first and a lot
of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.150> things<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.839> we<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.199> this<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
of the things that we see with this is

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.490 
of the things that we see with this is
that<00:00:41.100> people<00:00:41.570> have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> problem<00:00:43.019> also<00:00:43.170> with

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that people have a problem also with

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.289 
that people have a problem also with
their<00:00:43.680> shoulder<00:00:43.979> move<00:00:44.159> offenses<00:00:44.549> since<00:00:45.150> the

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
their shoulder move offenses since the

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.450 
their shoulder move offenses since the
scapula<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.720> part<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.049> the<00:00:46.110> shoulder<00:00:46.530> joint<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
scapula is part of the shoulder joint it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.520 
scapula is part of the shoulder joint it
can<00:00:47.699> inhibit<00:00:48.059> normal<00:00:48.870> motion<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> joint

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
can inhibit normal motion of the joint

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.729 
can inhibit normal motion of the joint
area<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.549> is<00:00:50.729> caused<00:00:51.030> by<00:00:51.659> lesion<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
area now this is caused by lesion to the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
area now this is caused by lesion to the
long<00:00:52.920> thoracic<00:00:53.430> nerve<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:53.940> innervates<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
long thoracic nerve which innervates the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500 
long thoracic nerve which innervates the
Serena's<00:00:55.559> anterior<00:00:56.250> muscle<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.150> Serena's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
Serena's anterior muscle the Serena's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.359 
Serena's anterior muscle the Serena's
anterior<00:00:57.989> muscle<00:00:58.320> basically<00:00:58.769> starts<00:00:59.129> over

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
anterior muscle basically starts over

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:00.979 
anterior muscle basically starts over
here<00:00:59.400> on<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.699> bottom<00:00:59.790> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.119> ribcage<00:01:00.299> on<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
here on the bottom of the ribcage on the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.479 
here on the bottom of the ribcage on the
side<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.409> ribcage<00:01:01.589> I<00:01:01.860> would<00:01:02.040> say<00:01:02.190> right

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
side of the ribcage I would say right

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
side of the ribcage I would say right
below<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.970> chest<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.869> it<00:01:04.049> goes<00:01:04.199> around<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
below the chest and it goes around the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880 
below the chest and it goes around the
back<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> ribcage<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.990> below<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
back of the ribcage and it's below the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
back of the ribcage and it's below the
scapula<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.759> when<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> muscle<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.659> affected

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
scapula so when that muscle is affected

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
scapula so when that muscle is affected
the<00:01:10.770> ribcage<00:01:11.009> basically<00:01:11.909> protrudes<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the ribcage basically protrudes out so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
the ribcage basically protrudes out so
in<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> video<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:14.009> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> show<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.460> five

at home so you can get the scapula back

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
at home so you can get the scapula back
where<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.530> supposed<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.429> can<00:01:20.609> have
