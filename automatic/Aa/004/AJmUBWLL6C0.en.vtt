00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
yeah the boats still kind of bad I don't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.690 
yeah the boats still kind of bad I don't
like<00:00:30.779> every<00:00:31.529> bow<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.980> every<00:00:32.250> texture<00:00:32.579> pack

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
like every bow on every texture pack

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
like every bow on every texture pack
always<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> bad<00:00:33.360> string<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
always has a bad string on it but it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.270 
always has a bad string on it but it's
whatever<00:00:34.739> um<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.530> let's<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
whatever um so let's get right into it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860 
whatever um so let's get right into it
first<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> paintings<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
first off we got all the paintings that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770 
first off we got all the paintings that
are<00:00:39.960> exactly<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> same<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
are exactly the same so just more I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.440 
are exactly the same so just more I
guess<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.860> texture<00:00:44.250> pack<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.730> known<00:00:45.210> as

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
guess this texture pack is just known as

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.930 
guess this texture pack is just known as
being<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.960> crisp<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.710> clear<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.280> guess<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
being more crisp and clear I guess you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
being more crisp and clear I guess you
can<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.629> everything<00:00:49.050> looks

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
can say that because everything looks

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.939 
can say that because everything looks
more<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.739> guess<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.489> HD<00:00:50.700> texture<00:00:51.329> pack

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
more I guess it's a more HD texture pack

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.510 
more I guess it's a more HD texture pack
so<00:00:52.949> oh<00:00:53.129> there's<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.760> arrow<00:00:53.969> oh<00:00:55.039> whoops<00:00:56.129> um<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so oh there's my arrow oh whoops um I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
so oh there's my arrow oh whoops um I
don't<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.570> was

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
don't know what that was right that was

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
don't know what that was right that was
probably<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.620> long<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.129> ago<00:00:59.309> actually
