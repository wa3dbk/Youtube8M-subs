00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello today I would like to teach you how 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.650
 take advantage of your brother's shirts 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:16.809
 your father your husband 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.809
 of some shirt that does not want 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.600
 these shirts we as the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.600
 winners I'll show you how the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.890
 we can make a blouse that we see 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.310
 all right 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.879
 with a special marker for clothing what 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.190
 what we are going to do is mark giving shape 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.780
 to our blouse 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.780
 we are doing this 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.039
 the next 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.519
 will do a sewing to this part and 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.250
 make a little bend here all the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.070
 shore of what it represents to be 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 our sleeve 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 here we set it 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.610
 we mark it and we pass it through the machine 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.490
 we already made the sewing here of all the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.400
 edge of the sleeves and the part that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.200
 we had 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 cut here to the sides now it 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.690
 it may look like this if you want a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.470
 Sleeveless blouse can now be reserved 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.010
 the sleeves for something else 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.120
 and leave it like this a sleeveless blouse but 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.240
 in case you prefer to use the sleeves 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.750
 as I am going to explain to you then look 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.410
 let's go open a shirt 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.410
 unbuttoned 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.869
 we turn it around and then we take care that it does not 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.869
 we are left on one side or the other 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.420
 we will be fine 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.940
 we accommodate and use mostly here 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.900
 on the shoulder and we put together here what is 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.900
 can of manga 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.930
 we hold again with the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 pins 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.640
 now spend in a seam around here and 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.640
 I'll do the other sleeve now I show you 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.760
 we are going to see that the sleeves remain 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.330
 equal of the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.860
 I'm already holding it with the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:26.760
 pins and now I'll cut inside 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.760
 as we did with the other 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.430
 I'm going to cut and now I show you how to 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.430
 will do 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.379
 As I was saying , we will now refine this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.080
 part here inside what we 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.269
 We'll finish cutting it already with 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.000
 be careful so that this does not remain for us 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.870
 inside and bother us let's go little to 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.269
 little bit 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.269
 and flush with the seam 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.880
 now if we already remove the rest of what 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.040
 we had too much 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.040
 we do the same with the other sleeve 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.970
 and here we have our blouse 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.570
 it will end as you can see what is the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.600
 spring has been elastic marks us very 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.700
 well the silhouette for this helps us 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.890
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.400
 this idea the way to recycle 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.560
 shirts that go leaving your 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.160
 known either your father your brother you 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.690
 Boy, see you next time, you know, 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.320
 Any doubt or suggestion or comment 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.020
 they can leave down here in the 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.330
 comments and I will gladly 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.330
