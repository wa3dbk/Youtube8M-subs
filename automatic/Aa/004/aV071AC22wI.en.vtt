00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the eye makeup and these are pretty much

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
the eye makeup and these are pretty much
kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> barrier<00:01:08.430> protection<00:01:09.090> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
kind of like a barrier protection so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
kind of like a barrier protection so
that<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> doesn't<00:01:10.049> happen<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.530> quickly<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.620 
that that doesn't happen as quickly so
that's<00:01:11.549> pretty<00:01:11.700> much<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.119> claim<00:01:12.420> they

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
know no smudging or creasing that's
quickly<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.270> difference<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:19.110> two

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
quickly the difference between these two

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800

other<00:01:39.090> sites<00:01:39.420> online<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.930> sure<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.290> find

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
other sites online I'm sure you can find

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
other sites online I'm sure you can find
out<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.400> elf<00:01:41.700> mineral<00:01:41.970> eye<00:01:42.210> primary

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
out but with the elf mineral eye primary

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
out but with the elf mineral eye primary
I<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.290> find<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
I think you can only find this on that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
I think you can only find this on that
website<00:01:44.280> eyes<00:01:44.729> lips<00:01:44.970> face<00:01:45.090> comm<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
website eyes lips face comm so there is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
website eyes lips face comm so there is
a<00:01:46.979> big<00:01:47.430> difference<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> pricing<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> these

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
a big difference in the pricing of these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
a big difference in the pricing of these
two<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.409> believe<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.700> less

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
two I believe that there are less

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060 
two I believe that there are less
ingredients<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> elf<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.920> they

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
ingredients in the elf one you know they

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
ingredients in the elf one you know they
say<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.399> aren't<00:01:53.520> any<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.909> pure

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
say there aren't any like pure

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.960 
say there aren't any like pure
in<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> sense<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
in it so in a sense it's more of a

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.590 
in it so in a sense it's more of a
natural<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.020> primer

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.270 

so<00:02:05.320> those<00:02:05.470> are<00:02:05.590> just<00:02:05.620> some<00:02:05.860> really<00:02:06.040> quick

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
so those are just some really quick

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.040 
so those are just some really quick
facts<00:02:06.580> about<00:02:06.700> these<00:02:07.000> just<00:02:07.330> let<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.659> know<00:02:07.780> what

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
facts about these just let you know what

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.220 
facts about these just let you know what
I<00:02:08.229> primers<00:02:08.860> are<00:02:09.399> supposed<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.820> do<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.990> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
I primers are supposed to do and just a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.230 
I primers are supposed to do and just a
quick<00:02:11.410> comparison<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:12.490> these<00:02:12.670> two<00:02:12.910> I'll

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
quick comparison of these two I'll

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.699 
quick comparison of these two I'll
report<00:02:13.510> back<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.870> guys<00:02:13.930> later<00:02:14.170> after

report back to you guys later after
however<00:02:15.370> many<00:02:15.550> hours<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.840> find<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.320> both

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
however many hours when I find that both

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
however many hours when I find that both
of<00:02:17.740> these<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.340> creased<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.120> I'll<00:02:19.450> let<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
of these have creased and I'll let you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.540 
of these have creased and I'll let you
know<00:02:19.959> which<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.770> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.040> held<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.400> better

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
know which one kind of held up better

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:31.680 
know which one kind of held up better
which<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.450> hold<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.750> longer<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.830> stages<00:02:30.690> okay

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
which one hold up longer and stages okay

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.570 
which one hold up longer and stages okay
so<00:02:31.750> let's<00:02:32.080> apply<00:02:32.200> Urban<00:02:32.920> Decay<00:02:33.190> primer<00:02:33.400> potion

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
so let's apply Urban Decay primer potion

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:54.200 
so let's apply Urban Decay primer potion
to<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.330> eye

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.490 

and<00:02:55.210> then<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.720> apply<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.020> elf

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
and then I'm going to apply the elf

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:25.979 
and then I'm going to apply the elf
mineral<00:02:56.860> eye<00:02:57.220> primer<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.060> eye

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.300 

right<00:03:26.989> off<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.140> bat<00:03:27.409> I<00:03:27.650> noticed<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:28.129> there's

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
right off the bat I noticed that there's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.890 
right off the bat I noticed that there's
couple<00:03:28.549> more<00:03:28.700> color<00:03:28.940> pigmentation<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
couple more color pigmentation to the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.050 
couple more color pigmentation to the
alpha<00:03:30.230> line<00:03:30.349> compared<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.370> DPP<00:03:31.819> the

alpha line compared to the you DPP the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.809

Urban<00:03:32.299> Decay<00:03:32.360> primer<00:03:32.629> potion<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.700> it

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
Urban Decay primer potion this one if it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.970 
Urban Decay primer potion this one if it
definitely<00:03:35.180> fades<00:03:35.360> out<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.870> more<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.440> clear

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
definitely fades out to more like clear

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
definitely fades out to more like clear
and<00:03:37.159> visible<00:03:37.310> finish<00:03:37.790> as<00:03:38.000> opposed<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.110> off

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
and visible finish as opposed to the off

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.099 
and visible finish as opposed to the off
one<00:03:39.530> also<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.310> noticed<00:03:40.670> as<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:41.090> was<00:03:41.120> kind<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.930> just

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
one also I noticed as I was kind of just

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.140 
one also I noticed as I was kind of just
spreading<00:03:42.410> out<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.920> elf<00:03:43.129> primer<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.760> didn't

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
spreading out the elf primer it didn't

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.589 
spreading out the elf primer it didn't
quite<00:03:44.379> just<00:03:45.379> really<00:03:46.250> settle<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.090> blend<00:03:47.329> in

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.780 
quite just really settle in and blend in
this<00:03:47.750> quickly<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.379> kind<00:03:48.829> of<00:03:48.920> had<00:03:49.129> to<00:03:49.310> take<00:03:49.579> some

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
this quickly I kind of had to take some

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.690 
this quickly I kind of had to take some
time<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.180> just<00:03:50.359> really<00:03:50.629> let<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.709> leg<00:03:52.220> down<00:03:52.430> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
time to just really let it leg down and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.430 
time to just really let it leg down and
sleep<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.150> but<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.599> Urban<00:03:53.810> Decay<00:03:53.870> one<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.349> was

really quick a lot more effortless I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.500 
really quick a lot more effortless I
found<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.810> also<00:03:57.590> with<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:57.950> elf<00:03:58.159> one<00:03:58.549> the

found and also with the elf one the
texture<00:04:00.109> is<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.590> bit<00:04:00.829> more<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:02.090> has<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> bit<00:04:02.450> more

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
bit thicker the urban decay wine it

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.289 
bit thicker the urban decay wine it
doesn't<00:04:10.190> have<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.549> kind<00:04:10.819> of<00:04:10.849> like<00:04:11.000> slick

just<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.050> reminder<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.440> applied<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:32.190> Urban

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
just a reminder I applied the Urban

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.580 
just a reminder I applied the Urban
Decay<00:05:32.520> primer<00:05:32.880> cushion<00:05:33.360> on<00:05:33.540> this<00:05:33.690> eye<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.290> the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
Decay primer cushion on this eye and the

elf mineral eyeshadow primer on the side

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.400 
elf mineral eyeshadow primer on the side
and<00:05:36.960> I'm<00:05:37.940> surprised<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.840> elf<00:05:40.110> one

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
and I'm surprised that the elf one

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.070 
and I'm surprised that the elf one
didn't<00:05:40.860> hold<00:05:41.070> up<00:05:41.220> pretty<00:05:41.550> well<00:05:41.930> compared<00:05:42.930> to

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
didn't hold up pretty well compared to

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.530 
didn't hold up pretty well compared to
the<00:05:43.230> Uni<00:05:43.650> pp<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.250> didn't<00:05:44.550> quite<00:05:44.730> expect<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.330> I

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
the Uni pp I didn't quite expect that I

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.810 
the Uni pp I didn't quite expect that I
have<00:05:46.170> wined<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.890> elf<00:05:47.040> one<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> few<00:05:47.640> times

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
have wined the elf one a few times

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.150 
have wined the elf one a few times
before<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.240> it's<00:05:48.420> not<00:05:48.510> like<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:49.440> eyeshadows

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
before and it's not like the eyeshadows

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.850 
before and it's not like the eyeshadows
did<00:05:50.430> crease<00:05:50.730> quite<00:05:51.150> quickly<00:05:51.420> but<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:52.200> never

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
did crease quite quickly but I never

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.860 
did crease quite quickly but I never
actually<00:05:53.130> did<00:05:53.370> put<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.210> test<00:05:54.240> with<00:05:54.750> the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
actually did put it to the test with the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.020 
actually did put it to the test with the
Urban<00:05:55.110> Decay<00:05:55.170> primer<00:05:55.440> potion<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:56.460> now<00:05:56.640> I<00:05:56.670> see

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
Urban Decay primer potion and now I see

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.390

that<00:05:57.060> they<00:05:57.480> are<00:05:57.660> pretty<00:05:57.690> comparable<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.860> really

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
that they are pretty comparable I really

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.670 
that they are pretty comparable I really
think<00:05:59.610> it's<00:05:59.730> worth<00:05:59.880> it<00:06:00.120> it's<00:06:00.390> a<00:06:00.660> good<00:06:01.140> buy<00:06:01.320> for
