different<00:01:49.820> types<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.360> opinions<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.679> gel

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
different types of opinions and the gel

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.279 
different types of opinions and the gel

will actually impact the lipid for

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.779 
will actually impact the lipid for
longer<00:01:54.590> because<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.160> ultimate<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.640> not

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
longer because the ultimate is not

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
incorporated into your live way so these

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.960 
incorporated into your live way so these

for<00:02:08.000> us<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.390> try<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.630> make<00:02:08.840> some<00:02:09.020> reverse<00:02:09.289> root

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
for us to try and make some reverse root

for us to try and make some reverse root
beer<00:02:09.709> floats<00:02:10.009> here<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.580> take<00:02:10.729> root<00:02:10.940> beer<00:02:11.180> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
beer floats here we take root beer and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.180 
beer floats here we take root beer and
encapsulate<00:02:11.900> them<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.440> spears<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.040> then

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
encapsulate them into spears and then

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
encapsulate them into spears and then
serve<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.550> onto<00:02:13.730> vanilla<00:02:14.150> ice<00:02:14.300> cream

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
serve them onto vanilla ice cream

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.110 
serve them onto vanilla ice cream
so<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> first<00:02:15.739> step<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.400> measure<00:02:16.550> out<00:02:16.880> our

so the first step is to measure out our
gear<00:02:17.480> you'll<00:02:17.930> need<00:02:17.959> roughly<00:02:18.590> 1%<00:02:19.010> position<00:02:19.760> of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
gear you'll need roughly 1% position of

you're reading so here I'll be taking
150<00:02:27.900> milliliters<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.800> my<00:02:29.130> beer<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.940> what

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
150 milliliters of my beer and what

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.990 
150 milliliters of my beer and what
would<00:02:30.360> five<00:02:30.570> grams<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> sodium<00:02:31.620> alginate

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
would five grams of the sodium alginate

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.220 
would five grams of the sodium alginate
the<00:02:33.000> right<00:02:33.150> time<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.630> alternative<00:02:34.140> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the right time that the alternative is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.870 
the right time that the alternative is
quite<00:02:34.500> difficult<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:35.010> incorporate<00:02:35.160> into<00:02:35.640> your

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
quite difficult to incorporate into your

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.060 
quite difficult to incorporate into your
solution<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.930> found<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> best<00:02:37.380> method<00:02:37.950> is

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
solution so I found the best method is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.430 
solution so I found the best method is
to<00:02:38.250> use<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.490> 1/2<00:02:38.910> letter<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:40.290> you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
to use a 1/2 letter like this if you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.720 
to use a 1/2 letter like this if you
find<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.740> it's<00:02:40.920> still<00:02:41.130> quite<00:02:41.310> difficult<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
find that it's still quite difficult to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.460 
find that it's still quite difficult to
incorporate<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.570> bring<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.140> solution

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
incorporate you can bring the solution

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
incorporate you can bring the solution
to<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> boil<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.490> should<00:02:44.670> help<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
to a boil and that should help the

solution<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.220> roughly<00:03:29.400> 5<00:03:29.910> grams<00:03:30.240> of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
solution so that's roughly 5 grams of

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.360 
solution so that's roughly 5 grams of
pounding<00:03:31.080> chloride<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.740> every<00:03:32.010> meter<00:03:32.280> of

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
pounding chloride to every meter of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.400 
pounding chloride to every meter of
water

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410

like<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.250> when<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.550> promise<00:03:38.940> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
like this so that when you promise to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.800 
like this so that when you promise to
uses<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.750> gel<00:03:40.050> smoke<00:03:40.380> stick<00:03:40.680> together

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
uses the gel smoke stick together

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
uses the gel smoke stick together
this<00:03:42.810> also<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.320> another<00:03:43.680> bowl<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.160> water

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
this also have another bowl of water

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.250 
this also have another bowl of water
next<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.390> can<00:03:45.600> rinse<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.990> spheres

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
next to you so you can rinse the spheres

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.820 
next to you so you can rinse the spheres
once<00:03:46.500> they're<00:03:46.650> ready<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:49.320> now<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.680> our
