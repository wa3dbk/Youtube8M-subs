00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.530
 since your piece you know 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.009
 I wonder how many keys of hearts you will have 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.829
 two worlds compared a blackberry 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.480

 since I lost you, you know 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.050
 I wonder how many keys of hearts you will have 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 everyone seems to be with a dead star 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.690
 for me it is an immense consternation e 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.910
 when you thought of those little things 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 bisceglie there in my races if the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.660
 night he spoke for hours hours until 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.300
 sunrise in my mind you're there 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.930
 only you always the same scene seems almost 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.030
 a deja vu I remember our infinite 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.909
 even more our magic walks 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.899
 evenings your beauty makes i come 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.030
 chills 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.070
 but we know the princesses who set them up 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.740
 princes say that the behind you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.030
 only to the palace or the dark one to dedicate you 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.320
 more than a price 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.229
 you were the first one who damaged me 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.690
 severely become the tumor that you 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.970
 I take care of your mind enough now 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.390
 I want it back like fragments that 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 they come back to confuse them 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.030
 when i lost you know 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.530
 I wonder part of hearts keys you will have 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.270
 objects compare to a pin 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.130
 for I immersed myself in consternation 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.740
 since I lost you, you know 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.500
 I ask how many keys of hearts you will have e 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 many compared a star 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.470
 for me it would have emerged the more I would like all 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.140
 ways to talk to you but polci, gravedigger a 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.750
 I know two teams elsewhere 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.120
 I made a lot of mistakes but if you think about it 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 we are all that in the mistakes I have you now 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.140
 I regret it I swear it 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.450
 I would like to go back to the past but quickly 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 unique sense since you left 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 i feel nothing if body disappeared 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.770
 how a falling star of themes remains 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.290
 just a big fire inside i try 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.950
 but you know I can't turn it off I'd be 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.230
 always the most beautiful part of me 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.790
 if you are then identical part of the area 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.670
 you were the first one who damaged 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.160
 severely become the tumor that m 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.379
 corrodes the mind now enough to the acts 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.290
 I want back home and fragments that 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.830

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.200

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.900
