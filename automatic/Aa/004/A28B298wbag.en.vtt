00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.300
 place in us we are in seconds 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.870
 this is the team that we are playing 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.700

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.439
 I also can not believe it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.209
 mark martín weale rubén white more than 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.769
