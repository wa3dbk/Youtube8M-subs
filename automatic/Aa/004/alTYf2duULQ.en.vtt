we've been experiencing on our server we
then<00:00:17.609> we've<00:00:18.000> literally<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.570> been<00:00:18.660> ripping

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
then we've literally have been ripping

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
then we've literally have been ripping
our<00:00:19.199> server<00:00:19.670> apart<00:00:20.670> looking<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.449> over<00:00:21.500> taking

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.540 
our server apart looking all over taking
out<00:00:22.619> lots<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.949> things<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.279> we've<00:00:23.400> been

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
out lots of things that we've been

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
out lots of things that we've been
thinking<00:00:23.850> might<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.119> causing<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> leg<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> we

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
thinking might be causing the leg and we

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.650 
thinking might be causing the leg and we
finally<00:00:25.260> track<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> down<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.760> thing<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
finally track it down to this thing this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
finally track it down to this thing this

the<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:37.050> retriever<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the the retriever right here what it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000 
the the retriever right here what it
does<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:40.079> pumping<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
does is it it's pumping all of this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
into the retriever and what we found out

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
into the retriever and what we found out
is<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.540> glitches<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> retriever

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
is this actually glitches the retriever

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.070 
is this actually glitches the retriever
out<00:01:08.030> there<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.330> bugged<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
out there a little bit bugged and it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
out there a little bit bugged and it
causes<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.590> charcoal<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> duplicate<00:01:11.549> inside

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
causes the charcoal to duplicate inside

causes the charcoal to duplicate inside
