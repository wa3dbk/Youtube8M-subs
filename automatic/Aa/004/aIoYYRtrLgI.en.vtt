00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.069
 on bases today I brought the face 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.380
 underneath the mac is a super-ordered base 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 It does not take less than a week 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.179
 pass without some reader asking me if 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.539
 I've used it I like and whatever else 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 what ever oily skin and everything else then 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.500
 I decided to bring it in the review to tell 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 for you and also show the results 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 that she has on her skin is already 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 you are a top base used by 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.810
 professionals in the area have a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 pretty cool is used on both the catwalk 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.460
 fashion shows with also in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 professionals who use brides then it is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.860
 very good and hard enough because 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.600
 she has a huge pipe is very big 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
 I do not know if you can do it in the video. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 we fight the ipec o my 9 that neither is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.610
 For you to see size then it comes in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 nanny and let's check everything about the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 come, my husband comes with me 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.270
 We're trying to record but no one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.890
 There are people who know not to let 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 eat the blues have people who want 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.080
 play a little the pact there are people who 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 either get there dress is hard going 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.409
 to the tests 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.939
 I 'm going to test today how you've seen the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.640
 underneath the mac 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.189
 the road is used a lot almost alone 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.340
 at the end of use very much this basis 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.650
 because it is easy to apply and tough 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 enough time to apply and gave a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.570
 A little bit of basic fall and apply here 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.100
 on the back of the basic hand of every base is only 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 have a little care with her that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 Lina was a lot more mill than the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.439
 other bases my current that uses 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.180
 a long time is the c2're sometimes give 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.909
 a darkened in tone sometimes some 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.399
 the tone but in general it is c2 tÃ¡ 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 to apply the base I will use my brush 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.869
 sigma basic z ft try good to have 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 a top 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.240
 the top top was great the cut at the top 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.759
 to be able to apply it will be easier and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 gives a polish all basis mec is legal 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.930
 give the polish so that it is more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.610
 beautiful on the skin is the base to mac she 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.170
 needs to be the state needs to be 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.189
 it was not with a half face 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.590
 pale 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.929
 Let's take the product that was in the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.220
 hand with the brush and we will apply 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.920
 no mystery like all the bases 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 the test is even being the tool 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 application of it in order to be 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.700
 just with all the base and I'm going to apply 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.990
 always like I said it made it beautiful or 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.520
 I'm turning my brush and 80 in the face 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.770
 the base we 've already done while 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.940
 I will explain to you the face 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.550
 under the mac 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.430
 it is a net base then the coverage 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 She is not mean, and she is tall. She has a 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.840
 lower coverage 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.720
 but what you get on that basis is 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.660
 coverage is low if your skin is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.540
 it's in perfect quotes you do not have as many 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.450
 ways neither here nor in spots nor 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.610
 nothing is a basis that will give a good 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.950
 cover for you and it will be all right 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.390
 natural and if you have skin like 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.980
 my only need lightweight 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.170
 corrections the media really needs to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.760
 a lot of correction nowadays is yet another 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.570
 Only a speck of what I need 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.910
 to cover 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.130
 she is a very good base too 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.050
 because she will be able to make a 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.970
 coverage if you apply a two- 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.090
 layers this noise was the blush jumping 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.430
 Did you hear she's going to do one or two? 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.250
 two layers will already suffice be 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.730
 one or two calls will get your 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.350
 marchinhas that the skin will be natural 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.330
 which is the most important 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
 the blush always wanting to appear on the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.459
 video back there doing art 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.200
 the cushions never again to a place 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.530
 I do not know if you ever realized then 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.250
 messy because I put him strip 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.060
 people right 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.890
 I left there kidding, it does not come out by putting it on 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.610
 5,724 liters of base to exaggerated 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.890
 analyzed 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.150
 My goodness, when you put a lot of 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.549
 base on your hand because otherwise you will 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.590
 spend a lot of product on bard mec is expensive 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.230
 my daughter do not waste yours then 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.360
 put a little bit later put 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.080
 a little bit more as you go 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.760
 Missing you, I usually put 22 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.989
 number of lines 10 from here already 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.120
 my whole face 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.209
 a valuable tip when applying the base 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.910
 of the goal people applied the base let dry 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.160
 well talking in the band had entered the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.320
 front of the fan tacos and cold cable 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.989
 does anything takes around a 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.579
 minute 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.520
 I did not have half to base 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.099
 is the face in barueri in particular is a 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.500
 liquid base and a good look at it 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.509
 It has to be dried and it takes a little 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.880
 dry do not have patience keep looking 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.460
 in the mirror sees when the brightness of the base 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.470
 It will diminish that it will dry. 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.750
 because if you apply the powder on top of the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.970
 Wet foundation will be a beauty and 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.030
 want will only get lambuzei only 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.440
 in your face because the dust will stick in the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.120
 where the base is wet and will 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.940
 stay those paula clusters 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.250
 ax in the face to apply let dry 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.990
 and then part of the compact is fine 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.509
 You saw my face at the beginning of the video. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.099
 there were some spots 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.650
 I was a little better will give the 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.810
 already lots of acne at the beginning of the year 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.940
 past and throughout my treatment 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.759
 It's much better, skin has its spots. 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.099
 then only the application of the face in bari can 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.889
 look be critical you see that it has improved 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.139
 enough people were not even corrective 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.849
 neither dust nor blush has given an improvement 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.039
 very large 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.930
 my mac bases and windows always 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.330
 with a yellowish tone to people because 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.680
 although I'll be pretty white already 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.940
 I said if some videos but suddenly 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.949
 someone is seeing for the first time 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.690
 this video is legal this information 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.340
 if you have a pretty white face in 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.680
 relation to your body because it 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.440
 sunscreen like I should never be 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.509
 Guiding by the tone of your face only you have 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.120
 that would guide his face toward the 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.190
 your shoulder your face where you stay the same 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.310
 to the sound of shoulder and like neck is 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.680
 not only the base test done on the face 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.659
 I followed these three bridges to be able to 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.430
 stay with the skin with your face 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.050
 gaspar effect that white face the 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.840
 body and other body would be perfect 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.759
 then use this face tip in the tone of the 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.889
 shoulder that goes supercerto our house 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.240
 is good and that's what makes it hopefully 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.030
