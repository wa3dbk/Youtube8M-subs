00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.830
 we can talk about it warning us of his interest because it is obvious that he 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.799
 did not ask for our opinion 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.139
 yet we can say we can say what we want anyway 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.609
 what he does to everyone why 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.339
 we are here for you 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.480
 to serve as a backdrop for me 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.679
 beautiful sea 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.189
 that would be the most reasonable at the European level 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 good first is that we realized that 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.350
 in theory if messi if I mean if France had 100 million 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.410
 people 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.740
 all this productive patriot good but who well educated I would say that 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.120
 for kids 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.600
 for the pensec France has 60 million inhabitants 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 The least we can say is that they are not all well-kneaded 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.470
 educate productive 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 that the more our country has a lot of fragility factors 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 and curious if we came back to the franc have as common point is the following the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 finer 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.170
 a bit to the way the Chinese define the customs of the same 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 way 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.280
 she did not recommend China 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 we would be 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.900
 katie right now 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 by the powers that have the means 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.140
 yet the balance of power we can not afford 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.350
 to build a French monetary digital sovereignty 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 all this alone in our corner to leave you in the 60s 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260
 do not speak sic 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.060
 But the balance of power at the time was still much less 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.440
 unfavorable 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.330
 it's telling you that really sure to try to do that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.410
 in the current context but in the reality of power relations 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.350
 today this is rolled 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.539
 probably a possibility -30- 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.770
 according to him alone we can also talk about what to do the party 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 we must abolish the principle that was enacted in 1973 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.670
 saying that we have to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.710
 borrow money selling who the factory explained 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.070
 what was enslaved minutes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070
 we have to come back to roux principle that a lot 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 Argentine 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 can be made it is born by the state 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.200
 it's trying to use a number of safeguards because the state 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.689
 can also become dangerous to do anything 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.899
 we must have been able to put some mayors of football 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.819
 it can be assisted by eight planes 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.090
 it can be a system of parity the files had to oppose tax because 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.239
 in front you have to 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.849
 but we must return fundamentally the monetary sovereignty of the state 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.379
 that's what you need 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.589
 we do not have the means 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.829
 can not afford a recession if we did that that means basically 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.199
 we say 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.519
 acer is pretty charming the charming it's better to goldmann sachs of jp 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.779
 morgan am 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.209
 the site which makes their difficulties around the neck 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.489
 to serve his cause 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.589
 and we all want to say it for the sessions in ten years 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.549
 the reality of key power struggles 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.129
 I am fascinated by a minute 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.390
 we need only a few in the suburbs 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.159
 mulhouse organizes 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.629
 for a month of strike with unions who are paid the Chilean 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.989
 a very general progression somewhere I want to make a coup 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.269
 or the Supreme Court are right to be 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.179
 and then we follow you I'm here it's finished 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.229
 if we do it alone, that's what we have 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.449
 we do not know what to do 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.689
 it must be understood that to have the point the balance of power 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.159
 to tell all these good people that you know everyone always finds 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.039
 wonderful things 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.699
 must be done in force 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.259
 for the balance of power 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.479
 the balance of power how we do for you 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.240
 in fact at European level 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.329
 and even that's not enough 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.339
 basically you have to do it 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.459
 in a framework negotiated with 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.939
 the others are replacing recent segment the German Italians 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.939
 especially the Germans of the high economic and monetary level 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.279
 they are still 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.409
 and 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.799
 with the Russians the Chinese because by cons we expect our misfortune we have 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.479
 a great chance is that people 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.329
 if they want to say when the same bag cjp van gaal is a copy to 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.309
 government 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.309
 but we have a lot a lot now on earth 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.969
 but like many people who are tired of these assholes 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.159
 social accounts must what 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.199
 but you have to play on it 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.650
 and then hey it takes 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.650
 right here 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.479
 I do not care less that's what I would say what you need 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.689
 try 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.759
 to define the system that even time organizes teenagers often from 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.759
 sovereignty between the powers that get along 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 % you have to understand that water can not be 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.990
 but it required the establishment of regulatory instruments to 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.270
 the global scale 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.469
 it is necessary that the hottest of the category 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:52.329
 indeed actually stopped his friends who created the crisis so that he can 

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:54.699
 say today but when he says it's true 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.699
 we need instruments of regulation on a global scale severity 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.719
 this one he is dishonest continue said 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.490
 he said in a dishonest perspective 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.009
 but it's the truth 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.750
 sedighi report us dishonestly but that's the truth 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.910
 so now when I remember but what happens if 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.280
 remember we remain 10 the most reasonable would be distributed people 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.170
 who think and that they are more competent than me too I listen to them 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.310
 because those who are more knowledgeable than me understand what they 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.779
 know very well how do I recognize that this kind of person 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.979
 it would be a European currency snake 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.089
 but with a euro that restrict the municipalities 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.679
 and which will serve as a stallion of relations regulated with Russia the 

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:33.770
 China and other monetary issues 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.789
 it is during group pro b replaced by a single currency 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.020
 World 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.500
 but a world monetary system negotiated at regular intervals 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.940
 if we subtract the system from parities predict markets 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.479
 it would be more reasonable 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.510
 the audit which obviously is that 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.559
 if you do that for a while you recognize 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:57.930
 that regulatory instruments must be put in place 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.939
 worldwide 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:01.539
 and if the truth 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.449
 it must be put in place 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.849
 the question is who want to come 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.259
 is it a coalition of sovereign states 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.319
 or what is the financial markets 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.669
 I think it takes 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.580
 it takes idea 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.720
 the forces that in the coming years 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.930
 you can set up this coalition of sovereign states 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.199
 it's going to be negotiated between the Americans, the Chinese and the Indians 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.869
 in the end we will be told who is taking care of us
