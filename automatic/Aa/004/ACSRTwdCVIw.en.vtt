00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.000
 all living things are made up 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.369
 of one or more cells makes it the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 cell it's the elementary unit of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.790
 structures of living things 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 so despite a great diversity of 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.410
 cell types the cells are going 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.340
 own we 'll see it from 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.200
 Common structural features 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 for example they will all be 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.850
 limited by a plasma membrane to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 union and well we'll have a volume 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.949
 that we will call the cytoplasm and at 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.330
 sothys within this cytoplasm for 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.280
 this unit structure was fine 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.110
 find genetic information 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 all cells have a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.159
 information genetically there are the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 three elements common to all 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.670
 cells called the unit of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.769
 structure then among the cells of the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 living reign we'll distinguish two 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.949
 large cell types following the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 presence or absence of organs it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 so we call organelles a structure 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
 have an element that we will find in the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 cytoplasm and that is itself limited 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.049
 by a membrane so in fact we will see 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.479
 a cytoplasm that we will say 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 compartmentalized so if for example in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.240
 this cell we find no organelles 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.950
 Well we will see a cell type 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.130
 we will call prokaryotes 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.219
 their trial to say before to the cart 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 refers to the kernel if on the contrary 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.369
 there is the presence of organizations towards 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 which one we are going to talk about 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.009
 eukaryotic cell them for real because iott 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.079
 core then interesting us all 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.369
 first type of cells that is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.120
 the prokaryotic cell 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.520
 so we find 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.050
 the unit of structure the general cell 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.570
 that is the membrane the cytoplasm 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.680
 and genetic information then at 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.460
 prokaryotic cells 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.320
 we will find in addition a parish we go 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.020
 call a parish of the bacterial type 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.630
 so who will form a framework more or 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.030
 less rigid around this cell 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.390
 is against within the cytoplasm one 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.740
 will of course not find any 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.080
 organelles, we can find 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.580
 but it is not obligatory 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.620
 other elements such as 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.310
 flagella for moving the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.480
 mobility of these cells then among these 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.850
 prokaryotic cells 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.320
 we can mention the bacteria the arcs and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.120
 where bows and bacteria 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.920
 and then these are cells that are in 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.680
 general of very small size that make 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.320
 about 1 1 micrometer or so 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.710
 a few micrometers in length 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.920
 here are some examples of cells 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:43.690
 prokaryotic 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:47.350
 here any bacterial the second big 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.270
 type and eukaryotic cell the cell 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.780
 eukaryotic like for example a cells 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.970
 animal and so we find the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.090
 three basic elements of the unity of 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.620
 structures the plasma membrane within 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.670
 of which one finds a cytoplasm and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.040
 genetic information 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.860
 well we will find organelles 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.100
 like for example a kernel that's going 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.760
 allow that will allow to poke 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.830
 and the genetic information and then for 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.720
 to quote only him 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.300
 another organ it like for example the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.060
 mitochondria whose function we will see 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.030
 a little bit later that is at 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.280
 within the cytoplasm so here we have the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.459
 general structure of the cell 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.750
 eukaryote with two examples of organs 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.370
 these eukaryotic cells are 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.900
 cells that are larger 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.060
 that prokaryotic cells 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.360
 she can do a few dozen 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 micrometers in length and while the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.709
 prokaryotic cells are all 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.900
 all belong to organizations 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.760
 unicellular and well cells 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.340
 eukaryotes can be part 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.799
 unicellular organisms but 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.980
 also of multicellular organisms 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 and all multicellular organisms 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.409
 they are composed of eukaryotic cells 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.989
 here are some examples of cells 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.950
 eukaryotes for example cells of 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.780
 yeast starting friends if cells of 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.739
 oral cell liver and its 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.479
 neurons blood cells 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.019
 then a little peculiarity among the 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.260
 eukaryotic cells and well it's going to be 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.460
 the eukaryotic cell says plants 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.220
 unlike the eukaryotic cell one 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.320
 will say animal type and well the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.180
 eukaryotic plant cells will possess 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.130
 additional organelles by 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.169
 compared to what we have just described 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.520
 finally additional structures 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:44.100
 also then at the level of these 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.190
 additional organelles mention by 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.530
 example the chloroplast which is a 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.410
 organism that is green in color and 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.550
 which is therefore composed of chlorophyll 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.889
 all eukaryotic plant cells 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.880
 does not have a substitute stand by 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.160
 against all eukaryotic cells 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.160
 plant has a vacuoles which is a 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.830
 a space within the cytoplasm that is 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.240
 compound limited by a membrane and which 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.090
 is very rich in water have certainly a 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.830
 solute and all eukaryotic cells 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.910
 plant will be limited by a parish 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.030
 but a parish that is not the same 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.190
 type that bacterial walls then 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.740
 this parish will form a rigid frame 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.710
 around the cell these cells 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.330
 Vegetable eukaryotes are cells 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.610
 who are soon taller and 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.650
 which are in general much larger than 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.070
 eukaryotic animal cells that one 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.130
 previously saw then a cell 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.330
 eukaryotic plant is not 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.580
 necessarily chlorophyllian it is 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.320
 say do not necessarily have any 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.990
 chloroplasts all parts of a 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.669
 plant are not green and in this case 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.380
 we'll just have a cell 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.669
 plant eukaryote then 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.130
 here is a small family portrait of 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.389
 some plant cells 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.599
 chlorophyllian here we recognize very 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.909
 well the chloroplasts the parish its 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.219
 thick the moral and plasmic that is 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.229
 glued against the wall is here so 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.570
 hard to distinguish the core the 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:16.590
 mitochondria and that's most certainly 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.870
 the cytoplasm or lava clocks others 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.430
 plant cells 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.370
 then no chlorophyllian here we do not 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.919
 recognizes that the core vacuoles very 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.039
 very big that qpi so pretty much all the 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:33.180
 volume of the chlorophyllian cell 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.280
 here and plant cells here that 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.180
 for example in the 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.750
 transport of the scene so if we do 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.580
 the balance sheet is well we have a diagram of 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.620
 common base all the cells that is 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.690
 composed of a plasma membrane with 1 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.190
 6 thp asthma and information 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.500
 genetics found in all three 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.219
 cell types and then finally one 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.990
 has small variants with the presence 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.639
 or no organelles within so soon 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.380
 plea that will help distinguish 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.260
 two major types of cells the 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.130
 eukaryotic cells of type between 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.080
 Quotation animal is of vegetal type 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.150
 chlorophyllian for example here and 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.979
 second big guy the cells 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.370
 prokaryotes like for example the 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:16.370
 bacteria 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.850
 then this unity of structures between 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.950
 all the cells of living beings is going 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.500
 reveal an index of kinship 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.940
 and we assume that all the cells 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.470
 that we just wrote all types 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.420
 cellular phones just described and 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.910
 well are from a cell type 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.300
 ancestral tonga sure we have no longer 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.220
 no trace today and from 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.680
 this ancestral cell type and well 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.140
 riffs all types that we 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.030
 knows ie the cells 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.300
 prokaryotes that groups together bacteria 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:53.090
 and bows and bacteria and cells 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.340
 eukaryotes in which we find the 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.669
 plant group the group of 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:01.000
 mushrooms and the group of cells 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.000
 animal
