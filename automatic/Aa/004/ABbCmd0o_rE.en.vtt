00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hey guys 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.820
 our first biology class and the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.280
 matter is the biomolecules that are all 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.560
 type of organic molecules that have a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 or more functions within an organism 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 alive beauty these thousand molecules are 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 composed of a select group of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.930
 elements that shorten this element 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.140
 chemicals are oxygen 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 nitrogen 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 hydrogen draft beer and phosphorus can 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 believe together these elements 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 chemicals make up 98 percent of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.579
 mass of any living organism beauty 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 The first molecule I want 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.890
 to present to you is water because 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.250
 it constitutes 70 per cent of the organism 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 70% of our body is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 pure water and it is considered a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 universal solvent because it develops 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.789
 chemical substances within a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.690
 this makes it easier to travel from 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.000
 substances 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 inside of our organism, well 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 in addition the water maintains the temperature 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 of our body and participates in reactions 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.020
 with a dehydration reaction that is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
 example in the synthesis of a protein and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.759
 hydrolysis reactions that are on the break 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.280
 from sugars into smaller sugars for 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.650
 energy production then personal water 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.770
 it has a great importance within 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.080
 any organism is fine since it does not 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 We told them I want to talk to you guys. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 a little more of the sugars that are also 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.670
 called simple carbohydrate Indians 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 personal matters are extreme 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 importance within living organisms 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.759
 because from them we withdraw 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.799
 the energy required for the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.549
 functioning of the metabolism of our 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.070
 body 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.280
 addition some sugars have enough 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.619
 good right structural importance these 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.610
 sugars can be classified as young 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.530
 karidis disaccharide and polysaccharide 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.780
 guys monosaccharides are those 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 simpler juices neighbors which is a 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.450
 example the painters who are present 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 no dna and no rn what are we going to sign 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.550
 a little further on in our class 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 already the disaccharides comes from the union of 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.670
 two smaller molecules which are the monkeys 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 to caresses 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.680
 an example is the lactose present 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.830
 in milk and comes from the union of a molecule 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.560
 of glucose plus one molecule of 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.710
 galactose and polysaccharides only 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.620
 those sugars big coming memories 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.320
 of union in various ways to fall from 7 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.460
 And then people want to bid three for you. 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.960
 very important that starch is the 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.800
 cellulose and glycogen, the starch and 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.620
 glycogen are reserve sugars 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.050
 vegetable and animal, the friend stays there 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.760
 in the roots of vegetables waiting for 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.190
 moment of lack of energy by these 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 vegetables is where it is broken in 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.990
 molecules and serves the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.960
 metabolism of these vegetables glycogen 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.850
 Most of him stays there in the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.860
 our liver waiting for a moment of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.080
 lack of energy in our body to 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.180
 be broken into being used for the 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.630
 right atp production 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.670
 already pulp it has great importance 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.100
 in the plants it composes the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.989
 cell wall of these vegetables 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.480
 then it very well defines the structure 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.390
 prevents the invasion of 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.580
 microorganisms and the dehydration of 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.280
 vegetables, that's fine then the sugars are 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.600
 very important 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.400
 another very important class of 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.670
 molecules that I want to quote to you 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.370
 are lipids special mendes 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.070
 fats and personal waxes 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.440
 lipids are insoluble and water therefore 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.989
 that the intake of fats is not very 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.840
 because they can 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.150
 accumulate within the blood farms 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.630
 and prevent the circulation of blood 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.520
 can cause even a heart attack but also 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.250
 has a positive side of these lipids 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.650
 soluble in water is the case of 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.300
 threshing floors that are present in vegetables 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.209
 these fairs and prevent these 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.220
 vegetables forgive water for the environment and 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.680
 this water is very important within the 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.140
 plants in the process of photosynthesis by 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.549
 beauty example 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.130
 Now I can tell you about a 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.680
 very special house of molecules that are 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.050
 protect them 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.509
 mine because they are special because 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.000
 they have several functions within the 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.460
 organisms have functions for example 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.250
 storage of 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.979
 transport of Catalan substances from 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.949
 certain chemical reactions these proteins 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.930
 they are made up of sub 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.690
 subunit units that we call 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.870
 of amino acids these amino acids are 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.680
 through the peptide bonds and 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.770
 form large polypeptide chains that 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.180
 result in a protein there are 20 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.500
 types of amino acids 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.050
 this amino acid so they can 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.060
 connect in different quantities and in 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.699
 different positions 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.330
 this is what will determine protein that 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.009
 It will appear in your body that's fine. 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.940
 I want to tell you a class 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.650
 proteins that are enzymes 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.870
 the enzymes are responsible for 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.889
 to catalyze reactions within 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.560
 organisms 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.780
 then they accelerate increase the 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.860
 velocities with which these reactions 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.710
 happens 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.070
 actions will happen without the presence of 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.320
 enzyme within organisms if only the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.630
 a speed that is detrimental to our 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.909
 metabolism is why they exist 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.370
 sure but you have to keep in mind that 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.639
 they are always specific to a 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.669
 substrate then an enzyme it will act 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.039
 always with a specific substrate that is 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.050
 an example is the case of fats 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.169
 the enzymes that digest the fats that 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.970
 our girls are my tits are 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.460
 only they who will do this work 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.770
 We must also take into account 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.430
 enzymes have a range of ph 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.740
 and temperature acting then if the enzyme 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.830
 works in a range of ph in one 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.199
 temperature and you change this pH or 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.150
 At this temperature the enzyme 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.580
 work can suffer up to a 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.560
 denaturation sure to lose 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.770
 totally its function 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.650
 beauty, last I would like to talk 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.970
 for you of the nuclear stars to use 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.360
 nuclei are dna and rn to dna 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.520
 it guarantees heredity 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.620
 It is the right organism that keeps the 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.490
 our generation characteristics for 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.819
 generation 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.689
 rn is involved in protein synthesis 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:45.479
 some of the production of proteins staff 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:48.389
 the dn a riaa are composed of sub 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.789
 units called nucleotides 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.900
 these cores are composed of a pen 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:57.120
 tozzi not dna this pintosa 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.889
 deoxyribose in rn to this pintosa 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.990
 certain ribose 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.719
 the nucleotides are also composed of 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.750
 a phosphoric acid in a base 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:10.590
 nitrogenous bases 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:13.860
 an adenine may be a thymine 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.219
 a cytokine and a more harmful 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.849
 always remember that in rn the agent does not 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.460
 try mine only have horror to cila and no dna 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.319
 We do not have Sila, we only have 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.449
 team right 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.919
 this is the composition of our acids 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.779
 Nuclear 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.639
 That's what I had for you guys. 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:35.150
 our first biology class 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.150
 thank you guys
