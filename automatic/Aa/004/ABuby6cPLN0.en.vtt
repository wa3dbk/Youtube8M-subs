00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
we have to be proud of I think we've

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
we have to be proud of I think we've
been<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> biggest<00:00:45.719> teams<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
been one of the biggest teams in the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.560 
been one of the biggest teams in the
last<00:00:46.140> decade<00:00:46.730> what<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.329> drawer

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
last decade what you make of the drawer

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.850 
last decade what you make of the drawer
itself<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.460> think<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> draw<00:00:51.590> as<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> group

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
itself I think the draw as the group

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
itself I think the draw as the group
stays<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.309> every<00:00:53.550> year<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.270> tough<00:00:54.780> teams<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
stays like every year the tough teams of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.439 
stays like every year the tough teams of
course<00:00:55.680> obviously<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.329> we

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
course obviously we know some of them we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.840 
course obviously we know some of them we
played<00:00:57.690> against<00:00:58.230> rubber<00:00:58.440> than<00:00:58.590> any<00:00:58.770> camp<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
played against rubber than any camp a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
played against rubber than any camp a
game<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> group<00:01:01.140> stages<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
game I think the group stages you have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
game I think the group stages you have
to<00:01:02.489> play<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.510> play<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.439> those

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

the<00:01:12.030> teams<00:01:12.210> who<00:01:12.390> played<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.960> we've<00:01:13.140> got

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the teams who played I think we've got

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
the teams who played I think we've got
some<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.710> journeys<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.340> aren't<00:01:14.580> roost

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
some good journeys there aren't roost

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.310 
some good journeys there aren't roost
some<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.810> longer<00:01:16.200> wait<00:01:16.350> ships

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
some really really longer wait ships

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
some really really longer wait ships
happy<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.990> see<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> season<00:01:22.380> goes

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
happy with that see how the season goes

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.249 
happy with that see how the season goes
obviously<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.670> objective<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> get

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
obviously the objective is to get

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
obviously the objective is to get
through<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> group<00:01:25.650> stage<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.009> finish<00:01:26.460> top

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
through the group stage and finish top

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
through the group stage and finish top
of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> group<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.270> we'll<00:01:28.170> work<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of the group and I think we'll work on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
of the group and I think we'll work on
that<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.890> next<00:01:29.070> few<00:01:29.189> months<00:01:29.810> finding

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that for next few months finding

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
that for next few months finding
yourself<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.350> Monaco

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
yourself here Monaco

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
yourself here Monaco
if<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.900> second<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
if we can do it for the second time in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
if we can do it for the second time in
the<00:01:37.229> road<00:01:37.350> it'll<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.400> team<00:01:38.700> since

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the road it'll be the first team since

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
the road it'll be the first team since
92<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> well<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.619> great<00:01:40.799> players<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
92 to do it well with great players like

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.620 
92 to do it well with great players like
Leo<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.970> would<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.090> an<00:01:42.270> objective

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
Leo I think that would be an objective

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.700 
Leo I think that would be an objective
obviously<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.350> team<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
obviously to be to be the first team to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.179 
obviously to be to be the first team to
do<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> win<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> Champions<00:01:47.729> League<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.890> set

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
do it to win the Champions League to set

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.690 
do it to win the Champions League to set
records<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.640> records<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.930> always

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
records and records it's and it's always
