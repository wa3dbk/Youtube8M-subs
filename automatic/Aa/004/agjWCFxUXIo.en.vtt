00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.239
 Mack bandage 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.890
 a new development Â«The doctor knows village projects of Repsol Uschi 1 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.229
 to protect the Christians their animals in minor and major injuries 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.079
 The drug and inhibitor free can be used effectively Volz and 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.080
 Protection in case of injury 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.380
 and act preventively happy about stressed seats 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 There is no waiting time when using the associations 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.790
 In case of injury, the Mac bandage will either not jump on the fresh one 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.710
 more bleeding wound or an already stuffy injury 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.710
 built up 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.420
 the shock among the union members Weichen 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 so that no hard substance disturbs the milking or painful again 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840
 can break up 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.290
 with unharmed horror as preventive protection or in the finished 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.590
 Concept and please pay attention 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.550
 that the bandage is put on like this 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.830
 that offers the tip tilted 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.180
 without wetting the dressing 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 The dressing is applied before milking 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.890
 The teat and an injury must be carefully removed from adhering dirt 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.100
 be cleaned and dried so that the dressing can adhere well 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 open the packaging in which the two seem rather shy hands 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.189
 and even goal is to remove the dressing from the pack so 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.810
 that the papers side to them points left and right of the perforation 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.579
 Touch and pull apart until the paper flags 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.399
 Now remove the small paper technology 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.399
 Do not touch the adhesive surface of the dressing 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.980
 Place the clear edge on the teat along the teats ACS at the bow must 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.370
 pointing down 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.200
 the association is allowed 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.700
 can not be extended by Bremen they could otherwise exist now 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.860
 pin down and reduce the lag of fortune is very important that that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.080
 Leaving the bandage completely with the beginning of the bandage 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 avoid wrinkles when putting on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 Now put on the tool as usual and weigh 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.609
 Take control of the bandage after milking 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.609
 safe detention 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.789
 The association on TV simply by wanting Tom Wolter ground for the tenth 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.019
 Game to go 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.739
 this dissolves without residue without injuring the skin or the walls 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.029
 have 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.309
 repeat the process if you have more associations Paula Patton 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 apply 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.430
 For example, this is always required if all groups violate 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.819
 supply 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.649
 Here, first a Mac Association is created 29 times 122 hiking group 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:58.849
 and this fixed with a large Mac bandage 38 times 176 overlap 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.849
 This ensures that the Copen bandage holds 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.659
 in the same way they provide a long to tenth 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.680
 make sure that the bandages overlap from Gunten's top 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.219
 be created 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.639
 the association is doing well 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.639
 if he comes close to the torture methods 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.260
 if the bandage could not be applied completely without wrinkles just use the 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.259
 Smooth fingers 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.859
 should the bandage have loosened a bit after milking, then they will stroke 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.409
 the association again 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.409
 or cut open the loosened corner with scissors 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.789
 if you want to increase the size of a too thin teat when gluing 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.789
 They have several associations directly on top of each other 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.389
 It is absolutely necessary here 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.389
 This looks at the bandages before milking 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.719
 all associations must overlap completely 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.089
 pay particular attention to the fact that the bandages do not moisten when typing 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.169
 become 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.169
 which considers me for further processing 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.879
 the bandage has to reach the Kreuther ground until you reach it 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.799
 if the teats tip protected between the Mac times and peninsulars 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.989
 should be fixed 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.989
 then a dressing can be created with the milk not milked 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.930
 This is done by putting a bandage on the tip of the teat before half past eleven 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.190
 overlapping then another bandage will be attached significantly above 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 the teats tip reaches out 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.029
 the overlapping bandage is tied together 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.529
 to expose the teats tip pattern protruding bandage 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.860
 This lace protection can then come with a new bandage 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.970
 in general, despite his injury normal markets with the Magna reckon 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.419
 Multiple markets with a federation 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.719
 effective protection supports the healing process 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.150
 usually it is quieter here 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
 the association virtually replaces the chances 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 The dressing does not stick to the wet wound 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.229
 The advantages mentioned can lead to a reduced supply failure 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.680
 their risk of injury can be reduced
