show you things from the world of
extremely<00:00:13.679> small<00:00:13.830> mechanics<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.759> today<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
extremely small mechanics and today is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.000 
extremely small mechanics and today is
gonna<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.599> little<00:00:15.929> bit<00:00:16.080> different<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.830> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
gonna be a little bit different so this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.340 
gonna be a little bit different so this
is<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.789> hour<00:00:18.180> hand<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> regular

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
is the hour hand of the regular

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
is the hour hand of the regular
timepiece<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.980> were<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.789> today

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
timepiece that were used to and today

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
timepiece that were used to and today
this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> talk<00:00:22.590> about

incredible clock I'm just going to talk
about<00:00:36.600> why<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.140> exists<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.219> we're<00:00:38.460> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about why it exists so we're in

about why it exists so we're in
Switzerland<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> small<00:00:39.510> country<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Switzerland it's a small country as you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
Switzerland it's a small country as you
know<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.500> nevertheless<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.160> quite<00:00:41.370> complex

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
know but nevertheless it's quite complex

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
know but nevertheless it's quite complex
and<00:00:42.059> made<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.629> small<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.620> contour

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and made out of small different contour

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.160 
and made out of small different contour

have decided to offer a special clock

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
have decided to offer a special clock
which<00:01:21.150> represented<00:01:21.900> most<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> know-how

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
which represented most of the know-how

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
which represented most of the know-how
that<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.909> find<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.479> contour<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that you can find in this contour and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
that you can find in this contour and
some<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> values<00:01:26.130> obviously<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.880> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
some of the values obviously and they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.350 
some of the values obviously and they
asked<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> Rochelle<00:01:28.680> mill<00:01:28.890> company<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:30.030> take

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
asked the Rochelle mill company to take

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
asked the Rochelle mill company to take
part<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.869> project<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.040> three

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
part in this project as well as three

part in this project as well as three
technical<00:01:32.790> school<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.869> control<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.860> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
technical school of the control so it's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
technical school of the control so it's
a<00:01:35.100> private-public<00:01:35.850> type<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.240> project<00:01:36.689> which

it and maintaining it so if you want to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.740 
it and maintaining it so if you want to
see<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.880> guess<00:03:20.120> you'll<00:03:20.300> have<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.510> go<00:03:20.720> to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
