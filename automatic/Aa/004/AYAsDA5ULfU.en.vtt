00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.979
 hello how enchanted 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.110
 Well, right now we are starting the assembly phase 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.859
 and we will have started last week 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.720
 but by theme and tima tolo tour we had to postpone a little 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.759
 the beggining 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.609
 and right now, we have been distributing the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.550
 commodity 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.899
 tag and start I'll boot what is the assembly is the one in the region 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 the next steps is on the one hand 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.640
 we will continue with the assembly of fiberglass 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.590
 At the same time, the startup of what are the systems of 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.930
 installations both the hydraulic installation 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.000
 as the electrical installation they have to and in parallel for an issue of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.550
 completion of work and optimize the resources we have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.180
 In this case it is simple because we are inside a water park that already 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.380
 it has the cava the hydraulic installations 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.430
 between results easy to take advantage of from a technical room and assistant 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.540
 the el in performing that hydraulic installation until the new attraction 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.259
 they are usually through a compensation deposit by the sun 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.290
 attractions 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.680
 that handle a minimum volume all cutting loyalty 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.119
 in all of that after a deposit of compensation that already existed in this 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 park case 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 because the installation of new pumping is done this process to adopt 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.340
 the new attraction 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.460
 removed to the pipeline installation and water return 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 plus filtration and chemical treatment 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.320
 if traction has several unique things because 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.390
 it's a last-minute attraction 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.090
 per cent dormal mind this kind of attractions 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.480
 percent handle different types 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.120
 The section stopped and the way it was taken 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.740
 in the case of the operation that we are mounting that has the commercial name 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.100
 of turu sides 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.540
 what it does is combine three different types of water attractions 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.850
 the traction begins with a first stretch of 12 meters in length 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.479
 which is a plagiarism is a closed tube 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.219
 percent finished that first stretch of the attraction continued with a tube 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.589
 open open session with a steep slope of more than 60 degrees 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.909
 there it empties into a boomerang 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.189
 what is a large tube of wide section 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.769
 that has an ascending path then descending and through 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.609
 a camel hump arrives 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.899
 by means of a braked idea which does not require a pool 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:36.739
 of reception 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.900
 the advantage then what in a single after having dinner to himself 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.369
 we are combining what it does 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.869
 4 5 years were three different types of attractions and nowadays the 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:47.979
 manufacturers 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.339
 he 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.929
 he gets to work with all his ingenuity to try 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.979
 conjugate all those emotions in huaura in a single attraction room 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.469
 were the factors that have been taken into account are a little what I was telling you 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.599
 of the originality that the operation has 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.519
 in little space because we are with a limited availability 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.919
 the floor surface inside the water park 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.059
 in little space you get 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.299
 join in a single attraction three different sensations on the one hand 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.989
 a closed ceiling where the sense of orientation is lost 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.099
 with turns of more than 360 degrees lobÃ³n everything have opened of great slope 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.179
 and the arrival through a boomerang 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.099
 i a row braked by what you get is a little bit that's 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.129
 alternating those three sensations in a very short time and from a link from a 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.829
 only attraction
