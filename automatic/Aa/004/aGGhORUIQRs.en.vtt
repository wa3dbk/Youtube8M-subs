00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
was very very bitter and so I'll going

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.600 
was very very bitter and so I'll going
to<00:00:31.579> go<00:00:31.849> and<00:00:32.810> i'll<00:00:33.050> just<00:00:33.200> see<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:33.440> do<00:00:33.950> love<00:00:34.310> celery

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
to go and i'll just see I do love celery

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.910 
to go and i'll just see I do love celery
I<00:00:35.030> think<00:00:35.360> it's<00:00:35.480> lovely<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:36.079> takes<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.590> long<00:00:36.860> time

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
I think it's lovely it takes a long time

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.170 
I think it's lovely it takes a long time
to<00:00:37.489> grow<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:38.930> can<00:00:39.170> be<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.320> bit<00:00:39.500> fafi<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.370> but

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
to grow and it can be a bit fafi and but

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.110 
to grow and it can be a bit fafi and but
there<00:00:41.300> are<00:00:41.450> all<00:00:41.690> sorts<00:00:41.720> of<00:00:42.080> different<00:00:42.320> and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
there are all sorts of different and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.970 
there are all sorts of different and
different<00:00:44.120> types<00:00:44.480> of<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.140> some<00:00:45.830> of<00:00:45.890> you

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
different types of it and some of you

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.010 
different types of it and some of you
have<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.190> put<00:00:46.340> paper<00:00:46.640> round<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.390> keep<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.750> white

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
have to put paper round to keep it white

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.690 
have to put paper round to keep it white
and<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.710> think<00:00:49.160> this<00:00:49.250> one's<00:00:49.490> quite

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
and I think this one's quite

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700 
and I think this one's quite
straightforward<00:00:50.510> but<00:00:50.630> anyway<00:00:50.960> I'll<00:00:51.470> give<00:00:51.680> it

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
straightforward but anyway I'll give it

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.060 
straightforward but anyway I'll give it
a<00:00:51.860> go<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.610> that's<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:53.000> one<00:00:53.120> I've<00:00:53.300> got<00:00:53.510> there

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
a go but that's the one I've got there

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.500 
a go but that's the one I've got there
it's<00:00:55.070> called<00:00:55.370> sig<00:00:55.940> free<00:00:56.900> odd<00:00:58.510> sounds

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's called sig free odd sounds

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.230 
it's called sig free odd sounds
interesting<00:01:00.020> anyway<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:01.370> i'll<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:01.700> show<00:01:02.210> you

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
the same they smell of celery so they're

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.929 
the same they smell of celery so they're
very<00:01:54.139> very<00:01:54.590> tiny<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.340> look<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:55.759> they

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.849 
actually look like very very small
carrot<00:01:58.009> seeds<00:01:58.389> they<00:01:59.389> will<00:01:59.539> get<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.380> i<00:02:00.409> will

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
carrot seeds they will get so i will

can harvest it from june to october so

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.590 
can harvest it from june to october so
that's<00:02:48.190> not<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.490> long<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.850> thought<00:02:49.090> actually

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
that's not as long as I thought actually

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.710 
that's not as long as I thought actually
if<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.920> are<00:02:51.070> sewing<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.880> March<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.510> it's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
if you are sewing it in March and it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.320 
if you are sewing it in March and it's
still<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.990> bit<00:02:53.170> cold<00:02:53.440> outside<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:54.310> would<00:02:55.150> suggest

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
still a bit cold outside I would suggest

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.920 
still a bit cold outside I would suggest
that<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:56.170> some<00:02:56.550> form<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.670> cloth<00:02:58.000> or<00:02:58.360> you

know plastic see-through covering over
the<00:03:02.110> top<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.220> keep<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.490> extra

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the top of it just to keep it extra

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
in the greenhouse and I won't bother to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.820 
in the greenhouse and I won't bother to
put<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.850> cover<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.239> them<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:14.560> when<00:03:14.709> they

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
put a cover on them and but when they

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.320 
put a cover on them and but when they
start<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.220> come<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.030> need<00:03:16.090> to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
start to come up and I need to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.660 
start to come up and I need to
transplant<00:03:16.900> them<00:03:17.080> then<00:03:17.560> I'll<00:03:17.890> show<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.280> that

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.360 
transplant them then I'll show you that
and<00:03:19.000> I'm<00:03:19.780> quite<00:03:20.110> interested<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.800> see<00:03:20.950> whether

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
and I'm quite interested to see whether

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.979 
and I'm quite interested to see whether
they<00:03:21.610> look<00:03:21.820> exactly<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.390> same<00:03:22.510> when<00:03:22.870> they

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
they look exactly the same when they

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.780 
they look exactly the same when they
come<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.320> they<00:03:23.470> most<00:03:23.680> probably<00:03:23.769> will<00:03:24.340> actually

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
come up they most probably will actually

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.420 
come up they most probably will actually
but<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.380> those<00:03:26.560> many<00:03:26.890> questions

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
but it's one of those many questions

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.340 
but it's one of those many questions
that<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:28.120> which<00:03:28.660> I'm<00:03:28.870> sure<00:03:29.080> will<00:03:29.290> be

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
that I have which I'm sure will be

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.680 
that I have which I'm sure will be
answered<00:03:29.890> very<00:03:30.130> very<00:03:30.430> soon<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.239> hopefully

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
answered very very soon so hopefully

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.210 
answered very very soon so hopefully
they'll<00:03:31.870> start<00:03:32.200> popping<00:03:32.620> through<00:03:32.800> in<00:03:33.130> a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
they'll start popping through in a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.640 
they'll start popping through in a
couple<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.610> weeks<00:03:33.670> time<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.080> I'll<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.290> leave

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
those in the greenhouse to grow

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.630
