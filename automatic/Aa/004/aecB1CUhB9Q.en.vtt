00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
I like about this is that it really

kidding<00:03:24.489> no<00:03:24.910> exaggeration<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.470> only

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
kidding no exaggeration the only

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.120 
kidding no exaggeration the only
downside<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.290> fact<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.860> it

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
downside to this it is the fact that it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.160 
downside to this it is the fact that it
is<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.489> lotion<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.360> will<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.810> apply<00:03:32.110> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
is a lotion so you will have to apply it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.360 
is a lotion so you will have to apply it
onto<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:33.130> armpits<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.650> would<00:03:35.920> with

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
onto your armpits like you would with

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.820 
onto your armpits like you would with
you<00:03:37.000> know<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> lotion<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:37.840> body<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.470> that

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
you know a lotion to your body so that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.770 
you know a lotion to your body so that
is<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> only<00:03:39.280> downtime<00:03:39.880> because<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:40.600> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
is the only downtime because it is so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.370 
is the only downtime because it is so
much<00:03:40.959> easier<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:42.280> use<00:03:42.489> like<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> do<00:03:43.750> spray<00:03:44.140> or<00:03:44.350> a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
much easier to use like a do spray or a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.309 
much easier to use like a do spray or a
deal<00:03:44.739> roll-on<00:03:45.400> or<00:03:45.430> stick<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.780> everything

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
deal roll-on or stick but everything

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.780 
deal roll-on or stick but everything
like<00:03:47.500> how<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:48.100> keeps<00:03:48.459> me<00:03:49.230> try<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.620> protect<00:03:51.580> it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
like how it keeps me try and protect it

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.199
