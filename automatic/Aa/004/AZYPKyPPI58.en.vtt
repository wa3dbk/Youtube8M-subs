now I'm trying to figure out who's gonna
go<00:04:03.379> because<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:04.610> go<00:04:04.760> here

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
go because you go here

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.190 
go because you go here
as<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.610> showed<00:04:06.820> before<00:04:06.850> in<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> previous<00:04:07.840> video

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
as I showed before in the previous video

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.570 
as I showed before in the previous video
you<00:04:08.380> can<00:04:08.530> see<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.800> value<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.310> horses

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
you can see the value of the horses

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.870 
you can see the value of the horses
shila's<00:04:10.360> value<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.900> 13<00:04:11.380> ziana<00:04:12.310> looks<00:04:12.730> like

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
shila's value is 13 ziana looks like

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.020 
shila's value is 13 ziana looks like
she's<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.620> teeter-tottering<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:15.030> going

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
she's kind of teeter-tottering on going

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.570 
she's kind of teeter-tottering on going
or<00:04:16.450> leaving<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.810> farm<00:04:17.100> kabhi<00:04:18.100> right<00:04:18.400> now

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
or leaving the farm kabhi right now

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.110 
or leaving the farm kabhi right now
usually<00:04:18.850> my<00:04:19.330> my<00:04:19.750> um<00:04:19.989> my<00:04:20.290> games<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.430> horses<00:04:21.850> or

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
usually my my um my games of horses or

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.910 
usually my my um my games of horses or
monsters<00:04:22.900> or<00:04:23.050> whatever<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.500> ones<00:04:23.680> who<00:04:23.830> have

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
monsters or whatever the ones who have

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.730 
monsters or whatever the ones who have
the<00:04:23.950> highest<00:04:24.130> value<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.820> dominant<00:04:25.210> ones<00:04:25.740> but

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
the highest value the dominant ones but

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.180 
the highest value the dominant ones but
um<00:04:27.390> naturally<00:04:28.390> if<00:04:28.660> OOP<00:04:28.990> starts<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.560> because<00:04:30.100> of

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
um naturally if OOP starts to because of

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.070 
um naturally if OOP starts to because of
her<00:04:30.280> wisdom<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.730> age<00:04:30.910> she's<00:04:31.780> still<00:04:31.870> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
her wisdom and age she's still the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.450 
her wisdom and age she's still the
dominant<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.680> if<00:04:32.770> she<00:04:32.950> really<00:04:32.980> starts

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
dominant but if she really starts

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.800 
dominant but if she really starts
sucking<00:04:33.760> than<00:04:33.910> Kwame<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.300> gonna<00:04:34.480> take<00:04:34.660> over

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
sucking than Kwame is gonna take over

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.680 
sucking than Kwame is gonna take over
because<00:04:35.610> sake<00:04:36.610> horses<00:04:36.910> are<00:04:37.030> usually<00:04:37.360> weaker

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
because sake horses are usually weaker

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.190 
because sake horses are usually weaker
and<00:04:38.070> that's<00:04:39.070> what<00:04:39.220> comedy<00:04:39.490> thinks<00:04:40.200> Kwame

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
and that's what comedy thinks Kwame

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.270 
and that's what comedy thinks Kwame
sighs<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.960> aggression<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.230> actually<00:04:44.680> kid<00:04:45.040> she

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
sighs and aggression is actually kid she

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.730 
sighs and aggression is actually kid she
can<00:04:45.310> actually<00:04:45.580> overpower<00:04:46.090> oops<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:47.380> let's

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
can actually overpower oops but let's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.480 
can actually overpower oops but let's
see<00:04:47.950> who<00:04:48.190> will<00:04:48.370> be<00:04:48.400> leaving<00:04:48.850> um<00:04:50.370> diode<00:04:51.370> is
