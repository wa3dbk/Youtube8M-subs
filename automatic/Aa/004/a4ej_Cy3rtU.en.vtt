problems when I find press so but if I
look<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> section<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.420> there's<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
look at this section I can see there's a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.460 
look at this section I can see there's a
slate<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:30.140> which<00:00:31.140> could

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
slate kind of it's just which could

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
slate kind of it's just which could
cause<00:00:31.740> problems<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.489> mean<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> third<00:00:33.149> day<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
cause problems I mean the third day you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
cause problems I mean the third day you
could<00:00:33.719> end<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.140> feeling<00:00:34.440> binding<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
could end up with a feeling binding and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
could end up with a feeling binding and
the<00:00:35.160> housing<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> comes<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> an<00:00:36.540> angle<00:00:36.840> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the housing if it comes at an angle so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.470 
the housing if it comes at an angle so
what<00:00:37.440> I'm<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.300> to

your answer there I'm gonna take a piece

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.860 
your answer there I'm gonna take a piece
of<00:00:45.770> sanity<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:48.620> get<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.710> Ella<00:00:49.950> -<00:00:50.129> oh

please
-<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.590> close<00:00:52.770> on<00:01:02.059> when<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> put<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> spacer

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
- pretty close on when I put the spacer

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.939 
- pretty close on when I put the spacer
on<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:04.379> sure<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.619> doesn't<00:01:04.799> go

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
on I want to make sure it doesn't go

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
on I want to make sure it doesn't go
past<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> let<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.450> goes<00:01:06.659> past<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
past this and let that goes past that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
past this and let that goes past that
look<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> building<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> being<00:01:08.310> pressed

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
look when the building is being pressed

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
look when the building is being pressed
that<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.390> bind<00:01:09.600> against<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> spacer

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that that will bind against the spacer

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
that that will bind against the spacer
obviously<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> spacer<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.760> jammed<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
obviously the spacer will be jammed and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.640 
obviously the spacer will be jammed and
the<00:01:12.360> vise

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.190 

know<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.900> now

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
know if I take it and I put it on now

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
know if I take it and I put it on now
you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.939> very<00:01:21.780> close<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you can see that's very very close to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
you can see that's very very close to
being<00:01:22.170> straight<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> next<00:01:24.090> stage<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
being straight so the next stage is to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
being straight so the next stage is to
take<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> best<00:01:25.680> component<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.790> fits<00:01:27.030> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
take the best component which fits in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.950 
take the best component which fits in
the<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:28.520> take<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.810> whole

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the back you can take that the whole

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
the back you can take that the whole
thing<00:01:37.259> into<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> vase<00:01:43.159> I'd<00:01:44.159> find<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> easier

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
thing into the vase I'd find it easier

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
thing into the vase I'd find it easier
working<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.200> specific<00:01:46.649> tools<00:01:46.890> for

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
working with you know specific tools for

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.469 
working with you know specific tools for
buildings<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.299> clap

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
buildings because you don't have to clap

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
buildings because you don't have to clap
about<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.110> far<00:01:49.320> less<00:01:49.380> costly<00:01:49.829> damage

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
about and there's far less costly damage

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
about and there's far less costly damage
on<00:01:50.490> once<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> point<00:01:51.840> where

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you want it to be have a look around it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.959 
you want it to be have a look around it
you<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:54.990> visually<00:01:55.649> check<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.759> it's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you know just visually check about it's
