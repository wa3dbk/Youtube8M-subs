00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
candidates based on my budget are the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.429 
candidates based on my budget are the
Canon<00:00:24.810> 70<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> 200<00:00:25.529> f28<00:00:26.070> l9<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.930> Sigma

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Canon 70 to 200 f28 l9 is and the Sigma

70 to 200 f28 OS I usually shoot

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709 
70 to 200 f28 OS I usually shoot
outdoors<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> version<00:00:33.570> from

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
outdoors so I think the is version from

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
outdoors so I think the is version from
Canon<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.469> fine<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:35.010> think<00:00:35.430> he<00:00:35.489> means

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
Canon will do just fine I think he means

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
Canon will do just fine I think he means

I owned it for Nikon and I've shot it on
Canon<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> past<00:01:19.580> might<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.700> been<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Canon in the past might have been the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.990 
Canon in the past might have been the
earlier<00:01:21.240> version<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> lens<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> I've

I've<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:28.860> shot<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.640> cannon<00:01:30.299> 70<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> 200<00:01:31.850> f28

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I've also shot the cannon 70 to 200 f28

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.140 
I've also shot the cannon 70 to 200 f28
is<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.100> haven't<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.759> I've<00:01:35.850> shot

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
is and I haven't don't think I've shot

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.950 
is and I haven't don't think I've shot
the<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.229> l9<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.640> arguably<00:01:39.479> they're<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the the l9 is but arguably they're the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.710 
the the l9 is but arguably they're the
same<00:01:40.610> optics<00:01:41.610> anyways<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.360> basically

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
same optics anyways I think basically

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.569 
same optics anyways I think basically
it's<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> motors<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> difference

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it's just the is motors the difference

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's just the is motors the difference
in<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.210> budget

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
in here so my take on this is if budget

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.740 
in here so my take on this is if budget
is<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> concern<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.979> go<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> Sigma

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
is a concern you go with the Sigma

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
is a concern you go with the Sigma
there's<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.710> doubt<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.970> Canon

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there's no doubt about it that the Canon

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
there's no doubt about it that the Canon
70<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> 200<00:01:55.790> f28<00:01:56.960> both<00:01:57.960> both<00:01:58.439> al<00:01:58.649> versions<00:01:59.070> the

is<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.420> think<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.660> fluorite<00:02:52.160> components<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
is I think the fluorite components of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.540 
is I think the fluorite components of
the<00:02:53.340> lens<00:02:53.550> elements<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:55.070> DG<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.100> think<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.520> a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
the lens elements and DG I think was a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.820 
the lens elements and DG I think was a
digital<00:02:56.820> designation<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.780> gave<00:02:57.990> things<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
digital designation they gave things so

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.820 
digital designation they gave things so
in<00:02:58.950> any<00:02:59.040> case<00:02:59.160> um<00:03:00.560> 1199<00:03:01.970> 1199<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.660> Sigma<00:03:04.200> 70<00:03:04.710> to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
in any case um 1199 1199 for Sigma 70 to

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.900 
in any case um 1199 1199 for Sigma 70 to
200<00:03:05.070> f28<00:03:05.790> os<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> again<00:03:08.100> we<00:03:08.280> compare<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
200 f28 os so again we compare that to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.310 
200 f28 os so again we compare that to
the<00:03:10.520> 1449<00:03:11.520> for<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> canons<00:03:12.720> non<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:14.160> or<00:03:15.320> $24.99

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
the 1449 for the canons non is or $24.99

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.220 
the 1449 for the canons non is or $24.99
now<00:03:16.920> price<00:03:17.820> alone<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.690> Sigma<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.170> a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
now price alone the Sigma is a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.880 
now price alone the Sigma is a
no-brainer

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
no-brainer

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.130 
no-brainer
but<00:03:20.190> then<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.580> gotta<00:03:20.760> ask<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.690> about<00:03:21.870> image

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
but then you gotta ask what about image

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.400 
but then you gotta ask what about image
quality<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.880> tell<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.660> 70<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

200 f28 from Sigma has always been a

200 f28 from Sigma has always been a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
very very good performer even back in

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.580 
very very good performer even back in
the<00:03:31.350> days<00:03:31.830> when<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.190> didn't<00:03:32.430> even<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.590> OS

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the days when we didn't even have a OS

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.130 
the days when we didn't even have a OS
version<00:03:35.040> from<00:03:35.250> Sigma<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.450> really<00:03:36.959> don't

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
version from Sigma so I really don't

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.570 
version from Sigma so I really don't
think<00:03:37.230> you're<00:03:37.590> gonna<00:03:37.739> lose<00:03:38.070> anything

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
think you're gonna lose anything

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.960 
think you're gonna lose anything
optically<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:41.100> know<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.489> look<00:03:41.640> at<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
optically you know you can look at the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.060 
optically you know you can look at the
the<00:03:42.420> performance<00:03:42.780> test<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:43.500> over<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.709> photos

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the performance test go over to photos

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.380 
the performance test go over to photos
own<00:03:44.250> D<00:03:44.700> they've<00:03:45.060> got<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.200> they<00:03:46.350> measure<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
own D they've got so they measure the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.820 
own D they've got so they measure the
sharpness<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.780> lens<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.290> put<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> through

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
sharpness of the lens and put it through

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.620 
sharpness of the lens and put it through
a<00:03:49.920> few<00:03:50.130> other<00:03:50.280> tests<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.150> you'll<00:03:51.300> see

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
a few other tests and I think you'll see

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.130 
a few other tests and I think you'll see
that<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.739> Sigma<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.430> very<00:03:54.030> comparable<00:03:54.600> lens

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
that the Sigma is a very comparable lens

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.979 
that the Sigma is a very comparable lens
and<00:03:55.470> you're<00:03:56.370> saving<00:03:56.760> an<00:03:57.000> awful<00:03:57.540> lot<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.720> money

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
and you're saving an awful lot of money

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.979 
and you're saving an awful lot of money

lens<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.340> OS<00:04:20.700> works<00:04:21.000> very<00:04:21.299> well<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
lens the OS works very well in it I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.380 
lens the OS works very well in it I
would<00:04:22.080> say<00:04:22.229> it's<00:04:22.380> comparable<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:24.090> from

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
would say it's comparable to the is from

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.900 
would say it's comparable to the is from
Canon<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.830> know<00:04:25.950> its<00:04:26.460> basic

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
Canon you know its basic

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.790 
Canon you know its basic
on<00:04:27.090> par<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:29.430> never<00:04:29.700> unhappy<00:04:30.480> with<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
on par and I was never unhappy with the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.930 
on par and I was never unhappy with the
Sigma<00:04:32.430> 70<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.030> 200<00:04:33.240> f28<00:04:33.960> Oh<00:04:34.110> s<00:04:34.400> very<00:04:35.400> very<00:04:35.550> nice

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
Sigma 70 to 200 f28 Oh s very very nice

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.710 
Sigma 70 to 200 f28 Oh s very very nice
lens<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.650> certainly<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:38.010> really<00:04:38.910> good<00:04:39.120> value

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
lens and certainly a really good value

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.160 
lens and certainly a really good value
in<00:04:39.900> comparison<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.220> canon<00:04:41.550> lenses<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.360> my

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
in comparison to the canon lenses so my

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.960 
in comparison to the canon lenses so my
answer<00:04:43.470> there<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.860> if<00:04:44.250> budget<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:44.940> a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
answer there is that if budget is a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.450 
answer there is that if budget is a
concern<00:04:45.480> definitely<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.470> Sigma<00:04:46.920> is<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.100> great

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
concern definitely the Sigma is a great

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.520 
concern definitely the Sigma is a great
lens<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.120> great<00:04:48.390> price

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
lens and a great price

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.830 
lens and a great price
you<00:04:50.040> know<00:04:50.160> budgets<00:04:50.610> almost<00:04:50.850> always<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.360> concern

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
you know budgets almost always a concern

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.900 
you know budgets almost always a concern
if<00:04:52.080> you've<00:04:52.350> got<00:04:52.530> an<00:04:52.620> unlimited<00:04:52.980> budget<00:04:53.340> by<00:04:53.760> all

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
if you've got an unlimited budget by all

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.480 
if you've got an unlimited budget by all
means<00:04:54.180> go<00:04:54.630> with<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.930> Canon<00:04:55.320> you're<00:04:56.280> going<00:04:56.430> to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
means go with the Canon you're going to

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.920 
means go with the Canon you're going to
find<00:04:56.760> though<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:56.940> even<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> Sigma<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
find though that even the Sigma the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.070 
find though that even the Sigma the
retail<00:04:58.530> are<00:04:59.430> not<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.000> retail<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.660> resale

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
retail are not the retail but the resale

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.400 
retail are not the retail but the resale
value<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.950> Sigma<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.460> still<00:05:02.820> very<00:05:03.150> good

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
value on the Sigma is still very good

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.770 
value on the Sigma is still very good
these<00:05:04.410> are<00:05:04.440> very<00:05:04.740> good<00:05:04.950> lenses<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:06.750> I

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
these are very good lenses and so I

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.350 
these are very good lenses and so I
would<00:05:07.050> recommend<00:05:07.230> Ronnie<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.760> with<00:05:09.030> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
would recommend Ronnie to go with the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.580 
would recommend Ronnie to go with the
Sigma<00:05:10.260> 70<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.890> 200<00:05:11.100> os<00:05:11.670> I<00:05:12.510> wouldn't<00:05:13.110> get<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
Sigma 70 to 200 os I wouldn't get the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.180 
Sigma 70 to 200 os I wouldn't get the
non<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:14.730> canon<00:05:15.330> simply<00:05:15.780> because<00:05:16.140> with<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> 70<00:05:17.100> to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
non is canon simply because with a 70 to

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.900 
non is canon simply because with a 70 to
200<00:05:17.400> zoom<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:18.360> really<00:05:18.840> do<00:05:19.400> benefit<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.460> lot

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
200 zoom you really do benefit a lot

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.140 
200 zoom you really do benefit a lot
from<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.660> image<00:05:21.870> stabilization<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:23.150> you're

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
from the image stabilization and you're

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.600 
from the image stabilization and you're
not<00:05:24.300> giving<00:05:24.690> up<00:05:24.810> anything<00:05:25.110> in<00:05:25.560> quality<00:05:26.280> going

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
not giving up anything in quality going

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.070 
not giving up anything in quality going
with<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.910> Sigma<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:27.690> that's<00:05:27.900> my

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
with the Sigma so that's my

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.130 
with the Sigma so that's my
recommendation<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:29.100> Ronnie<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:30.140> viewers
