00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
more gun kills which is I don't know

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240 
more gun kills which is I don't know
it's<00:02:33.840> good<00:02:34.170> i<00:02:34.200> guess<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.650> i've<00:02:34.770> been<00:02:34.800> trying

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
it's good i guess and i've been trying

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's good i guess and i've been trying
to<00:02:35.400> use<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> little<00:02:35.850> bit<00:02:35.940> more<00:02:36.090> variety<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:37.200> my

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
to use a little bit more variety in my

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.090 
to use a little bit more variety in my
gameplays<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.600> used<00:02:39.810> swarm<00:02:40.320> k-9<00:02:40.860> unit

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
gameplays like not used swarm k-9 unit

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.199 
gameplays like not used swarm k-9 unit
visa<00:02:41.250> i'm<00:02:41.430> trying<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> mix<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.180> little

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
visa i'm trying to mix it up a little

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.540 
visa i'm trying to mix it up a little
bit<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.540> way<00:02:42.720> see<00:02:42.990> me<00:02:43.170> use<00:02:43.320> escort<00:02:43.770> drone<00:02:44.010> k-9

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
bit this way see me use escort drone k-9

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.580 
bit this way see me use escort drone k-9
unit<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.030> also<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:45.810> many<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.080> asking<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
unit and also so many just asking in the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.080 
unit and also so many just asking in the
comments<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> video<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.580> i<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.910> took

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
comments on the video that i just took

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.960 
comments on the video that i just took
down<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> vector<00:02:49.980> compared

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
down is do you like the vector compared

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.300 
down is do you like the vector compared
to<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.959> scorpion<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.680> think<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> vectors

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
to this the scorpion I think the vectors

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.890 
to this the scorpion I think the vectors
probably<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.640> second<00:02:53.970> best<00:02:54.030> SMG<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> game

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
probably the second best SMG in the game

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.020 
probably the second best SMG in the game
you<00:02:55.709> want<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> use<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> cinematic<00:02:56.610> silencer<00:02:57.000> i

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
you want to use a cinematic silencer i

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.580 
you want to use a cinematic silencer i
don't<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.420> unlocked<00:02:57.750> yet<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> ps3

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
don't have it unlocked yet on the ps3

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.190 
don't have it unlocked yet on the ps3
but<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.220> cinematic<00:03:00.000> silencer<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.810> really

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
but a cinematic silencer is a really

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.930 
but a cinematic silencer is a really
good<00:03:01.410> gun<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.890> doesn't<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> lot<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.700> recoil

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
good gun it doesn't have a lot of recoil

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.360 
good gun it doesn't have a lot of recoil
I<00:03:03.420> think<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> PDW<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.950> little<00:03:05.190> bit<00:03:05.280> better

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
I think the PDW is a little bit better

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.770 
I think the PDW is a little bit better
but<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> vector<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.090> probably<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.600> bit

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but the vector is probably a little bit

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.720 
but the vector is probably a little bit
better<00:03:07.020> for<00:03:07.320> medium<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.830> long<00:03:08.100> range<00:03:08.130> shots

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
better for medium to long range shots

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.080 
better for medium to long range shots
I'm<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:10.380> there's<00:03:10.590> barely<00:03:10.950> any<00:03:11.250> recon<00:03:11.730> so

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
I'm not like there's barely any recon so

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.130 
I'm not like there's barely any recon so
if<00:03:12.150> you're<00:03:12.239> having<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.780> you're<00:03:12.930> having<00:03:13.050> a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
if you're having if you're having a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.900 
if you're having if you're having a
little<00:03:13.260> time<00:03:13.770> struggling<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.520> game<00:03:14.670> try

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
little time struggling with the game try

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.000 
little time struggling with the game try
out<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> PDW<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.560> vector<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
out the PDW in the and the vector the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.259 
out the PDW in the and the vector the
vector<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> little<00:03:17.880> bit<00:03:18.090> better

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
vector is actually a little bit better

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.870 
vector is actually a little bit better
than<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> PDW<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.320> use<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> vector<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.640> bigger

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
than the PDW so use a vector on bigger

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.750 
than the PDW so use a vector on bigger
maps<00:03:21.260> use<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.410> PDW<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.100> smaller<00:03:23.370> maps<00:03:23.580> like

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
maps use the PDW on smaller maps like

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220 
maps use the PDW on smaller maps like
drones<00:03:24.000> are<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.360> good<00:03:24.480> master<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> vector

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
drones are really good master the vector

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.170 
drones are really good master the vector
because<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.739> doesn't<00:03:26.070> have<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.220> lot<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> recoil

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
because it doesn't have a lot of recoil

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.020 
because it doesn't have a lot of recoil
from<00:03:27.720> far<00:03:28.019> away<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.320> oh<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.580> little<00:03:29.820> tip

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
from far away so oh that's a little tip

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.420 
from far away so oh that's a little tip
in<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.450> commentary<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> said<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.890> like

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
in this commentary like I said it's like

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270 
in this commentary like I said it's like
a<00:03:32.810> 103<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.930> what<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> hundred<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.190> eighty

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
a 103 and what is a hundred and eighty

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.500 
a 103 and what is a hundred and eighty
degree<00:03:35.580> turn<00:03:35.610> from<00:03:36.030> what<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> was<00:03:36.360> talking
