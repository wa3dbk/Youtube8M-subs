00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.370 
finger on the 7th fret third string and
I'm<00:02:13.989> stretching<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.500> exactly<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> tone<00:02:16.380> here's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
I'm stretching it exactly a tone here's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.080 
I'm stretching it exactly a tone here's
the<00:02:17.560> next<00:02:17.709> note<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> scale<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.520> if<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.940> go

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
the next note in a scale like if I go

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:32.820 
the next note in a scale like if I go
through<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.450> scale<00:02:31.080> that's<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.200> pitch<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.560> want

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
through the scale that's a pitch I want

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.660 
through the scale that's a pitch I want
right<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.269> e<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.980> now<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.459> stretch

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
right the e so now I'm going to stretch

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
right the e so now I'm going to stretch
up<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.500> e<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.980> while<00:02:39.940> I'm<00:02:40.090> holding<00:02:40.360> e

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.290 

it's<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.590> cool<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.130> then<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.640> creates<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.090> C

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
it's not cool so then that creates the C

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:01.430 
it's not cool so then that creates the C
chord<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.510> very<00:02:52.540> good<00:02:52.750> riff<00:02:53.049> for<00:02:53.200> that
