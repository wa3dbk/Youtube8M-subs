00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.820 
or sides as you notice as we rotate it
around<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.770> image<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.460> some<00:02:11.790> yeah<00:02:12.780> those<00:02:13.560> are

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
around the image get some yeah those are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.640 
around the image get some yeah those are
core

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
core

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.330 
core
so<00:02:15.390> yeah<00:02:16.390> we're<00:02:16.750> gonna<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:18.310> sure

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
so yeah we're gonna have to make sure

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.400 
so yeah we're gonna have to make sure
that<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.270> just<00:02:19.420> right<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.780> make<00:02:20.260> sure

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
that we get it just right to make sure

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.950 
that we get it just right to make sure
everything<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.070> level<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:22.570> course<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
everything is level and of course you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.950 
everything is level and of course you
have<00:02:23.110> your<00:02:23.430> green<00:02:24.430> yellow<00:02:24.730> red<00:02:24.880> lines<00:02:25.390> which

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
have your green yellow red lines which

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.920 
have your green yellow red lines which
work<00:02:26.560> pretty<00:02:26.980> well<00:02:27.100> as<00:02:27.940> my<00:02:28.240> finger<00:02:28.660> almost

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
work pretty well as my finger almost

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.030 
work pretty well as my finger almost
hits<00:02:29.320> red<00:02:30.180> into<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.210> red<00:02:31.510> about<00:02:32.230> an<00:02:32.410> inch<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
hits red into the red about an inch and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.200 
hits red into the red about an inch and
a<00:02:33.100> half<00:02:33.240> maybe<00:02:34.500> maybe<00:02:35.500> two<00:02:35.890> inches<00:02:36.190> from<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
a half maybe maybe two inches from the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.570 
a half maybe maybe two inches from the
camera<00:02:37.600> itself<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.770> gonna<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.130> pretty

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
camera itself so that's gonna be pretty

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.040 
camera itself so that's gonna be pretty
accurate

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
accurate

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.960 
accurate
see<00:02:41.590> if<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.770> can<00:02:41.920> actually<00:02:42.040> get<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.580> shot<00:02:42.940> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
see if I can actually get you a shot of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.610 
see if I can actually get you a shot of
the<00:02:43.360> cam<00:02:43.600> itself<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.709> my<00:02:44.860> phone<00:02:46.260> which<00:02:47.260> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the cam itself and my phone which this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.420 
the cam itself and my phone which this
is<00:02:47.800> kind<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.190> awkward<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.770> ya<00:02:50.770> see<00:02:51.250> my

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
is kind of awkward to do ya see my

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.490 
is kind of awkward to do ya see my
rigged<00:02:51.910> up<00:02:52.060> wiring<00:02:52.480> there<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:55.140> anyway<00:02:56.140> there's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
rigged up wiring there so anyway there's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.410 
rigged up wiring there so anyway there's
my<00:02:56.680> phone<00:02:58.020> see<00:02:59.020> if<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.770> up<00:02:59.920> here<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:00.370> right

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.420 

okay<00:03:04.420> there<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:05.530> too<00:03:05.770> busy<00:03:06.070> looking<00:03:06.220> at

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
okay there we go I'm too busy looking at

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.610 
okay there we go I'm too busy looking at
radio<00:03:06.790> screen<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.720> there's<00:03:07.959> our<00:03:08.080> camera<00:03:08.470> is

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
radio screen so there's our camera is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949 
radio screen so there's our camera is
about<00:03:09.190> sighs<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.940> said<00:03:10.270> about<00:03:10.450> size<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.900> a

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
about sighs I said about size of a

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.370 
about sighs I said about size of a
quarter

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
quarter

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.180 
quarter
it<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.459> very<00:03:12.700> small<00:03:13.800> Council<00:03:14.800> it's<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.980> length

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it is very small Council it's the length

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.729 
it is very small Council it's the length
of<00:03:15.370> wire<00:03:15.580> here<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.270> there's<00:03:17.230> gonna<00:03:17.410> be<00:03:17.620> our

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
of wire here and there's gonna be our

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.680 
of wire here and there's gonna be our
little<00:03:17.950> resistor<00:03:18.580> pack<00:03:18.820> now<00:03:19.060> one<00:03:19.239> thing<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.540> am

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
little resistor pack now one thing I am

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.220 
little resistor pack now one thing I am
noticing<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.120> resistor<00:03:22.690> pack<00:03:22.959> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
noticing is that this resistor pack is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.509 
noticing is that this resistor pack is
getting<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.280> warm<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:26.519> hopefully

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
getting a little warm so hopefully

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.000 
getting a little warm so hopefully
that's<00:03:27.820> gonna<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.420> okay<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:29.140> no<00:03:29.470> idea<00:03:29.830> what

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
that's gonna be okay I have no idea what

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.949 
that's gonna be okay I have no idea what
size<00:03:30.190> resistors<00:03:30.850> are<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.120> there<00:03:31.360> but<00:03:31.720> it's

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
size resistors are in there but it's

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.560 
size resistors are in there but it's
pretty<00:03:32.500> warm<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.790> now<00:03:33.940> we're<00:03:34.090> gonna<00:03:34.239> stick

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
pretty warm and now we're gonna stick

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.949 
pretty warm and now we're gonna stick
the<00:03:34.720> camera<00:03:34.959> into<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:36.090> very<00:03:37.090> dimly<00:03:37.510> lit

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
the camera into a very dimly lit

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.320 
the camera into a very dimly lit
location<00:03:38.830> here<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:40.600> not<00:03:41.110> doing<00:03:41.560> too<00:03:41.739> bad

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
location here and it's not doing too bad

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.860 
location here and it's not doing too bad
yeah<00:03:43.330> saw<00:03:43.630> my<00:03:43.870> rigged<00:03:44.680> up<00:03:44.830> wiring<00:03:45.280> here<00:03:45.549> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
yeah saw my rigged up wiring here to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.440 
yeah saw my rigged up wiring here to
show<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.930> guys<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.470> camera<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:49.180> about

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
show you guys to camera and that's about

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.959 
show you guys to camera and that's about
it
