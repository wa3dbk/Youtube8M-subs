00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the hotspot at all so here with me today

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.429

I have an AT&amp;T Samsung Galaxy s5 active

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.580 
I have an AT&amp;T Samsung Galaxy s5 active
you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.549> pop<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.479> phone<00:01:12.840> settings<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you can pop in the phone settings and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.640 
you can pop in the phone settings and
see<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.010> information<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
see that information there so you take a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.710 
see that information there so you take a
look<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> model<00:01:17.790> number<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
look at the model number there that is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280 
look at the model number there that is
going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> show<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> g8<00:01:20.270> 7-0<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
going to show as the g8 7-0 a which is

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.780 
going to show as the g8 7-0 a which is
the<00:01:22.439> s5<00:01:22.979> active<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.880> AT&amp;T<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.490> focus

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the s5 active on AT&amp;T and so my focus

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.600 
the s5 active on AT&amp;T and so my focus
kicks<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:30.500> let<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.250> coax

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
kicks in there let me see if I can coax

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.660 
kicks in there let me see if I can coax
that<00:01:32.909> along<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.420> bit

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.050 

there<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.730> go

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
there we go

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
there we go
so<00:01:39.270> 878<00:01:40.230> that's<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.220> AT&amp;T<00:01:41.790> s5<00:01:42.570> active<00:01:42.870> this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so 878 that's the AT&amp;T s5 active this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
so 878 that's the AT&amp;T s5 active this
one<00:01:43.920> though<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.580> unlocked<00:01:45.120> for<00:01:45.420> use<00:01:45.630> on

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
one though I have unlocked for use on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.750 
one though I have unlocked for use on
other<00:01:46.320> carriers<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.730> my

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
other carriers and right now I have my

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.990 
other carriers and right now I have my

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
own t-mobile SIM inside of it so when

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.570 
own t-mobile SIM inside of it so when
you<00:01:51.060> take<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> look<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.200> lock<00:01:52.950> screen<00:01:53.340> there

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
you take a look at the lock screen there

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.220 
you take a look at the lock screen there
we<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.120> that<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.450> t-mobile<00:01:54.870> up<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
we can see that we have t-mobile up in

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.780 
we can see that we have t-mobile up in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
ATM T's restrictions if I go and jump

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.230 
ATM T's restrictions if I go and jump
into<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.320> hotspot<00:02:04.860> settings<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.580> try<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.910> use

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
into the hotspot settings and try to use

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.160 
into the hotspot settings and try to use
it<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:08.090> get<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> message<00:02:09.330> down<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.990> bottom

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it I get a message down at the bottom

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
it I get a message down at the bottom
that<00:02:10.440> says<00:02:10.679> mobile<00:02:11.100> data<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.790> available

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that says mobile data is not available

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.680 
that says mobile data is not available
or<00:02:12.860> invalid<00:02:13.860> sim<00:02:14.160> well<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> obviously<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.450> my

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
or invalid sim well I obviously have my

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.060 
or invalid sim well I obviously have my
data<00:02:15.870> connection<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.040> can

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
data connection right there as we can

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.250 
data connection right there as we can
see<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> fact<00:02:18.510> must<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
see so then the fact must be that it's

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.470 
see so then the fact must be that it's
an<00:02:19.380> invalid<00:02:19.980> sim<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> was<00:02:21.330> saying

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
an invalid sim and like I was saying

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
an invalid sim and like I was saying
before<00:02:21.660> that's<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.500> TN<00:02:22.860> t--'s<00:02:23.130> method<00:02:23.580> of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
before that's a TN t--'s method of

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.150 
before that's a TN t--'s method of
blocking<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> hotspot<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.860> using

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
blocking the hotspot because I'm using

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.100 
blocking the hotspot because I'm using
the<00:02:26.370> phone<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.820> provider<00:02:27.240> other<00:02:27.840> than

but my business offers services where I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.680 
but my business offers services where I
can<00:02:31.440> get<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.830> hotspot<00:02:32.100> enabled<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.360> if

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
can get that hotspot enabled for you if

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
can get that hotspot enabled for you if
you're<00:02:34.080> using<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> phone<00:02:35.010> otherwise

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you're using it on a phone otherwise

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.510 
you're using it on a phone otherwise
whereby<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.840> restricted<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.310> that's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
whereby it's restricted so that's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.710 
whereby it's restricted so that's
something<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.910> I've<00:02:39.000> done<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.480> phone

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
something that I've done to this phone

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.020 
something that I've done to this phone
here<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.100> one<00:02:41.310> quick<00:02:41.520> reboot

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
here I just have to do one quick reboot

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.900 
here I just have to do one quick reboot
to<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.540> we'll<00:02:43.050> be<00:02:43.170> able<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to it and we'll be able to see that the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.510 
to it and we'll be able to see that the
hotspot<00:02:45.390> does<00:02:45.690> work<00:02:46.020> after<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.190> phone's<00:02:47.400> been

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
hotspot does work after the phone's been

00:02:47.520 --> 00:03:15.680 
hotspot does work after the phone's been
rebooted<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.900> give<00:02:49.020> me<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:49.380> second<00:02:49.920> here

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.540 

this<00:03:16.440> might<00:03:16.620> take<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> little<00:03:17.040> bit<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.490> can

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
this might take a little bit so you can

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.070 
this might take a little bit so you can
skip<00:03:17.850> ahead<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.270> end<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> video<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:18.990> if
