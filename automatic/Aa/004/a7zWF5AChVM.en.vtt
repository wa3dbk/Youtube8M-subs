scrimmage<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.450> thought<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.570> office<00:01:11.900> came<00:01:12.140> out

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
scrimmage I thought the office came out

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.780 
scrimmage I thought the office came out
and<00:01:12.440> played<00:01:12.530> extremely<00:01:12.980> well<00:01:13.130> especially<00:01:13.550> in

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the beginning of it a second scrimmage I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.900 
the beginning of it a second scrimmage I
thought<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.670> defense<00:01:17.150> had<00:01:17.330> better<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.900> and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
thought the defense had better that and
