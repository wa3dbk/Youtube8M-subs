quite a lot and I do appreciate it now
formula<00:00:25.080> match<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:26.010> function<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.000> s<00:00:27.240> net<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
formula match is a function of s net it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
formula match is a function of s net it
gives<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> ability<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.980> write<00:00:29.279> down<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
gives you the ability to write down a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.209 
gives you the ability to write down a
formula<00:00:29.820> freehand<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.720> s<00:00:31.439> note<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.890> will<00:00:32.040> then

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
formula freehand on s note it will then

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.459 
formula freehand on s note it will then
and<00:00:32.430> recognize<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.690> you've<00:00:33.840> written<00:00:34.140> down

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
and recognize what you've written down

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.830 
and recognize what you've written down
and<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and then you have the you have the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
and then you have the you have the
ability<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.410> search<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ability to search for that on the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
ability to search for that on the
Wolfram<00:00:39.570> Alpha<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.910> website<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.690> could

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
Wolfram Alpha and website and it could

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.569 
Wolfram Alpha and website and it could
actually<00:00:43.410> work<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.460> well

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
actually work that out for you as well

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.279 
actually work that out for you as well
so<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> try<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> few<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.480> now

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
so we're going to try a few things now

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
so we're going to try a few things now
all<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.340> zoom<00:00:47.550> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
all you do is I'm just going to zoom in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.110 
all you do is I'm just going to zoom in
so<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.719> doing<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:50.120> now

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so you can see what I'm doing there now

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
so you can see what I'm doing there now
and<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> access<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and what you do is the way you access it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.389 
and what you do is the way you access it
is<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.489> select<00:00:54.149> s<00:00:54.690> note<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.129> go

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
is you select s note and then you go

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.779 
is you select s note and then you go
over<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.109> this<00:00:58.109> function<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> email

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
over to this function here and I email

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
over to this function here and I email
your<00:00:59.940> may<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:02.210> displayed<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.110> all

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
your may not be displayed as that all

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.399 
your may not be displayed as that all
you<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> hold<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.820> button<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> then

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you do is hold down that button and then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.510 
you do is hold down that button and then
select<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.810> TF<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:14.310> brings

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
select the TF there and then it brings

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.810 
select the TF there and then it brings
up<00:01:14.790> its<00:01:15.180> better<00:01:15.509> displays<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
up its better displays it like this so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
up its better displays it like this so
basically<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.490> write<00:01:20.700> your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
basically all you do is you write your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
basically all you do is you write your
function<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.259> show<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
function here it will then show you and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
function here it will then show you and
what<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.170> give<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
what it is here then it will give you an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.510 
what it is here then it will give you an
option<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.920> search<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.200> for<00:01:28.200> whatever<00:01:28.920> answer

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
option to search and for whatever answer

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
option to search and for whatever answer
or<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> function<00:01:31.740> or

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
or if it is actually a function or

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
or if it is actually a function or
formula<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.479> obviously<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
formula and then obviously you have the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.609 
formula and then obviously you have the
option<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> insert<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> digital<00:01:35.840> text<00:01:36.840> if

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
option to insert it as a digital text if

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.140 
option to insert it as a digital text if
your<00:01:37.860> handwriting<00:01:38.310> isn't<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
your handwriting isn't that good and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
your handwriting isn't that good and
also<00:01:39.509> clearly<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.350> well<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.829> we're<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
also clearly as well so we're going to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
also clearly as well so we're going to
try<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> few<00:01:41.549> things<00:01:41.610> now<00:01:42.030> first<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
try a few things now first of all and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
try a few things now first of all and
i'm<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.159> mathematician<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.060> i

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
i'm not really a mathematician so i

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.410 
i'm not really a mathematician so i
wouldn't<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.930> any<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.030> every<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.060> any

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
wouldn't know any of the every other any

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
wouldn't know any of the every other any
other<00:01:48.659> complex<00:01:49.259> formulas<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
other complex formulas so we're just

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
other complex formulas so we're just
going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> try<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.700> simple<00:01:51.119> ones<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.600> first

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
going to try some simple ones so first

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.130 
going to try some simple ones so first
of<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.939> formula<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.600> water<00:01:58.640> h2o<00:01:59.640> right

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
of all the formula for water h2o right

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
of all the formula for water h2o right
and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> did<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and then what you did to do is and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
and then what you did to do is and
select<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.799> search<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> get

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
more information about that the screen

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
more information about that the screen
then<00:02:08.700> goes<00:02:08.940> into<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.569> discreet<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.200> the

then goes into more discreet on the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.340 
then goes into more discreet on the
right<00:02:10.920> you'll<00:02:11.160> have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
right you'll have

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.530 
right you'll have
the<00:02:13.350> websites<00:02:14.220> interpretation<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.270> what

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the websites interpretation of what

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
the websites interpretation of what
you've<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.110> down<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.610> can

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
you've just put down and then you can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.010 
you've just put down and then you can
obviously<00:02:17.850> search<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.840> more

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
obviously search for that and get more

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
obviously search for that and get more
information<00:02:19.230> about<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.510> okay<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.170> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
information about that okay and then you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
information about that okay and then you
can<00:02:23.250> actually<00:02:23.520> switch<00:02:23.970> over<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> windows<00:02:24.690> by

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
can actually switch over the windows by

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.070 
can actually switch over the windows by
holding<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.400> window<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.840> other

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
holding down the window here the other

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.220 
holding down the window here the other
side<00:02:28.320> will<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> will<00:02:29.910> deem<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.600> then

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
side will go and will deem out and then

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.070 
side will go and will deem out and then
you<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.590> drag<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.050> well

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
you can drag it over like that as well

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can drag it over like that as well
it<00:02:34.380> if<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.010> your<00:02:35.190> preference<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:36.420> course

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it if that's your preference of course

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.450 
it if that's your preference of course
so<00:02:37.380> what<00:02:37.500> I'm<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> move<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.250> back

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
so what I'm just going to move that back

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.270 
so what I'm just going to move that back
so<00:02:39.230> yet<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.560> mah<00:02:41.370> 20<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.240> then<00:02:42.840> they

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
so yet so that's mah 20 and then they

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.380 
so yet so that's mah 20 and then they
adjust<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.610> rid<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.940> not<00:02:45.210> what<00:02:45.360> you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
adjust to get rid of that not what you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.530 
adjust to get rid of that not what you
can<00:02:45.660> also<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.590> example<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:48.090> your

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
can also do is for example if you your

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.850 
can also do is for example if you your
handwriting<00:02:49.200> isn't<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.800> good<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:52.620> can

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
handwriting isn't as good and you can

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.000 
handwriting isn't as good and you can
for<00:02:53.760> example<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> comes<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.740> wrong

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
for example if it comes up in a wrong

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.370 
for example if it comes up in a wrong
way<00:02:56.040> something<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.000> don't<00:02:57.320> intend<00:02:58.320> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
way something that you don't intend to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
way something that you don't intend to
write<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.340> rub<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.790> with<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
write you can just rub it out with the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.740 
write you can just rub it out with the
verbal<00:03:00.690> function<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:02.420> put<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.630> again

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
verbal function and then put it in again

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.770 
verbal function and then put it in again
and<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.320> will<00:03:04.410> recognize<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.860> again<00:03:05.360> ok<00:03:06.360> so

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and it will recognize it again ok so

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.150 
and it will recognize it again ok so
we're<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> try<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.590> different<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:07.980> I'm

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
we're going to try a different one I'm

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.720 
we're going to try a different one I'm
just<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.520> take<00:03:08.760> all<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.660> off<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.730> also

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
just going to take all that off so also

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.290 
just going to take all that off so also
we're<00:03:12.600> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> try<00:03:13.050> e<00:03:13.920> equals<00:03:14.640> MC<00:03:15.000> squared

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
we're going to try e equals MC squared

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.070 
we're going to try e equals MC squared
because<00:03:15.990> Einsteins<00:03:17.150> conversion<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.270> mass<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
because Einsteins conversion of mass to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.210 
because Einsteins conversion of mass to
energy<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:20.030> i'm<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.360> type<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.750> e

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
energy so i'm just going to type in e

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
energy so i'm just going to type in e
equals<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.260> c<00:03:25.940> squared<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> then<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
equals and c squared so then it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220 
equals and c squared so then it
recognizes<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> straight<00:03:29.850> away<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.300> then<00:03:30.959> if

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
recognizes it straight away and then if

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.340 
recognizes it straight away and then if
i<00:03:31.380> search<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.239> on<00:03:33.239> their<00:03:34.140> database<00:03:36.350> it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
i search for that on their database it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.990 
i search for that on their database it
will<00:03:37.440> then<00:03:37.590> give<00:03:37.800> me<00:03:37.830> more<00:03:38.100> information<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
will then give me more information so

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.690 
will then give me more information so
basically<00:03:39.600> e<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:41.010> formula<00:03:41.340> equals

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
basically e in that formula equals

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
basically e in that formula equals
energy<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.900> his<00:03:43.880> mass<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.750> c<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
energy and his mass and the c is the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
energy and his mass and the c is the
speed<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:47.100> light<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.850> vacuum<00:03:48.209> i<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.989> no

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
speed of light in a vacuum i have no

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.170 
speed of light in a vacuum i have no
idea<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.709> means<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.310> i'm<00:03:50.580> presuming

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
idea what this means but i'm presuming

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.680 
idea what this means but i'm presuming
is<00:03:51.660> correct<00:03:52.050> because<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.760> seems<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.239> have

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
is correct because it seems to have

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.930 
is correct because it seems to have
found<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.350> formula<00:03:55.590> itself<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.370> gives<00:03:56.730> me<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
found the formula itself and gives me a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420 
found the formula itself and gives me a
little<00:03:57.030> calculator<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.739> kind<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.040> convert

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
little calculator to kind of convert

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.600 
little calculator to kind of convert
that<00:03:59.640> as<00:03:59.880> well<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.650> formula<00:04:02.250> match

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
that as well so that is a formula match

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.479 
that as well so that is a formula match
