00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
results so far since I do still have a

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.569 
results so far since I do still have a
month<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.940> go<00:00:49.090> before<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.660> do<00:00:49.750> my<00:00:49.840> one-year

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
month to go before I do my one-year

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.260 
month to go before I do my one-year
transformation<00:00:51.579> video<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.440> basically<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
transformation video so basically the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.270 
transformation video so basically the
only<00:00:55.300> thing<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.230> did<00:00:56.440> change<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:56.980> week

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
only thing that I did change this week

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.340 
only thing that I did change this week
was<00:00:57.820> my<00:00:58.210> calories<00:00:58.840> on<00:00:59.430> average<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.960> under

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
was my calories on average I was under

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.799 
was my calories on average I was under
100<00:01:02.980> grams<00:01:03.340> of<00:01:03.579> carbs<00:01:04.030> which<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.390> can<00:01:04.570> see

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
100 grams of carbs which you can see

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.109 
100 grams of carbs which you can see
here<00:01:05.080> didn't<00:01:05.500> really<00:01:05.800> cause<00:01:06.070> me<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.520> go<00:01:06.640> flat

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
here didn't really cause me to go flat

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.200 
here didn't really cause me to go flat
or<00:01:07.420> anything<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:09.190> just<00:01:09.610> kind<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.940> had<00:01:10.090> to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
or anything but I just kind of had to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.840 
or anything but I just kind of had to
lower<00:01:10.450> my<00:01:10.660> calories<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.410> compensate<00:01:12.130> for<00:01:12.610> my

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
lower my calories to compensate for my

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.180 
lower my calories to compensate for my
less<00:01:13.060> intense<00:01:13.479> training<00:01:13.869> routine<00:01:14.470> because<00:01:15.160> I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
less intense training routine because I

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.919 
less intense training routine because I
have<00:01:16.060> been<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:16.600> 6<00:01:16.959> though<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.940> did<00:01:19.509> that<00:01:19.750> and

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
have been so 6 though so I did that and

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.469 
have been so 6 though so I did that and
it<00:01:20.050> worked<00:01:20.200> out<00:01:20.470> well<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.970> one<00:01:22.119> thing<00:01:22.360> I

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
it worked out well but the one thing I

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.960 
it worked out well but the one thing I
did<00:01:22.690> notice<00:01:22.899> was<00:01:23.709> there<00:01:24.280> were<00:01:24.429> couple<00:01:24.789> days

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
did notice was there were couple days

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.320 
did notice was there were couple days
where<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.479> ate<00:01:25.899> before<00:01:26.530> my<00:01:27.190> workout<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:27.910> broke<00:01:28.149> my

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
where I ate before my workout I broke my

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.710 
where I ate before my workout I broke my
fast<00:01:28.630> before<00:01:29.110> my<00:01:29.289> workout<00:01:29.709> and<00:01:30.569> admittedly<00:01:31.569> I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
fast before my workout and admittedly I

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.710 
fast before my workout and admittedly I
did<00:01:32.229> feel<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.560> lot<00:01:32.860> better<00:01:33.039> I<00:01:33.429> was<00:01:34.090> under<00:01:34.599> the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
did feel a lot better I was under the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.570 
did feel a lot better I was under the
impression<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.500> wasn't<00:01:35.679> affecting<00:01:36.399> my

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
impression that it wasn't affecting my

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.990 
impression that it wasn't affecting my
training<00:01:37.119> but<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> definitely<00:01:38.020> was<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.399> will

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
training but it definitely was so I will

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.029 
training but it definitely was so I will
be<00:01:40.179> changing<00:01:40.720> that<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.110> upcoming<00:01:41.649> week<00:01:41.830> and

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
be changing that this upcoming week and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.870 
be changing that this upcoming week and
breaking<00:01:42.429> my<00:01:42.580> fast<00:01:42.940> before<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:44.610> workout<00:01:45.610> again

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
breaking my fast before I workout again

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.270 
breaking my fast before I workout again
and<00:01:46.390> see<00:01:46.630> how<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.959> goes<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.679> see<00:01:47.920> here

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
and see how that goes you can see here

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.029 
and see how that goes you can see here
where<00:01:49.209> my<00:01:49.360> hams<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.899> quads<00:01:49.990> tie<00:01:50.679> in<00:01:50.740> together

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
where my hams and quads tie in together

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.089 
where my hams and quads tie in together
I've<00:01:51.550> still<00:01:52.539> got<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.810> nice<00:01:53.259> cut<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:53.830> think

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099
