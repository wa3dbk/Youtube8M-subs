you know they admire him being French

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.979 
you know they admire him being French

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
most excited about with London 2012 I

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500 
most excited about with London 2012 I
think<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.769> me<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.940> advantages<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
think for me one of the advantages is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.900 
think for me one of the advantages is
it's<00:02:54.660> not<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.019> far<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.410> where<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> live<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
it's not so far from where I live so and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.339 
it's not so far from where I live so and
you<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.360> travel<00:02:57.569> for<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.840> horses<00:02:58.110> is

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
you know the travel for the horses is

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.089 
you know the travel for the horses is
very<00:02:58.940> very<00:02:59.940> easy<00:03:00.299> so<00:03:00.690> that's<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.079> big<00:03:01.709> benefit

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
very very easy so that's a big benefit

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.640 
very very easy so that's a big benefit
on<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.370> side<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.660> fact<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.140> guess<00:03:04.290> being

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
on that side and the fact I guess being

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.580 
on that side and the fact I guess being
in<00:03:04.769> London<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> think<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.150> probably

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
in London you know I think you probably

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.539 
in London you know I think you probably
probably<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.769> will<00:03:07.920> feel<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
probably I will feel that I have a

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.710 
probably I will feel that I have a
little<00:03:08.819> bit<00:03:08.970> more<00:03:09.090> support<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
little bit more support on the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.259 
little bit more support on the
Australian<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.849> I<00:03:12.060> think

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
Australian side there and I think

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.490 
Australian side there and I think
there'll<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> lot<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.750> Australians<00:03:13.200> over

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
there'll be a lot of Australians over

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.180 
there'll be a lot of Australians over
there<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:15.209> fact<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.569> matter<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.900> being<00:03:16.470> in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
there the fact of the matter is being in

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.850 
there the fact of the matter is being in
an<00:03:17.310> english-speaking<00:03:17.610> country<00:03:18.680> similar<00:03:19.680> to

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
of ups and downs and I had a lot of bad

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.439 
of ups and downs and I had a lot of bad
horses<00:04:48.009> when<00:04:48.520> i<00:04:48.550> was<00:04:48.699> here<00:04:48.789> in<00:04:48.850> australia<00:04:49.300> and

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
horses when i was here in australia and

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.570 
horses when i was here in australia and
i<00:04:49.509> had<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.690> lot<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.840> good<00:04:50.139> horses<00:04:50.860> as<00:04:51.160> well<00:04:51.190> but

i had a lot of good horses as well but

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.270 
i had a lot of good horses as well but
um<00:04:51.789> yeah<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.750> think<00:04:52.990> those<00:04:53.350> hard<00:04:53.620> times<00:04:53.830> got<00:04:54.130> me

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
um yeah I think those hard times got me

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.700 
um yeah I think those hard times got me
through<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.120> made<00:04:55.990> me<00:04:56.110> realize<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.500> little

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
through and and made me realize a little

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.640 
through and and made me realize a little
bit<00:04:56.919> where<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.759> and<00:04:58.350> what<00:04:59.350> kind<00:04:59.590> of

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
bit where I have to be and what kind of

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.200 
bit where I have to be and what kind of
horses<00:04:59.889> you<00:05:00.070> need<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.340> have<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:00.940> know<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
horses you need to have and you know the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.700 
horses you need to have and you know the
bad<00:05:01.389> horse<00:05:01.660> has<00:05:01.780> taught<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:01.990> bad<00:05:02.199> habits<00:05:02.560> but

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
bad horse has taught me bad habits but

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.710 
bad horse has taught me bad habits but
they<00:05:02.830> also<00:05:02.979> taught<00:05:03.280> me<00:05:03.460> some<00:05:03.669> good<00:05:04.240> habits<00:05:04.570> and

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
they also taught me some good habits and

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.300 
they also taught me some good habits and
gave<00:05:04.870> me<00:05:05.020> probably<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.349> lot<00:05:05.440> more<00:05:05.470> strength<00:05:06.070> and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
gave me probably a lot more strength and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.790 
gave me probably a lot more strength and
determination<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.599> think<00:05:08.199> probably<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.650> lot

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
determination and I think probably a lot

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.110 
determination and I think probably a lot
of<00:05:08.889> people<00:05:09.160> might<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.370> given<00:05:09.580> up<00:05:09.820> by<00:05:09.940> that

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
of people might have given up by that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.499 
of people might have given up by that
stage<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:12.580> proving<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.030> myself<00:05:13.180> that

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
stage and so just proving to myself that

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.659 
stage and so just proving to myself that
I<00:05:13.660> was<00:05:13.840> strong<00:05:14.080> enough<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.590> probably<00:05:15.370> gave<00:05:15.550> me

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
I was strong enough and probably gave me
