really far so we're going to go over
everything<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.630> left<00:00:18.930> out<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.410> list<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.310> blue

penny but blue blue colored marker so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.230 
penny but blue blue colored marker so
that<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> could<00:00:23.640> figure<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.180> doing

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that I could figure out what I'm doing

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529 
that I could figure out what I'm doing
today<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.460> inch<00:00:26.880> inner

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
today so this is a one inch inner

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.279 
today so this is a one inch inner
diameter<00:00:28.260> polycarbonate<00:00:29.099> tubing<00:00:29.460> yes<00:00:30.289> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
diameter polycarbonate tubing yes and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
diameter polycarbonate tubing yes and
then<00:00:31.470> over<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.769> top<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
then over the top here we have a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
then over the top here we have a
slightly<00:00:33.750> larger<00:00:33.960> size<00:00:34.320> polycarbonate

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
slightly larger size polycarbonate

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
slightly larger size polycarbonate
tubing<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
tubing it's kind of I don't know if I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
tubing it's kind of I don't know if I
can<00:00:36.329> tell<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.290> basically<00:00:37.530> makes

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
can tell that and that basically makes

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.260 
can tell that and that basically makes
it<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> screw<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it so that we can screw with that and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
it so that we can screw with that and
put<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> coupler<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.579> right<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.640> by

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
put the coupler right up right up by

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.369 
put the coupler right up right up by
next<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> plunger<00:00:42.510> head<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.050> no<00:00:43.200> dead

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
next the plunger head so there's no dead

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
next the plunger head so there's no dead
space<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> entirely<00:00:45.059> massive

let's<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> handle<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> end<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
let's make the handle on the end and the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
let's make the handle on the end and the
last<00:01:10.979> important<00:01:11.760> part<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> screws

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
last important part here is the screws

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
last important part here is the screws
in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.790> Danai<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
nylon fleets the aluminum plates those

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.179 
nylon fleets the aluminum plates those
also<00:01:17.880> reinforce<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.930> spring<00:01:19.680> rest<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
also reinforce the spring rest in the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
also reinforce the spring rest in the
back<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> spring<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> K<00:01:21.360> 26<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
back because the spring of K 26 it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
back because the spring of K 26 it's
very<00:01:22.380> powerful<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.580> keeps<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> gun

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
very powerful and that keeps the gun

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
very powerful and that keeps the gun
from<00:01:24.570> breaking<00:01:24.990> internally<00:01:25.500> blowing<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.400> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
from breaking internally blowing up so

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
right this thing is a beast it is a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.470 
right this thing is a beast it is a
beast<00:02:05.440> if<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.770> saw<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.980> power<00:02:06.480> basically

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
beast if you saw that power basically

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.570 
beast if you saw that power basically
the<00:02:07.840> last<00:02:08.050> thing<00:02:08.290> is<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.740> has<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> skirt<00:02:09.280> seal

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the last thing is it has a skirt seal

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.610 
the last thing is it has a skirt seal
which<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.240> an<00:02:10.479> improvement<00:02:10.570> over<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.080> 2<00:02:11.440> point

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
which is an improvement over the 2 point

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460 
which is an improvement over the 2 point
0<00:02:11.740> seal<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:12.640> had<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:12.970> other<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
0 seal that we had in the other one and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.830 
0 seal that we had in the other one and
that<00:02:15.130> makes<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.610> perfect<00:02:15.880> seal<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.630> gun

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
that makes for perfect seal on this gun

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.480 
that makes for perfect seal on this gun
we<00:02:17.020> kind<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.350> made<00:02:17.530> some<00:02:17.680> mistakes<00:02:18.100> along<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
we kind of made some mistakes along the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.100 
we kind of made some mistakes along the
way<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.390> seal<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:19.720> quite<00:02:19.960> perfect

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
way and so the seal is not quite perfect

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.570 
way and so the seal is not quite perfect
but<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.470> still<00:02:20.710> saw<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.310> straight
