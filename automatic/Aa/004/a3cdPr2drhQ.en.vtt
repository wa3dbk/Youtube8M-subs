 and there folks of the month the book offers dock 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 with samsung galaxy note 3001 o s4 4g 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.389
 I'm going to do a startup test 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.379
 android 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 I'm going to talk some or only complement 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 this video is made of the motorcycle 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.650
 bike is the way I already had a certain time 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 use and he lost in the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.599
 after I scored the goal and seven 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 factory of the two in moto gp finished 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.149
 winning bike is here and the s4 it can 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.579
 and you 'll definitely miss out on the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.219
 initialization because what I saw that the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 He is very fast in his 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.110
 boot I do not know that samsung did 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.309
 So I do not know if it's memory I 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.010
 I know what happened or if it's because the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.600
 phone is new it still does not have so many 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 apps do not have do not know if this goes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 influence I will not test you 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.370
 They can see that the devices they are 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 Off, ok, let's try here. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.689
 O 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:19.799
 the two here 123 biopav is pressing is 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:23.810
 that 123 has already joined it initializes a lot 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.810
 quick so I was so silly to see 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.070
 the union will already appear on the screen you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:43.840
 will see 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 hello ram 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ten seconds 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:53.590
 then s4 initialized so i said 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.330
 o'neill he's very fast people are me 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.970
 when the first time I called and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 I said ours is already started so it is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 really fast really 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.710
 Then maybe I'll take a test . 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.080
 factory here on this device we do 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.270
 a real test for the two to see who 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.000
 is that it boots faster but also 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 I will not show just that in the video that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.560
 another test I'll show other things 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.270
 also after personal touch so that's it 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.150
