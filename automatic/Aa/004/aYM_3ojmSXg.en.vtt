00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello then after so many but really 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.220
 lots of requests are here for 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.690
 make up your video tag what's in mine 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.210
 purse to redo you because I already have this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.850
 late and on my channel but it's a version 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 a little more a little less serious because 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.970
 precisely I had made that video with the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.470
 a video had been clear 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 improvised so we do just the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 idiots maybe I'll leave you the link here and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 so many of you have asked me to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 do it again after a year and then 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 in short, we could have done it again 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 this video in short to let you see a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 boss changed something then mine 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.649
 bag 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 currently this is where this one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.200
 wonderful with this cross I always say 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.200
 cross with this useless manner 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.219
 designed with all the studs and all 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.649
 I bought the Latin ones here at 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.920
 ferrara is not yours alone 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.590
 here I paid 29 euros and I do it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 immediately things are inside 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.100
 very heavy because most 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.799
 sometimes to my bags really 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 very heavy that can not be done 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.570
 but there are difficulties to carry around 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 really things that can be dispensed then 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 the first thing that is indispensable 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.970
 especially these days because it rains 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.490
 it is always the umbrella 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.890
 let's say when i see that out of the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.400
 time can hold I do n't take it though 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.479
 these days it is essential therefore a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 then the same umbrella for i 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.659
 gloves these are cream-colored 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.460
 nice cute obviously the wallet 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.100
 this is a portfolio I like 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.140
 very much because everything is in it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.299
 this one bought him at sea in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.840
 this summer I only paid 10 euros 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.469
 you see a stall like that 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.229
 and you really like it then as you will have 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.299
 understood I like these fantasies 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.850
 animals and as you will have understood from the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.840
 blanket behind and then the wallet 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 really indispensable is the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.239
 water bottle I never go out of 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.110
 home without the water bottle e 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:14.510
 invariably cisco without bottle 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.849
 I happen to die of proper thirst 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.660
 when the bottle then water 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.310
 natural always always behind absorbents 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.810
 scattered in the bag 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.420
 you must know that I am not at all 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.390
 in fact it is a mess as inside 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.989
 but it is always so therefore with respect to the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.360
 actually then we have hand cream 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:41.030
 this is of exex last year 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 in short, I finish the indispensable bonera 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.500
 obviously the trousse with inside i 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.709
 day-saving tricks let's say there 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.430
 they are inside little things like corrector 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.950
 mascara a blush a brush and then 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 maybe depending on how I'm wearing make-up 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.150
 so maybe the black pencil rather 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.190
 than the colored pencil rather than the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.760
 lipstick to revisit the makeup 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.480
 that or on that day then 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.590
 absolutely tricks saves save night 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.900
 will be the opportunity 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.620
 the only thing that maybe isn't spread around me 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.180
 in the pocket is the phone that I don't 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.130
 port but pocket a port never that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 I know it in my pants pocket 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.440
 I always carry it always in the bag or 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.010
 at most in hand if I need it 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.209
 if I really do n't know where to put it in my hand 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.880
 they are one of those that they are 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.040
 jacket pocket 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.400
 pants because he has a crazy fear 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.030
 chemistry ski at what point it breaks as 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.500
 you see a little fingerprints on the screen 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.840
 but ok then phone with mine 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 kalina canina covers that remain few 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.810
 Things attention on deodorant 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.450
 baby powder deodorant because if it happens to 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.310
 stay away all day 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.290
 maybe if I refresh myself then 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:05.440
 I also want to rightly have the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:07.240
 deodorant behind house key and also 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.040
 the keys never go out without a key 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.500
 because it happens that then I come home not 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.390
 there is no one nobody predicted me not 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.320
 absolutely shit me the keys 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.150
 in vado you learn if you don't hide behind and then 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.060
 just a few things are missing 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.400
 of handkerchiefs that then in winter are 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.880
 indispensable for candy candies 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.250
 halls I never go out and I never say never without 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.380
 candy especially in the morning 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.750
 when they go to school if by chance 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.810
 happens kind one twice a year e 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.710
 big by accident I leave home and I realize 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.280
 not to have the candy behind live 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.430
 a crisis just hysterical 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.740
 because anyway if I go out I can stop 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.170
 in a bar in a tobacco shop, buy me 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.510
 the cicles candies if I go to school but 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.640
 time to go to the bar square a 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.340
 buy candy so it comes to me 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.240
 just the axis because I maybe when 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.480
 you are when hungry to refresh a 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.540
 moment always always banishes the candies 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:16.000
 that's all they are without extra sugar 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:19.060
 strong that really save me not 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.920
 I know I am dependent on candy 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.050
 then the horses 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.430
 I must always have at least cv you are behind 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.820
 even when I go dancing that I don't 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.520
 I take the bag I put the package on 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.190
 stuck in the diseased bra and then there 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.590
 to the last thing a perfume also 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.590
 this saves the evening saves day saves 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.910
 anything because precisely 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.290
 in short, if you need to see someone if 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.690
 I don't know, but it happens to have to 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.540
 move this here is the bon bon of 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.310
 malice this is the melody in the case vi 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.520
 interested in this extra sweet 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.890
 they smell good and therefore nothing short of me 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.820
 I always carry deodorant and bon bon 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.450
 you never know 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.090
 now I would like you to point out the shit 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.130
 that is in my bag 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:17.350
 if I can show 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:20.750
 here it is , here are the various cards receipts 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.970
 bus tickets all scattered here 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.250
 inside 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.060
 this bag that gives you your own 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.530
 button 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.960
 I don't even ask myself the problem 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.500
 understand I am not at all ordered 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.630
 not at all good for me like this 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.300
 every now and then there is that shakes the 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.770
 bag but for the rest he concluded kakÃ  

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.080
 you never know and therefore nothing this was 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.950
 the tag update what's in mine 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.170
 bag are normal things in my opinion 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.580
 that everyone has in the bag 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.470
 who more or less who is more fixed with 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.450
 certain things than with others anyway 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.730
 I think there are more or less on the stock exchanges 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.560
 these things and so nothing I will now 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.810
 I send you a big kiss 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.920
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.920
 See you at the next hello
