 corruption and nothing happened now to what 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.079
 it's been what employment is a fashion 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.880
 very fast and so in less than two minutes

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.160
 we put commercially extreme line 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.800
 hard and stable aim that is the setup 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 that I just usually put in for 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.820
 take out the fastest at the beginning the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 game and nothing about the gameplay 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.170

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.700
 culture to my channel is the zp very 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.620
 interesting to show off 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.510
 It is worth it then you know conditioning 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.920
 end lace stable line hard and 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.689
 good discounts those that back in your 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.220
 channel apart from fast fashion is like 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.370

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.170
 in my channel is basically them out 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.840
 I opened because I wanted to teach people to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.480
 russia to russia with success i what i want 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.040
 look is for people to run and run 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.930
 so do not stay in a corner 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.730
 sitting looking for helicopters what 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.430
 I want to teach is that you can russia with 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.130
 success and that is possible for example 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.350
 we are a great example of that 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.870
 you can use run running and running 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.750
 be successful doing this for others 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.300
 things and without other things that you will see in the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.150
 channel are assemblies we like a lot to go to 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.930
 by clips and we like we would like to take 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.010
 a montage a month at least and if that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.510
 it's basically fashions montage and gameplays 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.310
 good in short and teach the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.900
 people to russia successfully that's what 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.430
 I want to teach and what I want from 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.770
 truth be in the channel is worth as 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.830
 through checking how much less fluency 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.320

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.460
 It contains looseness 2 because it has 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.410
 work of a fucking time 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 and if it's hard for me to talk fast 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.450
 imagine imagine him talking to a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.790
