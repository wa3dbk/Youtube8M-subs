00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.059
 With Google Analytics, you can collect and analyze data about mobile apps 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.029
 This is similar to the data collection and analysis of the website. 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.860
 However, the technology behind developing and running mobile apps 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.680
 Not the same technology as building a website 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.130
 So Google Analytics collects data from mobile apps in a different way. 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 We use JavaScript to collect data on our website. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.119
 For mobile apps, we use the SDK, the software development kit, to collect data. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.520
 Different operating systems have different SDKs, including Android and iOS SDKs. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 The SDK collects data about the app, such as what the user viewed. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.809
 The operating system of the device and the frequency at which the user launches the application 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.960
 This data will be packaged into a match and sent to your Google Analytics account. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.420
 This is similar to how JavaScript code sends matches from websites. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 Data from mobile apps is not immediately sent to Google Analytics 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.640
 When the user navigates through the app 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.530
 The Google Analytics SDK saves the match locally on the device 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.700
 Then send it to your Google Analytics account via a batch operation 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.349
 This operation is called "dispatch" 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.840
 There are two reasons why mobile data collection uses the "dispatch" method. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 First, the mobile device's network connection may be interrupted. 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.450
 If the device is not connected to the network 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.000
 SDK can't send any data match to Google Analytics 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.959
 Second, sending data to Google Analytics in real time may shorten your deviceâ€™s battery life. 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.819
 Therefore, the Android device's SDK will dispatch a match every 30 minutes. 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.379
 The iOS device's SDK is dispatched every 2 minutes. 

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.289
 But you can customize the time interval in your tracking code. 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.009
 Thereby controlling the impact on battery life 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.039
 Another important feature of the mobile SDK is to differentiate users. 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.899
 When the app is first launched 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.789
 The Google Analytics SDK generates a unique anonymous identifier for the device 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.840
 This is similar to how website tracking code works. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 Each unique identifier is also counted as a unique user in Google Analytics 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.469
 Even if the app is updated to an identifier on the new version of the device, it will not change. 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 However, if the app is uninstalled, the Google Analytics SDK will remove the identifier. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.499
 A new anonymous identifier will be created on the device when you reinstall this app in the future 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:45.349
 As a result, the user will be identified as a new user instead of a returning user. 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.549
 But any other data in your Google Analytics reports will not be affected. 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.920
 With the mobile SDK, we can use an easy way to track user activity in the app. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.599
 And collect most of the data you need without customizing 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.730
 But please note that there are many ways you can do it. 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.010
 To modify your code to collect information about users as well 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.499
 More information about the conversations and interactions users have with your app
