 public with many ads some of them 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.480

 through e mail service microsoft 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.120
 new system was announced in the year 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 passed but Microsoft had not yet 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 disclosed all the details about the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.129
 the company operates. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 expected to be in a billion 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 devices within two or three years 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.620
 one of the first related ads 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.420
 to the subject was that now the windows 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.730
 store will have its own service 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 thanks to a partnership with 90 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 mobile operators will not be 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.129
 more necessary a credit card in the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.870
 time to shop in the app store once 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 that there is the option to play the expenses 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.480
 with apps for your account 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.549
 telephone 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680
 now universal applications will allow 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.869
 the user to run windows 10 apps 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 on a pc and even after closing your 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.890
 desktop it can still choose to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 receive notifications and run web in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.619
 all your devices equipped with 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.619
 the latest version of the system 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 Another important novelty the incorporation 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.780
 of sp1 android apps codes 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.369
 Windows 10 had already rumors that the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 windows would allow some 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.360
 way android applications could be 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 executed on your platform the company 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 rumor has announced that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 developers can not only take their 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.799
 android application code for 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 windows 10 as well as 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.270
 even with them for me 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.670
 is now official the new browser of the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 microsoft before called only from 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 project spartan named microsoft 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.649
 edge 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 he came to replace the internet 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 explorer and if all goes right unlink 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 the name of Microsoft with the stigma of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.700
 bad browser 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.649
 the new browser has the option of writing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.340
 free through devices 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.200
 touch 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.209
 the user can type dial 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.370
 draw and scribble freely on the page 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.470
 and if you want to save the changes 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.130
 an image and share them by e-mail 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.690
 save the android gold the night keeping 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.280
 promise to make their services and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 universal devices 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.370
 microsoft also announced that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.870
 windows 10 by smartphones may be 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.070
 used in the same way as a computer 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.810
 complete 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.280
 This makes a lot of sense if we think about 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.930
 universal applications 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.120
 this way users can connect 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 mobile devices with the help of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.490
 a cable hdmi to see if the phone 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.490
 full screen 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.170
 many experts believe that the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.630
 next big industry revolution 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.830
 technology will be virtual reality and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.500
 it looks like microsoft is betting 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.670
 in spite of having already spoken a 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.950
 little about your glasses 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 holographic lenses and their 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.150
 windows platform or the company graphia 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.860
 took advantage of April 2015 to demonstrate 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 How is everything going to work? 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.090
 microsoft used the lens to take to the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.250
 stage of the event a physical robot that was 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.050
 superimposed by a graphic robot showing 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.580
 the possibilities offered by the gadget 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.930
 by platform 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.910
 we also discovered that the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 handkerchief is compatible with browsers if 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 It allows users to walk while 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.010
 resize the application screens and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.390
 interact with them through the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.800
 CG
