 others to the customer for minecraft only 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.199
 in my opinion it is much better because 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.180
 includes many many fads then plan 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.260

 I at zero because I have a hard file 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.040
 already downloaded after which we go to where 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.759

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.789
 bb da da percent and we will click in 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.159

 our ok now inside this one 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 folder we will click point minecraft 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.500
 on the minecraft point paper and then on 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 versione 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.659
 now I have already installed the lac here 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.680
 so I delete the list and client 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.049
 from the beginning 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.380
 so now let's take ours 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.550
 archive 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.300
 sip tu with the bike with the rubik mode 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.610
 on 1.6.2 and extract the folder that yes 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.990
 located entire memo of this 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.860
 this file just the folder 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.020
 rubik's and we drag precisely into the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.180
 version folder found funnel 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.260
 main stream is in eccentric roles 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.840
 and the center 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.920
 now we can close everything though 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 before closing I wanted to show you 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.940
 one thing now this time is so easy 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.740
 to install because in the end it is not a 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.130
 installer hetemaj because sail to be 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.350
 automatic ie I will let you download already 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 the profile already created as you see it coming 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.180
 then you just give him the move 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.470
 pure rubik's folder in the folder 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.820
 pour where all the profiles are 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.180
 then now let's open our launcher 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.190
 of minecraft I had to do another 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.420
 small step before starting it 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:44.380
 we are waiting for ours to open 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:50.270
 launcher let's go to the editor profiles 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.280
 we still expect it to load but ok 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.250
 editor profiles we talk about below is 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.690
 strong we call twice after 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.380
 we declare on news version 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.780
 we select relaxation rubik's that is precisely 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.160
 the profile we just created and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.410
 let's do six profiles 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.370
 then we leave here on profiles 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.990
 default and click on play off line 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.770
 now it will take some time because 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.650
 will have to install the mood of 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.730
 all the profile ok to made me right away 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.250
 immediately maybe you will put us a little more than 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.530
 I don't know how long it also depends on 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.910
 your connection will be faster 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.280
 your connection less time there 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.350
 will take our game ok 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.460
 so watch this launcher here 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.050
 ok 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.000
 as you see the minecraft screen 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.110
 it's not the same but it's very different 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.540
 reality nt under photos with different colors 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.370
 here if you want you can get back the money i 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.200
 I have any players for this bike 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.310
 detail toorop exclusion does very little 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.210
 it's up to you to give up a little bit 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.740
 he did this bike but he must apologize for 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.680
 the problem unfortunately is dependent on 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.130
 comments both my computer and a little 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.460
 ram and then the race a little bit a 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.230
 little good, then first thing 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.600
 you notice after installing this 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.160
 night and in the upper left there is 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.770
 just the party in africa if finally 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.070
 call less full of pages and pages 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.500
 we can scroll by clicking the buttons 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.500
 the arrows precisely the directional keys 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.260
 ok then now i also here in this 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.370
 me lucio listed there are listed 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.780
 precisely the mode earth has gone so 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.240
 there is a little key that little key serves to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.130
 activate the moore would have described fly 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.550
 coffee water fly wrote and for now 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.860
 only the key f as you see the 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.980
 written fly becomes green becomes green 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.120
 and I see how I can fly then 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:57.190
 I have just installed many then just 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.810
 using the flai bike I died for 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.350
 turn off this time the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.610
 father again f of those who believe that 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.050
 disappear 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.720
 we click hicks for example that there 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.540
 comes a x3 mode that I call dino zoe 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.490
 x and disable it click on laps e 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.630
 we have speed mode and we can run 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.850
 fast and then to hide the menu 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.530
 how did I do it and now just load the 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.340
 his arrow keys the dart that 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:28.150
 goes upwards towards north and a 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.010
 ok cross and as you can see you are sorry 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.380
 the patches run and there were four 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.990
 pages including three are full of many 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.660
 one and last there was the compass 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.460
 the fps the coordinates for which we as 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.030
 see my computer at fps 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.670
 just stop at 8 fps then 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.920
 imagine you the udc ok 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.500
 I hope this tutorial has been there 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.790
 useful it was useful to sign up for 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.000
 other English league tutorials 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.680
