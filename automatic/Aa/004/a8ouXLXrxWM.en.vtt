00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.740
 also disappointing about the game 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.870
 course 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.299
 they actually have nothing to worry about 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.590
 all checking the first half 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.180
 actually two moments from it 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.800
 inattention 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 cross the lander chance is that know it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.410
 takes natural risk to get that ball in 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 to take hands 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.490
 what is the moment there and then 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.940
 then big-o out of the blue a long one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 horse that should not happen of course 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.920
 the for we had already been and extend 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 nice side with viktor fischer and we 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 had control and that just 0 0 the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.699
 resignation and ultimately 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 will then go more risks 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.510
 and I take our own options 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.160
 and finally we also have ours 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 had possibilities and it was one of them 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.720
 enters a naturally exists very 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 otherwise here and then you get too 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.989
 such a Sunday shot that fails 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.710
 yes we still have to do it and you go t 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.820
 just go with confidence 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 seemed long for then go to moment 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 from a lot and he wouldn't be a man yet 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.800
 actually makes a goal overboard at home 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.570
 better there than played ' 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.420
 is just our profile minute and 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.800
 and the second the second come off the species 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.780
 for them the intersection 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.790
 you give it pretty well to their defenses 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.659
 percent of opportunities do not really live away 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.100
 you know out 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.960
 said that kind of moments get two or 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 three in the competition that unfolds Ebola 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 and the they can shoot and if you like that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.560
 does not do better than you know it is possible 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.450
 and so yes details of the dress and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.729
 before making little and it works by 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.119
 two unwary have come on 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.130
 pay attention to today it is the timer 2 0 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.619
 become what may not be at this level and 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.890
 it even becomes against being stereo 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.690
 the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.450
 mercilessly punished I know this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.420
 was natural and lovely when from 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.460
 someone and then you know your child we 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.770
 extend and maybe up and it is and 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 we still have the extension 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.369
 we just saw we were broken 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.250
 done everything but we clothes too little 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.290
 today and make it out on the job 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.209
 to think 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.590
 So think of this acquaintance tell me on 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.150
 not yet a list for the press conference 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.739
 the penalty takers 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.910
 one did you make that list did you 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.170
 that from there in suez you got it 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.769
 already a bit with players yesterday 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.840
 talked about 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.870
 soeke players you are going to end 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.750
 but I actually already had 4 very quickly 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.709
 people we actually we stand after a 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 fact added 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.290
 for doubt the young see or doubt 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.290
 Lasse SchÃ¶ne who have already missed 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.269
 Get a penalty in one that are used to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.190
 to take the english I think just with 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.070
 you have to be the right one in that penalty series 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.730
 take responsibility and put pressure 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:54.459
 on but not anymore and that just naja 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.019
 poorly enclosed and no apologies 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.450
 just my 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 responsibilities and I wanted to 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.350
 take another one but sit down 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.760
 aromatic 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.500
 the last 5 penalties blog went there 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.500
 You didn't go in with a lot of confidence 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.290
 This penalty shoot your course jimmy 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.389
 you know it is a lottery where the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.290
 not much information from them but true 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.449
 convincing photos in the we want by 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.639
 the following would follow with shells 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:25.389
 and those are the competitions 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.480
 that you want to play and this is this 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.300
 does the what with of course 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.430
 but i have to say he was just 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.340
 have a good team today 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.840
 spelled correctly , two more are needed there 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.940
 fronts 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.519
 indeed the most important pound 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.590
 of course the competition and clear 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.209
 will all be on 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.099
 And of course we want to be two 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.280
 steps depend on a price and that 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.709
 we also want to try in the cup 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.299
 and the first is what I just got 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.799
 said is the most important and that is still 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.420
 but the question 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.159
 happy spelling went there and there 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.430
 children is important to this 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.660
 drunk when your audience dislikes full 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.760
 arena 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.760
 then you start stepping in with dairy
