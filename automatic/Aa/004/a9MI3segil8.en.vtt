00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 It was only when you were well with me. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 everything great and today the video will be about 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.830
 natural hair relaxation you 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.960
 You may be making a home 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'll just have to remember that like this one. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 is a natural treatment it will not have 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 a permanent effect on your hair 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 it will only appear on your hair when 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 you do not make a recipe this year than 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.490
 your hair looks beautiful, what will not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.890
 okay it will only give a scare in bunches 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.530
 it will only open a little sparse 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 This is the result of today's video. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.840
 video dedicated to girls who still 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.969
 are discovering their clusters 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 discovering how to care for them that still 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 they can not keep that volume 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.090
 all in the hair without feeling safe I 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.100
 I get many questions like what you do 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 to have less volume in my hair 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 I particularly love my hair full 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 of volume those beautiful curls and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.810
 wonderful but on girls who still 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.409
 are getting used to it and from the new to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.350
 she 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.340
 so I made this video for you and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340
 I hope you like it. 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.180
 You will need coconut milk and a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.250
 juice and a lemon people again lemon okay 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.200
 Be very careful how I'm going to do it. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.030
 to leave not only do we already know the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.479
 story that the brother spots for those who do not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.250
 knows coconut milk already low enough 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.160
 the volume of your hair 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.920
 only with the lemon juice adding the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 lemon juice this effect will be very 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.070
 The stronger you are then you'll get a 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.050
 amount of coconut milk and added 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 the juice of 1 lemon 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.040
 I used a little brother tannhauser 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.470
 because he would not stay 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.759
 very watery and that makes it difficult 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.960
 time to apply make a lot of mess 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.960
 you know 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.519
 after you mix the two you 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.629
 let in the refrigerator for about 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.629
 2 more hours 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.120
 You need to be with your hair damp. 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.700
 and cleared in time for you 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.909
 stay you do a lot but act in that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.129
 where you think the volume of your 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.709
 Hair bothers you, you do 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:49.609
 a gentle massage your hair to 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.989
 that the hair absorbs the product is applied 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:56.569
 throughout the hair doing massage and 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.389
 time you just applied if you 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.819
 want a very visible result in your 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.790
 Hair you can put on the warm cap 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.430
 For about an hour or so I did 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.560
 this treatment just because I love you 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.260
 is because people I do not like 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.379
 hair, short hair 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.560
 instead of leaving one hour I left 15 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.540
 just minutes to make a hydration 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 even my hair because of any 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.849
 form this is a hydration 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.090
 Well then in my hair, you're not going to 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.359
 I can see so much result because I 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.129
 I left 15 minutes ago but if you 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.680
 I want a very cool result, I left 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.169
 for an hour an hour and a half to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.290
 that you really feel that it has opened 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.790
 I'll give you some sugar. 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.189
 Two days ago 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.189
 and this is still the result 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.680
 the girls who asked me if brother 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.720
 let the hair dry people lemon not 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.470
 dries your hair you can not either 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.870
 use it so consecutively if you 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.569
 make a recipe with lemon today 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.510
 next recipe that you will use that 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.900
 It's handy next week, it's fine. 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.660
 so do not get used very regularly 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.810
 because then you will receive more car 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.120
 using once a week is mixed 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.430
 with some natural recipe in my hair 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.780
 it does not dry out; 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.210
 hydration of the skin 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.270
 I'm going to make a video for you guys like that. 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.080
 moisturize my hair using only lemon 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.360
 fine 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.979
 without removing the hair there is nothing I think 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.740
 You'll like it, it 's a recipe. 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.410
 simple and easy I'll teach you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.070
 You guys in the next video for this video. 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.630
 It's not too long, I'm fine. 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.660
 using sodium bicarbonate 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.970
 but if you still can not take it 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.479
 using baking soda or lemon 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.120
 You use a very light kick and preference. 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.550
 those who are released are attentive 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.550
 facts neither strong nor light to good 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.100
 because if you use a very strong shampoo 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.800
 and it turns out that the effect of the treatment goes 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.140
 get out of your hair and then people are time 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.039
 lost and so when you take your 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.960
 hair 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.850
 you feel that hair so soft so 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.010
 It's nice touch, fine touch, it's beautiful, it's good I 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.900
 I hope you like this recipe. 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.120
 I hope you guys do 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.070
 and if you do not forget me 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.830
 tell you later because you have a history 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.930
 start with the kitties 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.860

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.750
