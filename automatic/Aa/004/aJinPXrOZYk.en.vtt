00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and of course we did basically we see

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.370 
and of course we did basically we see
that<00:02:23.130> everyone<00:02:23.610> who<00:02:23.760> makes<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.090> TV<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.599> makes

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
that everyone who makes a TV now makes

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.410 
that everyone who makes a TV now makes
some<00:02:25.709> 4k<00:02:26.130> TVs<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:26.819> they're<00:02:27.000> everywhere

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
4k panels in the description below some

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.759

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
of the TVs and monitors I've gotten

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.050 
of the TVs and monitors I've gotten
hands-on<00:02:35.069> time<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.910> actually

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
hands-on time with that I can actually

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.120 
hands-on time with that I can actually
recommend<00:02:36.630> including<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.349> ACE<00:02:37.470> uses<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.920> use

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
recommend including the ACE uses I use

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.759 
recommend including the ACE uses I use
now<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.150> clearly<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.110> getting<00:02:40.349> easier<00:02:40.650> to

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
now so clearly it's getting easier to

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.089 
now so clearly it's getting easier to
watch<00:02:41.010> 4k<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.840> what<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.290> watch<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.769> 4k
