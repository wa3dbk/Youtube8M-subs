now that you have your board out of the
mold<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.979> start<00:00:35.190> guarding<00:00:35.789> the<00:00:35.850> shape<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
mold you can start guarding the shape so

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.329 
mold you can start guarding the shape so
take<00:00:36.929> that<00:00:36.960> tech<00:00:37.319> deck<00:00:37.530> they<00:00:38.519> have<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> put<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
take that tech deck they have and put it

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.639 
take that tech deck they have and put it
directly<00:00:41.339> on<00:00:41.609> top<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.999> the<00:00:42.059> mold<00:00:42.649> evenly

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
directly on top of the mold evenly

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.219 
directly on top of the mold evenly
distributed<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.139> time<00:00:46.319> to<00:00:46.469> drive

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
set it and start drawing just trace

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.059 
set it and start drawing just trace
along<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.809> edge<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> tech<00:00:58.559> deck<00:01:01.069> make

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
along the edge of the tech deck make

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.439 
along the edge of the tech deck make
sure<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.249> keep<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.459> tech<00:01:02.729> deck<00:01:02.909> steady<00:01:03.209> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
sure to keep the tech deck steady and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.170 
sure to keep the tech deck steady and
don't<00:01:04.049> break<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:04.379> lid<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> after<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.399> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
don't break your lid so after that it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
don't break your lid so after that it
should<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.539> like<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.799> your

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
should look like that now they get your

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.279 
should look like that now they get your
shape<00:01:14.130> drawn<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.689> start<00:01:15.990> cutting

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
shape drawn out you can start cutting

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.529 
shape drawn out you can start cutting
the<00:01:16.409> ages<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> making<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.789> easier<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.270> sand

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
the ages and making it easier to sand

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.450 
the ages and making it easier to sand
orange<00:01:19.200> scissors<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.039> edges

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
orange scissors so just go on the edges

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
orange scissors so just go on the edges
with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> scissors<00:01:24.380> cutting<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with the scissors cutting around the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.849 
with the scissors cutting around the
shape<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.159> it'll<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.369> easier<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.789> stand<00:01:27.679> if<00:01:28.679> you

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
shape so it'll be easier to stand if you

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.789 
shape so it'll be easier to stand if you
have<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> disc<00:01:29.340> sander<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> belt<00:01:30.840> sander<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
have a disc sander or a belt sander this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.109 
have a disc sander or a belt sander this
would<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.070> easier<00:01:32.219> you<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.880> run

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
would be a lot easier you could just run

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.440 
would be a lot easier you could just run
it<00:01:33.240> against<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.320> don't<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.249> that<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it against that but I don't have that so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
it against that but I don't have that so
this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.289> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.499> have<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.679> do<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.979> right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this is going to have to do for right

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.200 
this is going to have to do for right
now

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.420 

okay<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.479> take<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.870> sandpaper<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.100> just

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
okay so now take your sandpaper and just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.340 
okay so now take your sandpaper and just
sand<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.940> edges<00:01:51.080> all<00:01:52.080> around<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.940> flush

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
sand the edges all around so it's flush

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.760 
sand the edges all around so it's flush
with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.450> lines<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.659> drew<00:01:57.869> earlier<00:02:00.619> okay<00:02:01.619> now
