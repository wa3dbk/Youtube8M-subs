having several machines in one what did

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
having several machines in one what did
you<00:01:23.130> mean<00:01:23.280> by<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> use<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you mean by that well you can use this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.440 
you mean by that well you can use this
machine<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> single<00:01:26.220> stage<00:01:26.490> light<00:01:26.939> polisher

machine as a single stage light polisher

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
machine as a single stage light polisher
by<00:01:27.600> simply<00:01:27.990> running<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.500> disc<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> final

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
by simply running the disc on the final

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.550 
by simply running the disc on the final
polishing<00:01:30.090> head<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.630> minute<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
polishing head for one minute or use a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
polishing head for one minute or use a
couple<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> stages<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.880> lightly<00:01:33.180> scratched

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
couple of stages for lightly scratched

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.679 
couple of stages for lightly scratched
discs<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.880> could<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> machine<00:01:36.659> for

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
discs so you could use the machine for

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
discs so you could use the machine for
fast<00:01:36.990> preventative<00:01:37.619> maintenance<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.729> what

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
fast preventative maintenance but what

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.700

for<00:01:57.840> something<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.619> bad<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.460> would<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.790> all

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
for something that bad we would use all

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.380 
for something that bad we would use all
six<00:02:00.509> stages<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.829> minute<00:02:02.009> apiece<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:03.149> bring

stages<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:30.349> I<00:03:30.379> simply<00:03:30.769> use<00:03:30.920> one<00:03:31.190> step<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.700> let

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
stages can I simply use one step and let

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.600 
stages can I simply use one step and let
it<00:03:31.940> run<00:03:32.090> longer<00:03:32.560> remember<00:03:33.560> not<00:03:33.890> every<00:03:34.280> scratch

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
it run longer remember not every scratch
