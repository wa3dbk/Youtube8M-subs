 nicest side 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.450
 the was shaken yes well we even the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.240
 broadcaster flevoland called the next day 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.620
 that the amusement park was overcrowded and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.510
 riots arose 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.710
 well we called walibi and once 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.990
 asked why it is so out of control 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.700
 Yes we regret this is that 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.440
 we have had so many people 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.870
 disappoint but we have one 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.590
 permit for 20,000 and the we keep 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.990
 us 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.240
 so the park is in danger of becoming overcrowded 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.400
 we have social media at four 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.260
