00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
what I did on this I might do a tutorial

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.110 
what I did on this I might do a tutorial
on<00:03:18.890> how<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.070> do<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.900> uh<00:03:20.930> yeah<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.520> that's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
on how to do that but uh yeah so that's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.720 
on how to do that but uh yeah so that's
basically<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.900> for<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.709> custom<00:03:25.100> texture<00:03:25.640> of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
basically it for the custom texture of

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.000 
basically it for the custom texture of
fact<00:03:25.940> let<00:03:26.060> me<00:03:26.090> show<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.600> particles

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.770 

particles<00:03:31.010> are<00:03:31.489> nothing<00:03:31.880> special

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.070 

so<00:03:37.700> actually<00:03:38.700> they<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:38.850> need<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.750> here's

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so actually they don't need to so here's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.800

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
down and hit them you can see the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.730 
down and hit them you can see the
sharpness<00:03:49.920> particles<00:03:50.460> are<00:03:50.700> tiny<00:03:51.030> diamonds

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
sharpness particles are tiny diamonds

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.550
