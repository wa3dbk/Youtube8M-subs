00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
as I said in this video we can fall a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.400 
as I said in this video we can fall a
single<00:00:02.970> piece<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.149> paper<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.659> have<00:00:03.870> more<00:00:04.259> than

a<00:00:46.260> hundred<00:00:47.160> three<00:00:47.730> folds<00:00:48.360> yeah<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.350> was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
a hundred three folds yeah I was

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
a hundred three folds yeah I was
surprised<00:00:49.950> too<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.879> talking

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
surprised too but we are not talking

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
surprised too but we are not talking
about<00:00:51.480> linear<00:00:52.020> growth<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.829> two<00:00:52.980> three

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
about linear growth here one two three

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
about linear growth here one two three
four<00:00:53.309> five<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.059> talking<00:00:54.539> about

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
four five we are talking about

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
four five we are talking about
exponential<00:00:55.530> growth<00:00:55.980> another<00:00:56.699> example<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
exponential growth another example is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
exponential growth another example is
even<00:00:57.899> better<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.010> story<00:00:59.340> goes<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.640> thousand

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
even better as the story goes a thousand

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
even better as the story goes a thousand
years<00:01:00.480> ago<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> mathematician<00:01:01.170> named<00:01:01.800> Sesa

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
years ago a mathematician named Sesa

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
years ago a mathematician named Sesa
invented<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> chess<00:01:03.780> after<00:01:04.470> showing

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
invented the game of chess after showing

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
invented the game of chess after showing
the<00:01:04.830> game<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> king<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.390> pleased

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the game to the king he was so pleased

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
the game to the king he was so pleased
that<00:01:06.900> he<00:01:07.020> gave<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> invented<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that he gave the invented the right to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 
that he gave the invented the right to

name his price Sassa being very cunning

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
name his price Sassa being very cunning
asked<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> King<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> first

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
asked the King this then for the first

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.080 
asked the King this then for the first
square<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> chessboard<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.939> would

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
square of the chessboard he would

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
square of the chessboard he would
receive<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.720> grain<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> -<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> second

doubling<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> amount<00:01:20.640> each<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.380> surprised

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
doubling the amount each time surprised

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.740 
doubling the amount each time surprised
by<00:01:22.770> its<00:01:22.950> essence<00:01:23.400> modesty<00:01:23.850> King<00:01:24.150> said<00:01:24.450> yes

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
by its essence modesty King said yes

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.190 
by its essence modesty King said yes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
is so huge that I can't even imagine it

then all of them all of them would weigh

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.980 
then all of them all of them would weigh
500<00:01:59.790> billion<00:02:00.450> tons

if average size of each grain is four

millimeters then putting them

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
millimeters then putting them
side-by-side<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.080> us<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.560> Alpha

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
side-by-side would take us to the Alpha

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.590 
side-by-side would take us to the Alpha
Centauri<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.759> back<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.860> than<00:02:11.070> eight

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
Centauri and back that's more than eight

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600

light-years<00:02:13.160> exponential<00:02:14.160> growth<00:02:14.340> is

light-years exponential growth is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.030 
light-years exponential growth is
everywhere<00:02:15.209> around<00:02:15.360> us<00:02:15.780> yet<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.680> hard

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
everywhere around us yet it's so hard

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.340 
everywhere around us yet it's so hard
for<00:02:17.310> us<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.640> understand<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.140> so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
for us to understand because it's so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.760 
for us to understand because it's so
