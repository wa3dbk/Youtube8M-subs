just a moment here we're looking at the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.669 
just a moment here we're looking at the
factory<00:00:27.689> original<00:00:28.050> Toyota<00:00:29.039> Corolla<00:00:29.550> hubcap

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
factory original Toyota Corolla hubcap

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.340 
factory original Toyota Corolla hubcap
however<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.579> hubcap<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.930> sure<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.320> know

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
however this hubcap as I'm sure you know

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
however this hubcap as I'm sure you know
falls<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:35.510> way<00:00:36.510> too<00:00:36.570> often<00:00:37.579> unfortunately<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
falls off way too often unfortunately it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.200 
falls off way too often unfortunately it
was<00:00:39.600> designed<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.739> poorly<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
was designed very poorly from the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.350 
was designed very poorly from the
manufacturers<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:44.129> why<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:44.879> hubcaps

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
manufacturers that's why here at hubcaps

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.360 
manufacturers that's why here at hubcaps
calm<00:00:45.930> we've<00:00:46.680> designed<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.700> factory<00:00:48.420> replica

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
calm we've designed this factory replica

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.260 
calm we've designed this factory replica
hubcap<00:00:50.719> this<00:00:51.719> hubcap<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.500> made<00:00:52.920> way<00:00:53.579> stronger

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
hubcap this hubcap is made way stronger

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.500 
hubcap this hubcap is made way stronger
more<00:00:54.930> durable<00:00:55.289> than<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> factory<00:00:56.820> original

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
more durable than this factory original

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.979 
more durable than this factory original
one<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:58.160> now<00:00:59.160> let's<00:00:59.699> take<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> close<00:01:00.329> look<00:01:00.510> at

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
one was now let's take a close look at

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.039 
one was now let's take a close look at
this<00:01:01.199> factory<00:01:01.739> original<00:01:02.039> Corolla<00:01:02.640> hubcap<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this factory original Corolla hubcap so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
this factory original Corolla hubcap so
we<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> better<00:01:04.559> understanding<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> why

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
we get a better understanding as to why

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.320 
we get a better understanding as to why
it<00:01:06.270> keeps<00:01:06.659> flying<00:01:07.110> off<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.470> vehicle<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.460> we

are bound to break off and unfortunately

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420 
are bound to break off and unfortunately
once<00:01:47.939> they've<00:01:48.180> broken<00:01:48.509> off<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:49.619> hubcap<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
just going to keep flying right off
that's<00:01:53.340> why<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.360> hubcaps<00:01:54.930> we've

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that's why here at hubcaps we've

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.060 
that's why here at hubcaps we've
designed<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.520> durable<00:01:57.240> strong<00:01:58.020> replica<00:01:58.860> as

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
designed this durable strong replica as

designed this durable strong replica as
you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.630> looks<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.110> lot<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you can see it looks a lot like from the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
you can see it looks a lot like from the
factory<00:02:03.270> original<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.320> only<00:02:04.649> difference<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
factory original the only difference is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.330 
factory original the only difference is
this<00:02:06.030> hubcap<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.899> doesn't<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.950> Toyota

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
