00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.519
 better a stove a long time ago 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.519
 check the shoes 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.949
 today we are going to restore a 1922 stove 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.260
 what we are seeing here is that they have 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.289
 much damage the whole part of inside has 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.350
 all the sheet food the gas system 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.910
 nothing works the keys do not work 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.199
 it does not work, it does not work 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.879
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.159
 in fact , we are going to have to change 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.929
 completely how many days are we going to 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.059
 will be less than 2010 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.859
 we are convent and he is placing the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.170
 paste to straighten one of the parts 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.999
 most important of this stove this is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 something of what will be one of the doors 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.949
 of the stove is a long time in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.479
 the whole welder is making the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.160
 new burners because when the 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.440
 stove arrived they did not have them 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.480
 the work we have is one of the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.700
 more complicated stoves that we have had 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.700
 and I think that if an increase is necessary 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 one day for delivery and the other 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.070
 worker fernando never arrived so 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.259
 in that moment to help him I 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.000
 I have to place the background for this 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.000
 big stove 20s 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.220
 instead of laughing so help him 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.220
 football for attention 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.430
 did 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.770
 it was a lot of work we left the structure 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.140
 original we change the drawers we change 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.030
 the views and we make again the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.190
 burners and we put the needs 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.950
 new 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.840
 we restored an object and made it sprout 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.420
 the feelings in the kicks I am 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.670
 a grouper and he is watching the show and his new 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.660
 stove restored in the 20s and these 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.660
 were the kicks
