they got to keep them in that pocket if
he<00:02:02.310> starts<00:02:02.549> getting<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.840> going

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
he starts getting out there it's going

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.300 
he starts getting out there it's going
to<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> long<00:02:04.320> day<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.770> defense<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
to be a long day for the defense so I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
to be a long day for the defense so I
think<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.820> number<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.299> key<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.899> D<00:02:07.170> line

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
think the number one key is this D line

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
think the number one key is this D line
and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.160> course<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.520> often<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.910> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and then of course it often is just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.089 
and then of course it often is just
making<00:02:09.360> sure<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.050> vary<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
making sure they can vary it up the I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.640 
making sure they can vary it up the I
mean<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.550> played<00:02:11.819> 31<00:02:12.330> plays

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
mean they played 31 plays

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
mean they played 31 plays
of<00:02:13.709> running<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.549> 31<00:02:15.060> players<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.599> passing<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
of running and 31 players of passing and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.199 
of running and 31 players of passing and
Syracuse<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.549> they<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:17.970> keep<00:02:18.150> that

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
Syracuse so if they can keep that

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.509 
Syracuse so if they can keep that
varying<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.140> think<00:02:19.680> floors<00:02:19.890> take<00:02:20.099> away<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
varying up I think floors take away a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.940 
varying up I think floors take away a
victory<00:02:20.849> for<00:02:21.480> me<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.810> turnovers<00:02:22.379> both<00:02:22.680> teams

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
victory for me is turnovers both teams

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.500 
victory for me is turnovers both teams
