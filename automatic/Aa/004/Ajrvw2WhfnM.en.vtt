so and what is about view this time
little<00:01:50.000> robot<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.580> with<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.759> two

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
little robot I'm here and with this two

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
little robot I'm here and with this two
buttons<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.420> control<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.110> character

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
buttons you can control the character

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.539 
buttons you can control the character
left<00:01:55.580> right<00:01:56.409> here<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.560> can<00:01:57.740> jump<00:01:59.140> so<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:01.340> see

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
left right here you can jump so to see

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.440 
left right here you can jump so to see
when<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.880> jump<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.289> gravity's<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:05.299> on

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
when you jump it's the gravity's like on

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.469 
when you jump it's the gravity's like on
the<00:02:05.570> moon<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.670> here<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.820> can<00:02:08.030> change<00:02:08.239> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the moon and here you can change the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.660 
the moon and here you can change the
gravity<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.470> we<00:02:09.739> don't<00:02:09.979> need<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.550> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
gravity but we don't need this in the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.220 
gravity but we don't need this in the
stage<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.930> goal<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.800> every<00:02:13.280> stage<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
stage the goal is in every stage to to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.890 
stage the goal is in every stage to to
reach<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.830> door<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.489> see<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> storm<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.870> a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
reach this door you see the storm we a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.759 
reach this door you see the storm we a
sequence<00:02:18.769> of<00:02:18.890> Advocates<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.410> then<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.560> switch

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
sequence of Advocates so then you switch

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.229 
sequence of Advocates so then you switch
this<00:02:21.950> button<00:02:22.340> that's<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.600> can<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.989> here

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
this button that's all you can do here

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.759 
this button that's all you can do here
so<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.750> next<00:02:26.900> stage<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
so that's the next stage so here is the

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.170 
so that's the next stage so here is the
goal<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.750> how<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.049> we<00:02:33.470> reach<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.090> here's<00:02:35.090> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
goal so how can we reach this here's a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.140 
goal so how can we reach this here's a
little<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> tutorial<00:02:36.519> so<00:02:37.519> what<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.120> is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
little bit a tutorial so what we do is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.530 
little bit a tutorial so what we do is
we<00:02:38.989> switch<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.650> screen<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.310> change<00:02:41.269> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
we switch the screen and change the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.810 
we switch the screen and change the
gravity<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.290> now<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.100> control<00:02:43.489> schemes

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
gravity and now on the control schemes

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.050 
gravity and now on the control schemes
goes<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:44.870> goes<00:02:45.350> down<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.519> bottom<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
goes up goes down to the bottom of the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.170 
goes up goes down to the bottom of the
screen<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.620> walk<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:50.000> is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
screen and you can walk here this is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.120 
screen and you can walk here this is
pretty<00:02:50.480> cool<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.900> yet<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.620> pretty<00:02:52.040> cool

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
pretty cool as yet this is pretty cool

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.110 
pretty cool as yet this is pretty cool
so<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.269> we<00:02:54.109> reach<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.470> dock<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:58.060> now<00:02:59.060> we

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
so and we reach the dock so now we

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.750 
so and we reach the dock so now we
switch<00:02:59.299> back<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.910> here's<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.019> goal<00:03:03.549> yeah<00:03:04.549> are

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
switch back so here's the goal yeah are

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.170 
switch back so here's the goal yeah are
we<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.450> let<00:03:05.810> us<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.109> jump<00:03:09.350> over

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
we so let us do this we can jump over

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.550 
we so let us do this we can jump over
but<00:03:11.180> here<00:03:11.600> oh<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:13.220> pay<00:03:13.670> oh<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.150> failed<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:18.320> see

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
but here oh I pay oh I failed so you see

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.789 
but here oh I pay oh I failed so you see
this<00:03:18.799> this<00:03:19.100> gap<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:20.049> small<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.320> this<00:03:21.530> gap<00:03:21.769> is

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
this this gap is small and this gap is

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.849 
this this gap is small and this gap is
too<00:03:21.890> big<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.519> jump<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.239> what<00:03:23.570> we<00:03:23.720> do<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:23.900> we

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
too big for a jump so what we do is we

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.460 
too big for a jump so what we do is we
rotate<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.459> screen<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:26.390> change<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.019> gravity

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
rotate the screen we change the gravity

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.849 
rotate the screen we change the gravity
and<00:03:27.880> then<00:03:28.880> we<00:03:29.090> go<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.660> left<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.709> left

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
and then we go to the left to the left

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.540 
and then we go to the left to the left
to<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.370> left<00:03:31.430> so

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.320 

this<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.180> then<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.820> change<00:03:37.880> the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
this and then we do this and change the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.930 
this and then we do this and change the
gravity<00:03:38.750> again<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.920> then<00:03:40.490> we're<00:03:40.670> going<00:03:40.850> to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
gravity again and then we're going to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.080 
gravity again and then we're going to
walk<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.450> right<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.930> go<00:03:42.350> sleep<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> off<00:03:43.090> so

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
walk to the right and go sleep it off so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.200 
walk to the right and go sleep it off so
here<00:03:44.420> are<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.960> disculpa<00:03:45.830> oh<00:03:46.130> yeah<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.030> you

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
here are this disculpa oh yeah and you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.890 
here are this disculpa oh yeah and you
have<00:03:47.980> concluded<00:03:48.980> this<00:03:49.220> oh<00:03:49.580> how<00:03:50.330> we<00:03:50.390> can<00:03:50.720> do

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
have concluded this oh how we can do

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.680 
have concluded this oh how we can do
this<00:03:51.400> change<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.490> gravity<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:54.400> okay<00:03:55.690> it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
this change to gravity what okay it's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this change to gravity what okay it's
not<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.110> right<00:03:57.260> way<00:03:58.270> so<00:03:59.270> technically<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.080> think

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
not the right way so technically I think

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.560 
not the right way so technically I think
it<00:04:00.800> looked<00:04:00.980> pretty<00:04:01.250> pretty<00:04:01.940> good<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.360> game

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
it looked pretty pretty good the game

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.740 
it looked pretty pretty good the game
the<00:04:03.080> graphics<00:04:03.320> are<00:04:04.240> standard<00:04:05.240> nothing

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
the graphics are standard nothing

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.530 
the graphics are standard nothing
special<00:04:06.080> but<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:07.040> okay<00:04:07.310> for<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.670> game<00:04:07.880> what

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
special but it's okay for this game what

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.790 
special but it's okay for this game what
are<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.660> all<00:04:08.750> about<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.110> music<00:04:09.260> about<00:04:09.650> the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
are you all about the music about the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.960 
are you all about the music about the
music<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:11.860> there<00:04:12.860> are<00:04:12.980> no<00:04:13.100> sound<00:04:13.430> effects<00:04:13.790> as

music is there are no sound effects as
you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.240> hear<00:04:14.510> no<00:04:15.230> jumping<00:04:15.680> sound<00:04:15.950> as<00:04:16.070> a

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
you can hear no jumping sound as a

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:34.249 
I am then you will die you see on the

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.019 
I am then you will die you see on the
tablet<00:05:34.759> it's<00:05:34.939> you<00:05:35.659> can<00:05:35.839> pray<00:05:36.110> really<00:05:36.889> good<00:05:37.279> but

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
tablet it's you can pray really good but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.209 
tablet it's you can pray really good but
if<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.360> play<00:05:38.569> it<00:05:38.599> on<00:05:38.779> a<00:05:38.809> bigger<00:05:39.050> tablet<00:05:39.589> it

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
if you play it on a bigger tablet it

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.959 
if you play it on a bigger tablet it
could<00:05:40.639> be<00:05:41.029> a<00:05:41.059> little<00:05:41.479> bit<00:05:42.099> you<00:05:43.099> know<00:05:43.129> dangerous
