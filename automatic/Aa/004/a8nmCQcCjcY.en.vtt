on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> front<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.279> part<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
on the front and that's all part of the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540 
on the front and that's all part of the
X<00:00:33.239> frame<00:00:33.809> design<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.770> come<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.219> skate

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
X frame design that come with this skate

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
X frame design that come with this skate
and<00:00:35.790> they're<00:00:36.239> gonna<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.600> 83<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> hardness<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and they're gonna be 83 a hardness so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.380 
and they're gonna be 83 a hardness so
they're<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.489> gonna<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.790> geared<00:00:39.059> toward

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they're really gonna be geared toward

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
they're really gonna be geared toward
you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.320> smoother<00:00:40.680> surfaces<00:00:41.160> rougher

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you know smoother surfaces rougher

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.979 
you know smoother surfaces rougher
conditions<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.149> sort<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> thing<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> handles

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
conditions that sort of thing it handles

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
conditions that sort of thing it handles
it<00:00:43.079> great<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.950> they're<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.280> designed<00:00:44.399> for

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it great but they're really designed for

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
it great but they're really designed for
speed<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.690> course<00:00:45.899> they're<00:00:46.050> gonna<00:00:46.140> come

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
speed and of course they're gonna come

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.490 
speed and of course they're gonna come
with<00:00:46.620> ilq9<00:00:47.550> bearings<00:00:47.840> socketed<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.170> so

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
with ilq9 bearings socketed in there so

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.540 
with ilq9 bearings socketed in there so
you<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.680> obviously<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> nice

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
you got obviously going to get a nice

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
you got obviously going to get a nice
smooth<00:00:50.910> roll<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> frame<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
smooth roll out of it frame on this is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.200 
smooth roll out of it frame on this is
an<00:00:52.770> aluminum<00:00:52.980> frame<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.789> said<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
an aluminum frame and like I said it is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.610 
an aluminum frame and like I said it is
gonna<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:55.020> sizes<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.590> make

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
gonna be two different sizes so make

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.959 
gonna be two different sizes so make
sure<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.010> you're<00:00:56.129> reordering<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:56.760> wheels

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sure when you're reordering those wheels

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
sure when you're reordering those wheels
you<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> appropriate<00:00:57.629> sizes<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you get the appropriate sizes and as you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
you get the appropriate sizes and as you
can<00:00:59.160> tell<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> does<00:00:59.640> come<00:00:59.910> with<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> break

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
can tell it does come with a break

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
can tell it does come with a break
attached<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> excellent<00:01:01.920> option<00:01:02.190> for

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
attached to it excellent option for

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.590 
attached to it excellent option for
those<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.699> still<00:01:02.879> looking<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> control

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
those that are still looking to control

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
those that are still looking to control
their<00:01:03.750> speed<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> boot<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
their speed on the boot it is going to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
their speed on the boot it is going to
be<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> course<00:01:05.909> k2<00:01:06.450> softboot<00:01:07.200> technology<00:01:07.320> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
be of course k2 softboot technology so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
be of course k2 softboot technology so
it's<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> ventilation

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's going to have a lot of ventilation

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's going to have a lot of ventilation
going<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.740> that's<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.159> part

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going through and that's actually part

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
going through and that's actually part
of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> design<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of the design on this it is using the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
of the design on this it is using the
Vortech<00:01:13.890> ventilation<00:01:14.580> system<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.689> are

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
Vortech ventilation system so there are

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
Vortech ventilation system so there are
multiple<00:01:15.930> ventilation<00:01:16.770> points<00:01:17.159> throughout

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
multiple ventilation points throughout

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
multiple ventilation points throughout
the<00:01:17.820> skate<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.509> add<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> air<00:01:18.990> flow<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> help

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the skate that add to air flow and help

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.899 
the skate that add to air flow and help
reduce<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> moisture<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
reduce a lot of the moisture on the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.690 
reduce a lot of the moisture on the
inside<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.200> cuff<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.770> guy<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.009> great<00:01:23.490> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
inside the cuff on this guy is great for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
inside the cuff on this guy is great for
adding<00:01:23.790> stability<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.750> ankle<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
adding stability to your ankle and
