00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 beautiful all the boys are placed e 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.760
 boiling are always here on a par 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.900
 this new zombie map 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.900
 finally after a while I had 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 let's say a moment to continue with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 this ester that is the last time there 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.090
 we were left at this exact point 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 where we had practically put in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 show lantern etc this appeared 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.989
 code code that practically every line 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 what you see here are three sentences three 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 lines that will be three sentences and each sentence 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 practically it will be a name of a cartel 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 that we will find in the galleries of the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 our mine practically in the side 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 top of our maps these 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.879
 signs like you may already know who doesn't 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 he knows and will be five 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.979
 practically since these are here 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 our code will be withdrawn 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.380
 composed of three sentences are three signs 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.530
 the problem now is finding which ones 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.130
 signs since they are five and he is there 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 will give three names what the problem will be 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.409
 will be what the flow will be from 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 hit with our apulia shot 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.869
 electric to practically have to have 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.630
 the electric knuckles these will be i 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 five signs the names of the five 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.450
 we will find signs that we will find in the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.220
 our gallery and we will have to hit it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.759
 only three 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 now for each sign there will be 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.899
 articulate each sentence if you have the canvas 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 all 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.159
 practically yes the whole network decoding 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.219
 and you will find all the full name but 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 this is a process practically 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.600
 useless since we will lose some 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 time will also be a bit boring we say 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 So what brings you here brings you 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.280
 practically every symbol that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 practically there will be five symbols 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.530
 these five symbols you see on the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.319
 video will be the first the first letter 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.300
 No, practically in the first sign it will be 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.970
 this symbol was equivalent to the first 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.130
 letter of our sentence gave him 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 that all the letters of the signs 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.890
 will be different from the first letter e 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.170
 road signs different from each other 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 will only serve to know what symbol 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.390
 we could as we say we could 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.080
 place the first one next to yours 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.660
 sentence in this case this code which 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.900
 will give us in this game 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.540
 and here it is worth to these three folders in 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.190
 Simply put it is, then the other two 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.920
 signs will be of no use to us 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.470
 in fact these will be the three signs 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.680
 that we should use every game that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.900
 we will make the code will change therefore seeing 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.239
 also this video to fix minutes give 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 to hit the signs that hit you 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.579
 practically because the code changes 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.250
 every game that wall but as I have you 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.040
 having said that all you need to know are these five 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.560
 letters 5 simons that I have placed in 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.910
 this video to know which signs 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.079
 exactly should hit 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.359
 now that you know how what signs 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.630
 you will have to hit just go upstairs 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:44.519
 the galleries as I told you before 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.329
 you must have for perhaps the brass knuckles 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.310
 electric or I also heard with the 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.890
 ballistic knife but I do n't 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.200
 try then I can't tell you if this 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.450
 what is true or not 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.489
 as you see now I had already hit 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.730
 these signs once it hit the net 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.569
 this signs every sign that the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.720
 code will give you will mark will come out 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.350
 practically like a red aura around 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.049
 at the sign and you will also hear a sound 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.850
 if the right signs will be if i 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.010
 signs that would have struck will be 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.990
 right in the third kick 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.990
 it is a 20 hit that is the last that 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.280
 would have hit practically come out 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.690
 this electric sphere this sphere 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.820
 practically will have to make a path for 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.620
 in the map on the map because around 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.540
 the map will have to do a well path 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 formed will almost always be the same 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.580
 path this time cut down 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.580
 farm but based on the signs that 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.630
 it should hit pretty much maybe 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.490
 that once in a while 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.890
 this light must be spoken publicly 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.150
 in the first area where there is in front of the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.670
 bank turn around in this match me 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.340
 did practically cut that 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.140
 piece ii and therefore I could not 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.660
 show it to you but if you are three 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.810
 players usually get a person yes 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.180
 place the other in front of the bank 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.700
 person positions himself in front of the saloon 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.320
 in the third person will be near here for 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.170
 put the last area of ​​the cemetery 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.910
 or he will go with the first person who 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:31.740
 struck from the signs in a few words 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.500
 tonight it will feed on the strength of 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.970
 zombie therefore on its way to 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.990
 to get the sphere will have to be 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.970
 of zombies 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.680
 if there will be no zombies it did not hit 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.270
 the zombie knots the ball the sphere 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.150
 will disappear in the first case in the second 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.270
 in the evening it could even disappear if 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.300
 do not you keep it in clear sight 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.810
 now I was in the perimeter of the second 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.030
 round 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.420
 he was alone in this match 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.940
 succeeded equally even by itself if 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.210
 you will make witches if you want to do 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.710
 leicester and so I recommend you 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.500
 make the game yourself in the match 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.710
 excused sorry 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.110
 I advise you to play a game 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.580
 personalized original difficulty 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.120
 obviously because they are being like 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.970
 you can complete it and I recommend you 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.290
 playing alone up to this point is 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.670
 much easier 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.650
 In my opinion, we say a lot more 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.290
 faster also due to the fact that maybe 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.070
 in four many people sometimes pass the 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.230
 round so on 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.990
 as you well know more networks ahead the more 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.330
 it will be difficult to make this ester 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.860
 therefore I advise you to go into the game 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.510
 personalized about it until this 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.400
 point once you get to this point 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:00.650
 activated the two lights and twice after 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.350
 that you have brought to light twice 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.500
 at this point of the gallows then 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.540
 crush your three you are invited 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.850
 friends because in the next two steps 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.940
 practically there are too many networks being in 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.430
 four people now I hope this 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.919
 video there was useful that he had that 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.010
 have at least explained the concept a little 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:25.130
 of this code that you have understood 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.020
 TV overflow is useful if this has been 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.840
 so then I invite you to leave a beautiful one 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.580
 like a comment, maybe we'll see you later 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.180
 to the next video in the next two steps 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.180
 of witches
