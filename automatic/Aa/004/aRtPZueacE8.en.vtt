00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:14.629
 there it is there is the terracotta strong 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:20.710
 point I have late evening last night 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.710
 sprayed with black primed and 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.230
 then again with a brown coat 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:33.940
 So it's a shade of brown, I think 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:37.310
 from ambiente of the farmers do and pseudo 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.020
 airbrush did not hand 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.760
 probably arrived at the lift 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.970
 I wanted the entrances a bit 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.400
 mark very easily 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.750
 with such a sand effect so completely 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.890
 rudimentary with spray can easy 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.950
 just a bit where the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 doors are or indicate anna 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.950
 and with the stairs everywhere 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.309
 the stairs are where in which potentially 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.970
 So walking is so sand 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.350
 Effect that it is just the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.940
 primer is fast there is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.150
 Of course, landed on the railing 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.650
 on the targets 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.290
 but i have to say for out of the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.300
 spray can it's okay you have to, of course 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.410
 very sensitive are very careful 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.730
 proceed with the airbrush for the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.630
 of course much better but I have 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:38.230
 no something yes now i still want that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.240
 rockets in any case mean and 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.950
 maybe a little something from 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.600
 look at these fans here how far I am 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.280
 come for this relationship because it's enough 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.420
 probably not this one anymore 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.479
 not by default this at the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.190
 walls swapping batteries while the have 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.510
 I made it here because I was at the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.620
 at least thought that I'm pretty cool 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.170
 and let her know again 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.080
 more powerful and tells the whole thing 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.080
 a bit more imposing 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:16.569
 otherwise this is the band lights 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.739
 I like the cattenom 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.989
 I have a lot here 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.040
 made over here up here 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.300
 So if you go over it more often 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300
 logically, it gets darker too 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.130
 I am very happy about the acler here 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.019
 should with 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.860
 heavenly body will probably be redone 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.780
 then of course, then of course 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.260
 right here the two eagles at the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.810
 page would be 3 and just at the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:54.530
 side still the eagle the barrels become 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:58.910
 then painted from the coal stream point the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.019
 rockets painted and let's see what I 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.440
 otherwise fix 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:09.230
 the shorter the time the best stability 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:12.980
 here, of course, the eagle and here 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.630
 On top of the battlements, the best is also the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.250
 I wanted to fly over there 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.829
 cockpits go and just as soon as that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.609
 whole other models still eagle the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:29.450
 ornate eagle 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.470
 that would be the forefront of this and that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.190
 I already had cockpit yesterday 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.400
 started 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.709
 I overpainted that naked so without 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.750
 Primer and no reason boys color 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.690
 At least I did not know that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.480
 color that I used for that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.940
 military like green that color 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.730
 Covering is therefore as actually as 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.780
 I am very suitable for priming 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.139
 probably no more done 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.739
 here is still this schematic I from 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.560
 Mr. biskind should have something in the direction 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.930
 it will 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.069
 What else I heard on the internet 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.060
 maybe have in connection to the 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.980
 video from yesterday 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.780
 The vendetta is supposed to be more expensive 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.139
 and it is actually supposed to be in the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 slot give Valkyrie 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.439
 maybe it will be too 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.000
 can be upgraded despite everything too 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.960
 a vendetta one will see 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.979
 as I said everything is also rumored 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.120
 and I would be very annoyed if that 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.949
 fall out of upper limit 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.620
 but I believe that I have in mine 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.410
 video already said too sometimes 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.300
 which ordered okay that 's it 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.210
 so far as to demonstrate kulas 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.970
 strong point tempesta space or from the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.400
 september is the fire base i would 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.580
 it once with the barrels from that of 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.930
 Bentley back there or with a city 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.490
 after or storm blade with the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.190
 try red here it is pretty 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.970
 gaudy but if he something 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.570
 goes wrong I still have here my 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:10.240
 tractor with the chains I also from 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.220
 the superheavy again here from area 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.470
 and i find the result for says kuhl 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.400
 and let's see what happens 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.400
 then ultimately looks like 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.020
 until then it'll be good
