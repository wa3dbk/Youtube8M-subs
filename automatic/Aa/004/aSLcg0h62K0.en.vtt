far up starts here look at on this side
it<00:02:56.540> goes<00:02:56.690> down<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> way<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.530> handle<00:02:57.890> here

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
it goes down all the way the handle here

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.000 
it goes down all the way the handle here
the<00:02:59.600> bevels<00:02:59.990> are<00:03:00.110> different<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.620> each<00:03:00.680> side

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the bevels are different on each side

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.270 
the bevels are different on each side
and<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:02.240> there's<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.050> slight<00:03:03.380> convex<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.040> it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
and there there's a slight convex to it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.070 
and there there's a slight convex to it
and<00:03:04.430> uneven<00:03:04.910> convex<00:03:05.450> all<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.960> way<00:03:06.050> through<00:03:06.320> so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
and uneven convex all the way through so

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.240 
and uneven convex all the way through so
i<00:03:09.080> don't<00:03:09.320> know<00:03:09.380> i'm<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.740> try<00:03:09.890> putting

scandi grind i'm going to try putting an

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.710 
scandi grind i'm going to try putting an
edge<00:03:21.830> on<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.100> as<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.610> without<00:03:23.090> taking<00:03:23.630> this

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
edge on it as is without taking this

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.110 
edge on it as is without taking this
partial<00:03:24.200> convex<00:03:24.650> off<00:03:24.890> on<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.640> grind<00:03:25.970> and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
partial convex off on the grind and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.550 
partial convex off on the grind and
redoing<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.600> whole<00:03:26.720> grind<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.140> don't<00:03:27.320> think<00:03:27.470> I

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
redoing the whole grind I don't think I

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.710 
redoing the whole grind I don't think I
want<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.860> do<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.100> yet<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:29.180> want<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.510> make

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
want to do that yet just want to make

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.540 
want to do that yet just want to make
this<00:03:29.900> thing<00:03:30.080> sharp<00:03:30.440> enough<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.709> use<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.340> try

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
this thing sharp enough to use and try

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.580 
this thing sharp enough to use and try
it<00:03:34.239> we'll<00:03:35.239> see<00:03:35.510> lanyard<00:03:36.020> hole<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.260> nice<00:03:36.410> and

big easily fits paracord or well that's
all<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.430> stuck<00:03:40.760> through<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.180> far<00:03:41.390> as

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
all I stuck through it so far as

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.630 
all I stuck through it so far as
paracord<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.260> easily<00:03:42.560> fit<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.459> that's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
paracord but easily fit that so that's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.130 
paracord but easily fit that so that's
nice<00:03:47.350> it's<00:03:48.350> got<00:03:48.530> some<00:03:48.739> half<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:49.580> know

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140

nice it's got some half to it you know
it's<00:03:51.140> my<00:03:51.290> initial<00:03:52.450> thoughts<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:53.810> the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's my initial thoughts but the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.080 
it's my initial thoughts but the
unboxing<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.830> mean<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:57.100> dull<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:59.860> I<00:04:00.940> don't<00:04:01.940> like

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090

of<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:15.410> sheath<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:16.450> nicer<00:04:17.450> than<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.630> knife

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
of this sheath is nicer than a knife

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.620 
of this sheath is nicer than a knife
itself<00:04:18.640> pretty<00:04:19.640> nice<00:04:19.880> if<00:04:20.269> you're<00:04:20.419> into

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
itself pretty nice if you're into

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.200 
itself pretty nice if you're into
leather<00:04:20.810> sheets<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.470> am<00:04:21.680> NOT

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.300 

the<00:04:26.210> retention<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.930> really<00:04:27.770> good<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.070> mean<00:04:28.220> this

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
the retention is really good I mean this

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.100 
the retention is really good I mean this
is<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.460> good<00:04:28.640> sheath<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.600> thing<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.810> don't<00:04:29.870> like

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
is a good sheath one thing I don't like

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.690 
is a good sheath one thing I don't like
is<00:04:31.570> how<00:04:32.570> high<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.740> thing<00:04:33.800> rides<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.580> your

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
is how high this thing rides on your

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.420 
is how high this thing rides on your
belt<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.350> don't<00:04:36.350> like<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.680> because<00:04:36.920> then<00:04:37.130> this

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
belt I don't like that because then this

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.460 
belt I don't like that because then this
handle<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.300> riding<00:04:38.660> up<00:04:38.780> pretty<00:04:38.990> high<00:04:39.050> for<00:04:39.200> me

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
handle is riding up pretty high for me

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.020 
handle is riding up pretty high for me
that<00:04:39.680> bugs<00:04:39.950> me<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:40.400> I'm<00:04:40.760> not<00:04:41.210> into<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.570> at<00:04:41.630> all

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
that bugs me so I'm not into that at all

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.520 
that bugs me so I'm not into that at all
it's<00:04:44.030> another<00:04:44.240> reason<00:04:44.600> i<00:04:44.660> prefer<00:04:45.050> kydex

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
it's another reason i prefer kydex

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.950 
it's another reason i prefer kydex
because<00:04:45.740> i<00:04:45.830> can<00:04:46.010> tweak<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.030> some<00:04:47.390> you<00:04:47.900> know

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
because i can tweak that some you know

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.030 
because i can tweak that some you know
if<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.410> gets<00:04:48.530> wet<00:04:48.800> whatever<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.570> prefer

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
if it gets wet whatever I just prefer

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.740 
if it gets wet whatever I just prefer
kydex<00:04:52.040> or<00:04:52.250> some<00:04:52.580> kind<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.790> cosmic<00:04:53.300> composite

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
kydex or some kind of cosmic composite

material<00:04:54.580> for<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.610> sheath<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.810> one<00:04:56.960> thing<00:04:57.170> I

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
material for a sheath the one thing I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.750 
material for a sheath the one thing I
might<00:04:57.470> do<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:58.730> try<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.570> make<00:04:59.720> some<00:05:00.170> kind<00:05:00.350> of

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
might do is try to make some kind of

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.520 
might do is try to make some kind of
dangle<00:05:01.760> system<00:05:02.120> for<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.450> maybe<00:05:02.960> try<00:05:03.350> that

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
dangle system for this maybe try that

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.040 
dangle system for this maybe try that
out<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:04.280> doesn't<00:05:04.660> work<00:05:05.660> for<00:05:05.690> me<00:05:05.870> i'll

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
out that doesn't work for me i'll

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.690 
out that doesn't work for me i'll
probably<00:05:06.200> be<00:05:06.380> ditching<00:05:06.590> this<00:05:06.860> for<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.610> know

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
probably be ditching this for you know

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.810 
probably be ditching this for you know
