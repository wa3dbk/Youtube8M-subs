00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
again when it comes to the issue of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
again when it comes to the issue of
bullying<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:44.130> frustrating

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bullying and it's really frustrating

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
bullying and it's really frustrating
