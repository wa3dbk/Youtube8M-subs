00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
here's the nineteen thirty ford model a

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.610 
here's the nineteen thirty ford model a
i<00:00:07.370> just<00:00:08.370> installed<00:00:08.580> some<00:00:09.480> new<00:00:09.960> distributor

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
i just installed some new distributor

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.150 
i just installed some new distributor
parts<00:00:10.950> on<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:12.080> that<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.170> Roberta<00:00:13.469> body<00:00:13.710> cap

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
parts on it that is Roberta body cap

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.439 
parts on it that is Roberta body cap
rotor<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:19.340> that's<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
rotor and that's it for now I do have a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.429 
rotor and that's it for now I do have a
condenser<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.920> points

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
condenser to put in it as well as points

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
condenser to put in it as well as points
but<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> haven't<00:00:25.800> done<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.980> yet<00:00:26.240> I'll<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
but I haven't done that yet I'll do a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230 
but I haven't done that yet I'll do a
start-up<00:00:27.779> here<00:00:28.109> real<00:00:28.320> quick<00:00:29.029> having<00:00:30.029> an<00:00:30.090> issue

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
start-up here real quick having an issue

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.270 
start-up here real quick having an issue
with<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:32.070> tapping<00:00:32.850> sound<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> I'd<00:00:35.219> like

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
with this tapping sound and so I'd like

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.780 
with this tapping sound and so I'd like
to<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.640> able<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.380> figured<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.520> I'll

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to be able to get it figured out so I'll

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.600 
to be able to get it figured out so I'll
start<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.329> real<00:00:39.570> quick<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.079> we'll

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
start it up real quick and then we'll

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.770 
start it up real quick and then we'll
let<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> listen<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
let you listen to it and see what you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:04:54.439 
let you listen to it and see what you
think

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.629 

so<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.509> seems<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.289> first<00:04:56.949> and<00:04:57.190> second

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
so it seems like the first and second

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.650 
so it seems like the first and second
cylinders<00:04:58.180> have<00:04:59.009> quite<00:05:00.009> a<00:05:00.039> bit<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.610> power<00:05:01.419> to

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
cylinders have quite a bit of a power to

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.409 
cylinders have quite a bit of a power to
him<00:05:01.780> when<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.530> grounded<00:05:02.979> him<00:05:03.099> out<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:04.180> really

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
him when I grounded him out you really

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.570 
him when I grounded him out you really
love<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:04.750> engine<00:05:05.050> down<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:06.190> third<00:05:06.430> and

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
love the engine down the third and

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.170 
love the engine down the third and
fourth<00:05:06.789> not<00:05:07.389> so<00:05:07.630> much<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.639> someone<00:05:10.000> could

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
fourth not so much so if someone could

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.330 
fourth not so much so if someone could
critique<00:05:10.419> that<00:05:10.830> kind<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.860> tell<00:05:12.069> me<00:05:12.099> what<00:05:12.220> I

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
critique that kind of tell me what I

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.180 
critique that kind of tell me what I
need<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.580> do<00:05:12.900> I'm<00:05:13.900> sure<00:05:14.139> I've<00:05:14.710> never<00:05:14.949> done<00:05:15.130> a

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
need to do I'm sure I've never done a

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.460 
need to do I'm sure I've never done a
compression<00:05:15.699> test<00:05:15.910> on<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.270> when<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.050> bought<00:05:17.229> the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
compression test on it when I bought the

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.629 
compression test on it when I bought the
car<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.729> hadn't<00:05:19.030> run<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.330> 10<00:05:19.539> years<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:21.340> third

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
car it hadn't run in 10 years the third

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.370 
car it hadn't run in 10 years the third
exhaust<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.270> second<00:05:22.569> third<00:05:22.750> exhaust<00:05:23.050> valves

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
exhaust the second third exhaust valves

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.189 
exhaust the second third exhaust valves
are<00:05:23.470> stuck<00:05:23.680> open<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.490> she<00:05:24.699> turned<00:05:25.389> over<00:05:25.659> got

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
are stuck open so she turned over got

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.969 
are stuck open so she turned over got
those<00:05:26.380> freed<00:05:26.740> up<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:28.409> got<00:05:29.409> her<00:05:29.500> time<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.860> write

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
those freed up and got her time to write

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.700 
those freed up and got her time to write
and<00:05:30.099> she<00:05:30.190> fired<00:05:30.460> off<00:05:30.699> just<00:05:31.470> doesn't<00:05:32.470> seem<00:05:32.590> like

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
and she fired off just doesn't seem like

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.399 
and she fired off just doesn't seem like
it<00:05:32.830> has<00:05:32.949> a<00:05:32.979> lot<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.250> power<00:05:33.990> I'm<00:05:34.990> putting<00:05:35.319> those

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
it has a lot of power I'm putting those

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.920 
it has a lot of power I'm putting those
new<00:05:35.620> distributor<00:05:36.069> parts<00:05:36.310> on<00:05:36.460> did<00:05:36.639> help<00:05:36.849> I<00:05:37.120> know

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
new distributor parts on did help I know

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.550 
new distributor parts on did help I know
I<00:05:38.319> did<00:05:38.770> notice<00:05:39.069> that<00:05:39.220> when<00:05:39.550> I<00:05:39.639> drove<00:05:39.849> it<00:05:39.940> around

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
I did notice that when I drove it around

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.649 
I did notice that when I drove it around
but<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:42.669> just<00:05:42.970> doesn't<00:05:43.120> seem<00:05:43.360> like<00:05:43.509> it's

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
but it just doesn't seem like it's

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.520 
but it just doesn't seem like it's
running<00:05:44.050> as<00:05:44.319> good<00:05:45.039> as<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.370> could<00:05:45.639> be<00:05:46.530> so

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
running as good as it could be so

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.089 
running as good as it could be so
hopefully<00:05:48.060> somebody<00:05:49.060> could<00:05:49.830> kind<00:05:50.830> of<00:05:50.860> let<00:05:51.009> me

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
hopefully somebody could kind of let me

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.860 
hopefully somebody could kind of let me
know<00:05:51.219> what's<00:05:51.400> going<00:05:51.430> on<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:52.030> tap<00:05:52.300> tapping

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
know what's going on that tap tapping

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.510 
know what's going on that tap tapping
sound<00:05:53.110> too<00:05:53.320> is<00:05:53.440> I'm<00:05:53.560> sure<00:05:53.740> it's<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:53.949> valve<00:05:54.159> I

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
sound too is I'm sure it's a valve I

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.279 
sound too is I'm sure it's a valve I
wonder<00:05:55.180> if<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.360> needs<00:05:55.509> to<00:05:55.630> be<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:58.169> wonder<00:05:59.169> if<00:05:59.229> it

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
wonder if it needs to be I wonder if it

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.689 
wonder if it needs to be I wonder if it
needs<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.530> valve<00:05:59.710> job<00:05:59.830> on<00:06:00.219> that<00:06:00.250> fourth

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
needs a valve job on that fourth

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.670 
needs a valve job on that fourth
cylinder<00:06:01.270> that's<00:06:01.960> where<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.199> tapping<00:06:02.590> is

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
cylinder that's where that tapping is

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.659 
cylinder that's where that tapping is
coming<00:06:03.009> from<00:06:04.590> blood<00:06:05.590> than<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.889> she<00:06:06.159> starts

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
coming from blood than that she starts

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.850 
coming from blood than that she starts
up<00:06:06.849> fine<00:06:07.800> show<00:06:08.800> down<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.130> road<00:06:09.340> just<00:06:10.330> like<00:06:10.860> to

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
up fine show down the road just like to

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.709 
up fine show down the road just like to
maybe<00:06:12.460> get<00:06:12.669> a<00:06:12.729> little<00:06:12.789> more<00:06:13.030> power<00:06:13.270> out<00:06:13.389> of<00:06:13.539> it

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
maybe get a little more power out of it

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.870 
maybe get a little more power out of it
then<00:06:13.930> then<00:06:14.800> what<00:06:15.069> and<00:06:15.130> then<00:06:15.460> what<00:06:15.550> she's

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
then then what and then what she's

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.640 
then then what and then what she's
producing<00:06:16.419> seems<00:06:16.960> like<00:06:17.169> she's<00:06:17.380> kind<00:06:17.530> of

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
producing seems like she's kind of

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.480 
producing seems like she's kind of
lacking<00:06:17.860> right<00:06:18.280> now<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.810> anyway<00:06:20.740> there's<00:06:21.159> the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
lacking right now so anyway there's the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.700 
lacking right now so anyway there's the
there's<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.389> startup<00:06:22.900> of<00:06:23.080> the<00:06:23.199> model<00:06:23.530> a<00:06:23.680> and

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
there's the startup of the model a and
