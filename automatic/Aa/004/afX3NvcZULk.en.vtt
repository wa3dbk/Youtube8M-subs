00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.799
 Welcome to the furor warrior 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.600
 ripe for patch 5.4 and is already in the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.700
 added new format 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 in comparison to the other stinginess 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.809
 the first video is that relatively short and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.759
 max maybe house can be 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 not a pure plaintive guide to be such a couple 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.529
 minutes only no that's it intro quasi 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 to you to Vehlen from here 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.010
 which category would like to jump 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.869
 That's why it's imperative that you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
 your note in your youtube player 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.340
 activated that you do in the bottom right in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.660
 a player and then he can do that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.340
 Of course, see also because I have 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 this also divided into different 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 categories become the first category 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 the attributes which attribute sad 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.210
 to play circumnavigated warrior to successfully 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.059
 to be a tall warrior the second 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 would be skills which skills couple 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.840
 around a rotation and for mine 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 Priorities list then comes naturally 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.100
 Talents and examine which talents 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 which talents I use in the optimal case 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 and which glyphs are recommended 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 next the game way to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.480
 playfully also belongs to why do 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.460
 I do not hurt as much as a humor warrior 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 why do others do so much or what 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 maybe I'm wrong in principle 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 at my play way 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 because compared to other ways of playing 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.210
 to other specializations to others 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.320
 Classes can be quite wrong 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 make with cures 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 so I will also go into it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.549
 and of course we still have that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.840
 rotation which rotation and 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.630
 I then have priority list at all 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.710
 what did i have to hold around 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 reasonably harm many 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 and yes depending on which category 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.689
 just want to jump click on 1 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 from those of the notes and then 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 Do you come directly to the appropriate video 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 that's why I have the videos too short 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 it makes the thing for me 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.060
 easier and that makes the case for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.869
 easier if you have some video 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 or 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.829
 then you need some category 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.770
 you do not need 30 minutes before 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.229
 to look at or in some way like in the video 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 to look for any section you like 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 Come right there and that's what it does 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.219
 It's easier for me too 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.290
 quite simply individual, yes single 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.939
 chapter can replace if it is any 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.729
 a hotfix gives that something basic 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.890
 changes or if 5.5 still comes 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.500
 and something can change with me 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.500
 this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.270
 with this system, as it were, always the guide 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.970
 to keep up to date I hope 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.040
 do you like the new system of the new 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.810
 the new outfit from riding and in this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.920
 Sense wishes you much fun while I am 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 outside we see you next 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.310
 chapter
