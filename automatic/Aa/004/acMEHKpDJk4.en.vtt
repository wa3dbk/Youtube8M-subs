00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 the light and I do not know how it is that you I am 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 rodrigo and the video of today is very short 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 It's really just to take the test of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 recording quality of the recorder 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.789
 digital sony fish 312 and you can 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 be wondering and then what is a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.350
 great digital swimmer because fighting 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.210
 said it here 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.650
 the kind of microphones and one he has a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 microphone on the same line kiosks 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.969
 total mic may now be 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 taller than my mouth 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.649
 if you put it here hidden in my 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 If I chose well here and will talk 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.989
 as it has a much better capture 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 than the single or camera microphone 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.309
 even from multiple camcorders 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 he ends up improving a lot 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.840
 quality of audio and often 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.750
 You watch great videos. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.969
 beers of professional channels come 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 that the album is really cool but it does not 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.170
 nor should because it happens because it is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.030
 so much better than the audio of that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 camera that was expensive and everything else 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
 it is because of this the vast majority of them 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.619
 external capture of the album as it is the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 in case of this video that now capturing it 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.240
 here with digital sony fish recorder 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.210
 312 for example adores in this exact 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 moment you are listening to the audio 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 Original Camera Oab cane that I am 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 using to make this video that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.530
 now you will agree that the audio is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.630
 much less defined has much less 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.479
 quality is with one more video of the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.400
 because of course the capture is smaller it has 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 an entrance is small and to do 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.340
 a high quality capture is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 difficult and turning the audio of the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.680
 fish 312 6 come that improved one more 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 time it has more definition it has less 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 noise only then it is also a 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.210
 The recorder test ends up serving as 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.850
 a tip of what you can do to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 improve video audio quality 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 of you on blogs or of any kind 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.079
 video that you have an interest in 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.729
 do what you're doing now and I want 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.619
 improve a legal advantage of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.090
 recorders so they end up being 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.709
 own recording finished 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.080
 it already works for example you have 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.080
 external microphone input here. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can put the lapel microphone 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.560
 of those little ones here 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 and you'll go there away from the camera 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.330
 puts a recorder in the pocket plugged into 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.769
 a screen and goes on talking and the sound 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.110
 Good thing it sounds like you're talking good 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.489
 front of the camera and is not really 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.099
 talking right in front of the camera is 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.920
 away from the camera but with the recorder 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.970
 with microphone right next to you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.370
 I just hope you like it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 videos to have been helpful if you 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 interested in sony fish 312 eu 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.090
 Unfortunately I will not be able to give many 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.130
 information about it for you because 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.959
 This one is not mine, but for what I gave. 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.650
 a look at the buscapÃ© in the open market and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.860
 military service for around 100 150 200 reais 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.310
 out there I think I think ok these 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.120
 recorders ranging from 80 up to 600 or more 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.280
 real 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.590
 but you can for example use up 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.599
 a smartphone as a recorder 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.519
 he does not have the same capture of a 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.310
 dedicated recorder , but if you put and 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.079
 very close to you and to the camera you have far 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.459
 capturing will certainly be very 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.950
 best 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.109
 video tighten and I liked it if you liked it 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.269
 on my channel and you will be warned about 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.859
 coming on videos on youtube will stay 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.230
 inside all of them 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.280
 Only then I'll stay here for a hug.
