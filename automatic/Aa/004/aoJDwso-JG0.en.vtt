00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
when Australia's on 90 this makes him

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
when Australia's on 90 this makes him
the<00:01:08.250> second<00:01:08.610> most<00:01:08.729> expensive<00:01:08.909> player<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the second most expensive player of the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
the second most expensive player of the
game<00:01:09.740> behind<00:01:10.740> her<00:01:11.010> another<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:14.130> going

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
game behind her another so we're going

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to continue with Latin Ibrahimovic the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920 
to continue with Latin Ibrahimovic the
Paris<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> player<00:01:17.570> moved<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.900> from

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
Paris and I'm a player moved over from

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.359 
Paris and I'm a player moved over from
Milan<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.009> season<00:01:20.450> he<00:01:21.450> has<00:01:21.570> 87<00:01:22.080> dribbling<00:01:22.710> 88

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
Milan this season he has 87 dribbling 88

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.170 
Milan this season he has 87 dribbling 88
shot<00:01:23.670> he<00:01:23.909> goes<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.360> about<00:01:25.189> 450,000<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:27.030> we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
shot he goes for about 450,000 if we

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.510 
shot he goes for about 450,000 if we
find<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> better<00:01:27.570> price<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.520> he's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
find a better price like this one he's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
find a better price like this one he's
massive<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.689> probably<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.259> makes

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
massive so that's probably what makes

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
massive so that's probably what makes
him<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.310> expensive<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.750> he's<00:01:33.900> 1

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
him really expensive I think he's 1

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.550 
him really expensive I think he's 1
meter<00:01:34.460> 97<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.180> he's<00:01:36.329> huge<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:37.229> hard<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
meter 97 so he's huge really hard to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.670 
meter 97 so he's huge really hard to
stop<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> defenders<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:40.470> what

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
stop for the defenders and that's what

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
stop for the defenders and that's what
makes<00:01:41.189> him<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.670> third<00:01:42.270> most<00:01:42.479> expensive

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
makes him the third most expensive

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
makes him the third most expensive
player<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> game<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
player of the game so we're going to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
player of the game so we're going to
continue<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.470> list<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:46.860> franck<00:01:47.220> ribéry<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
continue the list with franck ribéry the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.999 
continue the list with franck ribéry the
French<00:01:48.060> player<00:01:48.329> playing<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.930> buying<00:01:49.590> mention

he<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.700> 93<00:01:51.180> page<00:01:51.390> 93<00:01:51.659> ring<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.500> makes<00:01:52.829> him

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
he has 93 page 93 ring which makes him

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
he has 93 page 93 ring which makes him
with<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.759> probably<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.360> makes<00:01:54.570> him<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
with that probably what makes him the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
with that probably what makes him the
fourth<00:01:55.740> most<00:01:55.920> expensive<00:01:56.490> player<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> game

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
he also goes for about 450,000 if you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
he also goes for about 450,000 if you
find<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.420> yet<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.250> it's<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.760 
find a bit yet like this one it's the
same<00:02:02.549> price<00:02:02.729> i<00:02:02.909> prefer<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.600> Ibrahimovic<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.560> i

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
same price i prefer as Ibrahimovic but i

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.459 
same price i prefer as Ibrahimovic but i
think<00:02:05.719> Ibrahimovic<00:02:06.719> still<00:02:06.960> goes<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.380> about

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
think Ibrahimovic still goes for about

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.560 
think Ibrahimovic still goes for about
10<00:02:07.860> km<00:02:08.069> or<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.580> 20<00:02:08.879> k<00:02:09.030> more
