before those troops come home I mean

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
what would you have to say about that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.570 
what would you have to say about that
well<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.320> think<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.620> margin<00:02:19.070> offensive<00:02:19.490> in

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.160 
well I think the margin offensive in
almost<00:02:19.790> all<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> military<00:02:20.600> actions<00:02:20.990> right

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
almost all of the military actions right

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620 
almost all of the military actions right
