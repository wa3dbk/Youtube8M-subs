this up and then I'll just keep coming
by<00:05:09.620> every<00:05:10.280> once<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.639> while<00:05:10.819> and<00:05:10.999> I'll<00:05:11.060> just

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
by every once in a while and I'll just

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.379 
by every once in a while and I'll just
keep<00:05:11.419> adding<00:05:11.659> this<00:05:11.930> mixture<00:05:12.409> to<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:16.330> all<00:05:17.330> right

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
keep adding this mixture to it all right

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.909 
keep adding this mixture to it all right
so<00:05:17.599> now<00:05:17.689> that<00:05:17.719> this<00:05:17.960> is<00:05:18.020> come<00:05:18.319> back<00:05:18.469> up<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.800> the

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
so now that this is come back up to the

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.439 
so now that this is come back up to the
boil<00:05:19.129> it's<00:05:19.310> going<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.490> be<00:05:19.550> pretty<00:05:19.789> easy<00:05:20.029> to<00:05:20.330> get

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
boil it's going to be pretty easy to get

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.529 
boil it's going to be pretty easy to get
some<00:05:20.659> of<00:05:20.749> this<00:05:20.840> oil<00:05:21.080> off<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.740> top<00:05:21.949> I

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
some of this oil off the top I

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.330 
some of this oil off the top I
definitely<00:05:23.539> don't<00:05:23.629> want<00:05:23.870> my<00:05:23.990> serve<00:05:24.770> greasy

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
definitely don't want my serve greasy

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.390 
definitely don't want my serve greasy
beans<00:05:29.199> one<00:05:30.199> thing<00:05:30.349> you<00:05:30.439> can<00:05:30.590> do<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:30.830> save<00:05:31.129> this

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
beans one thing you can do is save this

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.540 
beans one thing you can do is save this
step<00:05:31.699> is<00:05:31.999> on<00:05:32.960> your<00:05:33.169> seasoning<00:05:33.740> mixture<00:05:34.069> you

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
step is on your seasoning mixture you

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.519 
step is on your seasoning mixture you
could<00:05:34.699> always<00:05:34.879> kind<00:05:35.300> of<00:05:35.389> strain<00:05:35.749> that<00:05:35.779> out<00:05:36.259> I

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
could always kind of strain that out I

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.209 
could always kind of strain that out I
don't<00:05:37.189> I<00:05:37.759> don't<00:05:38.029> really<00:05:38.300> think<00:05:38.509> it's<00:05:38.719> that

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
don't I don't really think it's that

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.830 
don't I don't really think it's that
difficult<00:05:40.219> to<00:05:40.370> do<00:05:40.520> this<00:05:43.479> well<00:05:44.479> you<00:05:44.599> get<00:05:44.719> the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
difficult to do this well you get the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.499 
difficult to do this well you get the
idea<00:05:44.870> what<00:05:45.319> I'm<00:05:45.409> doing

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
idea what I'm doing

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.499 
idea what I'm doing
so<00:05:47.509> no<00:05:47.810> since<00:05:48.050> we<00:05:48.199> took<00:05:48.439> that<00:05:48.650> out<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.979> there

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
so no since we took that out of there

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.850
