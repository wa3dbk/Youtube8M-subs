00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
long enough it'll stop blinking and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
long enough it'll stop blinking and
eventually<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.530> disappear<00:00:41.300> alright

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

hungover and what you want to do is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
hungover and what you want to do is
build<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> blocks<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> they

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
build the blocks up so that they

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.990 
build the blocks up so that they
intersect<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:52.530> three<00:00:52.920> lasers<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> block

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
intersect these three lasers and block

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.680 
intersect these three lasers and block
them<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.690> making<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.039> connection<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
them from making a connection when you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
them from making a connection when you
do<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.109> take<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.920> beam<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> block<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
do that take that one beam and block the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
do that take that one beam and block the
door<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.239> opened<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.620> and

through the door and take the block like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.590 
through the door and take the block like
that<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.890> put<00:01:08.159> them<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> holes<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
want to go to a jump too far now you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.660 
want to go to a jump too far now you
haven't<00:01:28.860> actually<00:01:29.009> been<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.579> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
haven't actually been here but you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
haven't actually been here but you
passed<00:01:29.970> through<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> jump<00:01:30.869> earlier<00:01:31.170> walk

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
passed through on the jump earlier walk

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
passed through on the jump earlier walk
along<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> wall<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.700> pop<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

these<00:01:36.570> crossroads<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:37.950> another<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
these crossroads you'll see another I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.510 
these crossroads you'll see another I
let<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.850> open<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> these<00:01:39.810> things<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
let that open up and these things here

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
let that open up and these things here
they<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.729> nuts<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.329> water<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> walk<00:01:43.470> or

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
they go nuts if you water if you walk or

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.350 
they go nuts if you water if you walk or
run<00:01:44.250> rather<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
run rather so what you want to do is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.719 
run rather so what you want to do is
hold<00:01:45.509> shift<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> walk<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.860> it'll<00:01:47.220> stay<00:01:47.430> green

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
hold shift and walk and it'll stay green

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
hold shift and walk and it'll stay green
the<00:01:47.909> bridge<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.270> stay<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.110> pass

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the bridge will stay there and then pass

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
the bridge will stay there and then pass
straight<00:01:49.710> through<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.100> grab<00:01:50.369> these<00:01:50.579> two

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
straight through here grab these two

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
straight through here grab these two
blue<00:01:51.210> blocks<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.470> block<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.159> laser

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
blue blocks and then block this laser

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
blue blocks and then block this laser
beam<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> front<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> walk

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
beam in the front because if you walk

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510 
beam in the front because if you walk
through<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> door<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.500> shut<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:56.340> up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
through there the door will shut back up

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
through there the door will shut back up
to<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.820> through<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> initial<00:01:57.390> beam<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> open

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to go through the initial beam to open

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
to go through the initial beam to open
the<00:01:58.439> door<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:58.979> pass<00:01:59.219> through<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the door and then pass through here up

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.340 
the door and then pass through here up
these<00:02:00.000> stairs<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> you'll<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> these

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
these stairs and you'll get to these

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
these stairs and you'll get to these
blocks<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.790> had<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.210> stuck<00:02:03.570> for

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
blocks here now this had me stuck for

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
blocks here now this had me stuck for
about<00:02:03.960> an<00:02:04.560> hour<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.340> couldn't<00:02:05.640> work<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.939> what

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
about an hour I couldn't work out what

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
about an hour I couldn't work out what
was<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.869> how<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> multiply<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.770> blocks

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
was going on how to multiply the blocks

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.490 
was going on how to multiply the blocks
but<00:02:08.819> once<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> green<00:02:09.660> gun

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
but once you have the green gun

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
but once you have the green gun
what'll<00:02:10.740> happen<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.100> if<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> make<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.520> square

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
what'll happen is if you make a square

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.690 
what'll happen is if you make a square
it'll<00:02:12.660> fill<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> gaps<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> middle<00:02:13.980> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it'll fill in the gaps in the middle so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.520 
it'll fill in the gaps in the middle so
make<00:02:14.880> an<00:02:15.060> outline<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.720> square<00:02:15.990> there<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
make an outline of a square there and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.170 
make an outline of a square there and
you'll<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:16.890> extra<00:02:16.980> block<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:17.850> take<00:02:18.000> away

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you'll get an extra block then take away

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.250 
you'll get an extra block then take away
the<00:02:18.270> top<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.900> back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the top one put it back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
the top one put it back
you'll<00:02:19.410> get<00:02:19.560> another<00:02:19.860> block<00:02:20.070> once<00:02:20.730> you've<00:02:20.850> got

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you'll get another block once you've got

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.240 
you'll get another block once you've got
three<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.140> build<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.440> bigger<00:02:22.620> block<00:02:22.860> like

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
three you can build a bigger block like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.310 
three you can build a bigger block like
this<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.420> build<00:02:24.630> along<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> top<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> you'll

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this so build along the top and you'll

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.680 
this so build along the top and you'll
get<00:02:25.470> two<00:02:25.650> free<00:02:25.860> blocks<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:26.850> grab<00:02:27.270> those

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
get two free blocks and then grab those

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.080 
get two free blocks and then grab those
three<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.350> build<00:02:29.190> along<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> bottom<00:02:29.670> there

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
three and build along the bottom there

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.570 
three and build along the bottom there
you<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.630> you'll<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.020> three<00:02:31.260> blocks<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you go and you'll get three blocks and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.449 
you go and you'll get three blocks and
then<00:02:32.970> work<00:02:33.300> your<00:02:33.480> way<00:02:33.540> down<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:34.950> now

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
then work your way down and so on now

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.190 
then work your way down and so on now
once<00:02:35.640> you've<00:02:35.760> got<00:02:35.790> enough<00:02:36.120> blocks<00:02:36.420> then<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.080> go

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
once you've got enough blocks then we go

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.410 
once you've got enough blocks then we go
miss<00:02:37.440> once<00:02:37.980> you've<00:02:38.100> got<00:02:38.250> enough<00:02:38.459> blocks<00:02:38.730> you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
miss once you've got enough blocks you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
miss once you've got enough blocks you
can<00:02:39.450> start<00:02:39.810> building<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> side<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.770> well

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
can start building to the side as well

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
can start building to the side as well
now<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.430> actually<00:02:41.670> don't<00:02:41.970> need<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.330> many<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
now you actually don't need so many you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
now you actually don't need so many you
only<00:02:42.780> need<00:02:42.989> ten<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.830> particular<00:02:44.100> door

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
only need ten for this particular door

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.740 
only need ten for this particular door
but<00:02:44.850> I'm<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.030> showing<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> general

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
but I'm just showing you the general

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.320 
but I'm just showing you the general
principles<00:02:46.170> also<00:02:47.010> avoid<00:02:47.459> taking<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
principles also avoid taking from the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.820 
principles also avoid taking from the
corners<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.410> take<00:02:49.560> from<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
corners because if you take from the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.560 
corners because if you take from the
corner<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.340> will<00:02:50.459> detonate<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.090> entire

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
corner it will detonate the entire

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.910 
corner it will detonate the entire
structure<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.320> you'll<00:02:52.440> actually<00:02:52.560> end<00:02:52.860> up

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
structure and you'll actually end up

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.290 
structure and you'll actually end up
losing<00:02:53.190> bricks<00:02:53.580> you'll<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.940> hit<00:02:54.060> escape

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
losing bricks you'll have to hit escape

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.960 
losing bricks you'll have to hit escape
and<00:02:54.480> come<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:56.280> fill<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.580> those<00:02:56.730> holes

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and come back in but fill up those holes

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.670 
and come back in but fill up those holes
there<00:02:57.209> pass<00:02:57.540> through<00:02:57.750> here<00:02:57.900> take<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> right<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
there pass through here take a right and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.250 
there pass through here take a right and
you'll<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.580> cross<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:01.080> as<00:03:01.200> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you'll get to this cross here now as I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.690 
you'll get to this cross here now as I
mentioned<00:03:01.620> before<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.190> take<00:03:02.400> out<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
mentioned before if you take out the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.170 
mentioned before if you take out the
middle<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> block<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:04.739> will<00:03:05.130> take<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.970> all

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
middle of a block it will take out all

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.760 
middle of a block it will take out all
the<00:03:06.390> blocks<00:03:06.630> attached<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.590> take

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
the blocks attached to it if you take

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.160 
the blocks attached to it if you take
out<00:03:07.890> an<00:03:07.980> intersection<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.170> here

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
out an intersection like this here

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.190 
out an intersection like this here
you'll<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.830> gets<00:03:11.400> rid<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.580> them<00:03:11.700> all<00:03:12.200> now

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
you'll see it gets rid of them all now

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.110 
you'll see it gets rid of them all now
the<00:03:13.260> idea<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.370> want<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.940> these

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the idea here is you want all of these

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.680 
the idea here is you want all of these
beams<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.110> finish<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.920> same<00:03:17.160> time<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
beams to finish at the same time and the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.199 
beams to finish at the same time and the
way<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.530> I'll<00:03:19.920> quickly<00:03:20.610> rebuild

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
way to do that is I'll quickly rebuild

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.259 
way to do that is I'll quickly rebuild
this<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.660> original<00:03:22.019> cross<00:03:23.000> sped<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.090> up<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
this to the original cross sped it up a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.360 
this to the original cross sped it up a
little<00:03:24.360> bit<00:03:24.600> because<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.989> messed<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:26.160> take

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
little bit because I messed up but take

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.039 
little bit because I messed up but take
out<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.580> block<00:03:26.850> here<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:27.989> you

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
out the block here and then what you

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.479 
out the block here and then what you
want<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.380> counted<00:03:28.860> them<00:03:29.010> all<00:03:29.100> quite

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
want to do I counted them all quite

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.220 
want to do I counted them all quite
laborious<00:03:29.640> ly<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.420> build<00:03:30.690> one<00:03:31.049> two

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
laborious ly but then build one two

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.890 
laborious ly but then build one two
three<00:03:31.680> out<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.160> side

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
three out to the side

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.199 
three out to the side
not<00:03:33.900> four<00:03:34.140> three<00:03:34.500> two<00:03:35.070> up<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.940> build

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
not four three two up and then build

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.940 
not four three two up and then build
three<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:36.780> into<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.170> middle<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.739> top

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
three back into the middle for this top

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.069 
three back into the middle for this top
one<00:03:38.130> because<00:03:38.610> that's<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.970> shortest<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
one because that's the shortest one the

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.330 
one because that's the shortest one the
next<00:03:40.320> shortest<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.100> bottom

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
next shortest is the one at the bottom

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.069 
next shortest is the one at the bottom
what<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.700> want<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.970> do<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.180> build<00:03:42.329> two<00:03:42.690> out<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
what you want to do is build two out the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.789 
what you want to do is build two out the
side<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.880> one<00:03:44.880> two<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.420> then<00:03:45.930> two<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:46.380> one

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
side here one two and then two down one

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.880 
side here one two and then two down one
two<00:03:47.100> there<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:47.579> go<00:03:48.049> go<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.560> ran

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
two there we go go on you can do I ran

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.319 
two there we go go on you can do I ran
out<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.070> blocks<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:51.060> new

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
out of blocks you can just get new

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.870 
out of blocks you can just get new
blocks<00:03:51.600> off<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> ones<00:03:52.079> on<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> floor<00:03:52.880> built

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
blocks off the ones on the floor built

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.330 
blocks off the ones on the floor built
two<00:03:54.090> down<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:54.959> two<00:03:55.260> across<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.190> whole

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
two down and then two across the whole

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
two down and then two across the whole
you<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.910> need<00:03:57.060> one<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.140> one<00:03:58.200> on

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
you just need one and then this one on

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.830 
you just need one and then this one on
the<00:03:58.530> left<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.430> next<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.720> we're

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the left is the next one to do so we're

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.030 
the left is the next one to do so we're
going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.019> just<00:04:01.170> grab<00:04:01.290> some<00:04:01.620> more<00:04:01.739> blocks

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
going to just grab some more blocks

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.900 
going to just grab some more blocks
because<00:04:02.310> I've<00:04:02.430> nearly<00:04:02.579> ran<00:04:02.820> out<00:04:02.940> again

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
because I've nearly ran out again

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.320 
because I've nearly ran out again
and<00:04:04.540> then<00:04:04.750> build<00:04:05.020> one<00:04:05.410> down<00:04:05.850> two<00:04:06.850> across<00:04:07.270> and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
and then build one down two across and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.140 
and then build one down two across and
one<00:04:08.020> up<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.620> then<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:09.400> take<00:04:09.640> out<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.910> middle

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
one up and then just take out the middle

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.940 
one up and then just take out the middle
one<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.930> will<00:04:11.050> detonate<00:04:11.290> all<00:04:11.740> these

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
one and that will detonate all these

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.470 
one and that will detonate all these
they'll<00:04:12.220> all<00:04:12.340> disappear<00:04:12.610> at<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.030> same<00:04:13.240> time

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
they'll all disappear at the same time

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.970 
they'll all disappear at the same time
and<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:13.780> run<00:04:14.080> through<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.440> door<00:04:14.650> before<00:04:14.800> it

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
and then run through this door before it

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.370 
and then run through this door before it
shuts<00:04:15.280> then<00:04:16.060> simply<00:04:16.390> take<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.900> block<00:04:17.170> out

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
shuts then simply take this block out

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.199 
shuts then simply take this block out
here<00:04:17.620> pass<00:04:18.100> through<00:04:18.310> here<00:04:18.459> take<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.700> left<00:04:18.970> and

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
here pass through here take a left and

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.570 
here pass through here take a left and
there<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.080> yellow<00:04:20.230> gun<00:04:20.530> now<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.400> yellow

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
there is the yellow gun now the yellow

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.640 
there is the yellow gun now the yellow
gun<00:04:21.880> lets<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.210> move<00:04:22.480> blocks<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.500> should

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
gun lets you move blocks and you should

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.230 
gun lets you move blocks and you should
definitely<00:04:23.800> experiment<00:04:24.670> with<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.910> if<00:04:25.150> you

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
definitely experiment with that if you

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.130 
definitely experiment with that if you
haven't<00:04:25.540> got<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.780> already

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
haven't got it already

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.200 
haven't got it already
it's<00:04:26.770> really<00:04:27.070> nice<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.460> actually<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:28.060> can

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
it's really nice it's actually you can

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.060 
it's really nice it's actually you can
do<00:04:28.300> some<00:04:28.450> cool<00:04:28.630> stuff<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.470> there's<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.770> massive

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
do some cool stuff but there's a massive

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.160 
do some cool stuff but there's a massive
shortcut<00:04:30.820> here<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.540> go<00:04:31.690> back<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.050> very

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
shortcut here so go back to the very

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.740 
shortcut here so go back to the very

is actually right near the end of the
tower<00:04:36.370> which<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.390> kind<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.690> worked<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.140> way<00:04:38.290> up

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
tower which I kind of worked my way up

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.650 
tower which I kind of worked my way up
bit<00:04:38.740> by<00:04:38.920> bit<00:04:39.120> now<00:04:40.120> we're<00:04:40.330> gonna<00:04:40.420> need<00:04:40.600> one

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
bit by bit now we're gonna need one

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.890 
bit by bit now we're gonna need one
block<00:04:41.080> ah<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:42.310> closest<00:04:42.880> one<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.090> could<00:04:43.330> find<00:04:43.360> is

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
block ah the closest one I could find is

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.870 
block ah the closest one I could find is
up<00:04:44.140> here<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.920> take<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.130> right<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.730> is

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
up here and you take a right and this is

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.550 
up here and you take a right and this is
a<00:04:45.910> secret<00:04:46.330> wall<00:04:46.450> pass<00:04:47.020> through<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.470> you'll

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
a secret wall pass through it and you'll

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.960 
a secret wall pass through it and you'll
see<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:47.830> fly<00:04:48.130> sign<00:04:48.400> if<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.640> need<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.850> get

see this fly sign if you need to get

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.490 
see this fly sign if you need to get
across<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.420> what<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.690> do<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:49.840> just<00:04:50.080> build<00:04:50.260> a

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
across here what you do is just build a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.860 
across here what you do is just build a
long<00:04:50.740> line<00:04:50.980> across<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.760> build<00:04:52.510> yourself<00:04:52.600> a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
long line across it and build yourself a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.500 
long line across it and build yourself a
bridge<00:04:53.110> but<00:04:53.920> grab<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.160> block<00:04:54.430> or<00:04:54.580> two<00:04:54.610> head<00:04:55.180> back

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
bridge but grab a block or two head back

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.380 
bridge but grab a block or two head back
here<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.230> then<00:04:56.710> put<00:04:56.860> one<00:04:56.890> block<00:04:57.250> here<00:04:57.550> hold

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
here and then put one block here hold

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.820 
here and then put one block here hold
the<00:04:58.510> middle<00:04:58.720> mouse<00:04:58.840> button<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.530> look

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
the middle mouse button and look

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.710 
the middle mouse button and look
directly<00:05:00.070> up<00:05:00.520> make<00:05:00.790> sure<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.180> beam<00:05:01.390> of<00:05:01.540> light

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
directly up make sure the beam of light

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.690 
directly up make sure the beam of light
is<00:05:02.020> going<00:05:02.350> directly<00:05:02.920> up<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.250> you're<00:05:03.370> nearly<00:05:03.550> in

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
is going directly up so you're nearly in

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.370 
is going directly up so you're nearly in
the<00:05:03.760> middle<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.330> it'll<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:04.780> lift<00:05:05.200> up

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
the middle of it and it'll just lift up

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.040 
the middle of it and it'll just lift up
with<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.980> standing<00:05:06.460> on<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.060> you'll<00:05:07.810> get

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
with you standing on it and you'll get

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.690 
with you standing on it and you'll get
up<00:05:08.260> here<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.590> see<00:05:08.740> it's<00:05:08.890> lifting<00:05:09.190> me<00:05:09.280> up<00:05:09.310> but

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
up here you see it's lifting me up but

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.060 
up here you see it's lifting me up but
make<00:05:10.030> sure<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.540> you<00:05:10.660> jump<00:05:11.050> off<00:05:11.260> into<00:05:11.740> this

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
make sure that you jump off into this

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.820 
make sure that you jump off into this
gap<00:05:12.430> here<00:05:13.000> before<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.900> hit<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.140> top<00:05:14.350> I've

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
gap here before you hit the top I've

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.320 
gap here before you hit the top I've
failed<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.340> first<00:05:15.460> time<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.970> hit<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.150> roof

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
failed the first time and hit the roof

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.960 
failed the first time and hit the roof
and<00:05:16.600> fell<00:05:17.290> off<00:05:17.410> so<00:05:17.680> I'll<00:05:17.890> speed<00:05:18.310> up<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.670> return

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
and fell off so I'll speed up the return

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.950 
and fell off so I'll speed up the return
journey<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:20.380> when<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.620> get<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.919> top<00:05:21.960> jump

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
journey but when you get the top jump

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.670 
journey but when you get the top jump
off<00:05:23.110> into<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.890> doorway<00:05:24.220> here<00:05:24.790> jump<00:05:25.680> head

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
off into this doorway here jump head

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.140 
off into this doorway here jump head
around<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.220> left<00:05:27.400> here<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.880> now<00:05:28.030> you've

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
around to the left here and now you've

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.280 
around to the left here and now you've
got<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.300> bit<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.630> tricky<00:05:28.930> one<00:05:29.020> you're<00:05:29.200> going

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
got a bit of a tricky one you're going

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.320 
got a bit of a tricky one you're going
to<00:05:29.350> be<00:05:29.440> using<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> move<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.430> our<00:05:30.610> technique<00:05:31.120> of

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
to be using the move to our technique of

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.300 
to be using the move to our technique of
the<00:05:31.630> yellow<00:05:31.960> gun<00:05:32.169> what<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:32.860> want<00:05:33.040> to<00:05:33.130> do<00:05:33.190> is

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
the yellow gun what you want to do is

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.740 
the yellow gun what you want to do is
hold<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.610> middle<00:05:33.730> button<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.300> drag<00:05:34.720> the

hold the middle button and drag the
blocks<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.200> there<00:05:35.350> then<00:05:35.830> hold<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.370> up<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.669> drag

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
blocks to there then hold it up and drag

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.340 
blocks to there then hold it up and drag
them<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.060> top<00:05:37.300> then<00:05:37.510> get<00:05:37.690> rid<00:05:37.930> of<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.169> top

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
them to the top then get rid of the top

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.770 
them to the top then get rid of the top
one<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.680> drag<00:05:38.919> them<00:05:39.100> down<00:05:39.390> then<00:05:40.390> get<00:05:40.600> rid<00:05:40.720> of

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
one and drag them down then get rid of

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.020 
one and drag them down then get rid of
the<00:05:40.870> top<00:05:41.020> one<00:05:41.169> again<00:05:41.560> there<00:05:42.160> we<00:05:42.310> go<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:42.730> drag

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
the top one again there we go and drag

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.550 
the top one again there we go and drag
them<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.270> right<00:05:43.510> you'll<00:05:43.720> see<00:05:43.810> if<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:44.290> drag

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
them to the right you'll see if you drag

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.170 
them to the right you'll see if you drag
them<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.830> right<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.430> top<00:05:45.640> one<00:05:45.850> will<00:05:46.030> then

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
them to the right the top one will then

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.450 
them to the right the top one will then
replace<00:05:46.419> itself<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.620> reason<00:05:47.919> we<00:05:48.010> get<00:05:48.190> rid<00:05:48.430> of

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
replace itself the reason we get rid of

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.340 
replace itself the reason we get rid of
it<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.820> because<00:05:49.330> if<00:05:49.450> it's<00:05:49.600> attached<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.200> won't

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
it is because if it's attached it won't

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.620 
it is because if it's attached it won't
stay<00:05:50.620> there<00:05:51.000> then<00:05:52.000> get<00:05:52.180> rid<00:05:52.300> of<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.450> one<00:05:52.540> at

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
stay there then get rid of the one at

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.700 
stay there then get rid of the one at
the<00:05:52.690> bottom<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.080> pull<00:05:53.260> them<00:05:53.380> along<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.680> that

the bottom and pull them along to that

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.409 
the bottom and pull them along to that
and<00:05:54.160> then<00:05:54.280> I<00:05:54.370> like<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.580> pull<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:54.970> one<00:05:55.150> up<00:05:55.360> here

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
and then I like to pull this one up here

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.600 
and then I like to pull this one up here
just<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.440> that<00:05:56.590> you<00:05:56.680> can<00:05:56.800> latch<00:05:57.010> onto<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:57.370> and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.890 
just so that you can latch onto it and
then<00:05:57.790> what<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.030> want<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.240> do<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.570> pull<00:05:58.780> this

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
then what you want to do is pull this

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.170 
then what you want to do is pull this
one<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.830> right<00:06:00.070> and<00:06:00.340> down<00:06:00.669> a<00:06:00.730> little<00:06:01.030> bit

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
one to the right and down a little bit

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.920 
one to the right and down a little bit
to<00:06:01.360> there

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
to there

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.990 
to there
then<00:06:02.560> latch<00:06:02.830> on<00:06:03.039> to<00:06:03.070> one<00:06:03.220> of<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.460> visible<00:06:03.789> ones

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
then latch on to one of the visible ones

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.279 
then latch on to one of the visible ones
because<00:06:04.270> those<00:06:04.389> ones<00:06:04.570> on<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.810> right<00:06:04.960> now<00:06:05.169> are

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
because those ones on the right now are

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.379 
because those ones on the right now are
behind<00:06:05.530> glass<00:06:05.800> then<00:06:06.550> with<00:06:06.729> the<00:06:06.820> button<00:06:07.120> still

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
behind glass then with the button still

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.570 
behind glass then with the button still
held<00:06:07.600> down<00:06:07.870> move<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.740> mouse<00:06:08.889> cursor<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.430> the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
held down move the mouse cursor to the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.999 
held down move the mouse cursor to the
furthest<00:06:09.970> point<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.479> then<00:06:10.960> draw<00:06:11.289> the<00:06:11.350> line<00:06:11.680> to

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
furthest point and then draw the line to

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.430 
furthest point and then draw the line to
the<00:06:12.160> last<00:06:12.370> grid<00:06:12.699> that<00:06:13.419> will<00:06:13.630> open<00:06:13.750> this<00:06:14.169> door

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
the last grid that will open this door

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.340 
the last grid that will open this door
which<00:06:15.039> will<00:06:15.220> get<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.699> red<00:06:15.910> gun<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:17.199> red

from<00:06:47.110> just<00:06:47.440> two<00:06:47.650> blocks<00:06:47.889> you<00:06:48.190> can<00:06:48.340> build<00:06:48.610> up<00:06:48.729> a

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
from just two blocks you can build up a

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.129 
from just two blocks you can build up a
huge<00:06:49.389> amount<00:06:49.870> of<00:06:50.110> blocks<00:06:50.289> very<00:06:50.740> very<00:06:51.220> quickly

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
huge amount of blocks very very quickly

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.589 
huge amount of blocks very very quickly
um<00:06:53.139> anyway<00:06:53.830> that<00:06:54.220> is<00:06:54.520> how<00:06:54.759> to<00:06:54.940> get<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.360> four

you<00:06:57.580> don't<00:06:57.820> do<00:06:58.090> this<00:06:58.270> unless<00:06:58.330> you're<00:06:58.750> just

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
you don't do this unless you're just

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.689 
you don't do this unless you're just
looking<00:06:59.349> to<00:06:59.470> explore<00:06:59.860> the<00:07:00.009> rooms<00:07:00.220> after

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
uploading those tomorrow I'll probably

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.420 
uploading those tomorrow I'll probably
do<00:07:04.840> an<00:07:04.930> annotated<00:07:05.349> map<00:07:05.740> or<00:07:06.039> something<00:07:06.220> like

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
do an annotated map or something like

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.070 
do an annotated map or something like
that<00:07:06.490> where<00:07:06.849> you<00:07:06.940> can<00:07:07.060> just<00:07:07.240> click<00:07:07.570> on<00:07:07.780> the

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
that where you can just click on the

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.500 
that where you can just click on the
view<00:07:08.260> from<00:07:08.320> the<00:07:08.470> antechamber<00:07:09.150> anyway<00:07:10.150> I<00:07:10.180> hope

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
view from the antechamber anyway I hope

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.060 
view from the antechamber anyway I hope
that<00:07:10.780> was<00:07:10.930> useful<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:11.470> will<00:07:11.680> see<00:07:11.830> you<00:07:11.949> in<00:07:12.039> the
