00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
I don't too much grout all at once

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.410 
I don't too much grout all at once
because<00:01:18.740> sometimes<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:19.460> dries<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
because sometimes it just dries the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.290 
because sometimes it just dries the
bottom<00:01:20.690> part<00:01:20.900> dries<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:22.400> do<00:01:22.700> maybe

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
bottom part dries so I just do maybe

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.850 
bottom part dries so I just do maybe
section<00:01:23.690> by<00:01:23.810> section<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.380> I'm<00:01:24.470> gonna<00:01:24.590> start

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
section by section and I'm gonna start

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.610 
section by section and I'm gonna start
off<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.370> roof<00:01:25.810> I'm<00:01:26.810> also<00:01:27.050> going<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.470> add

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
off with the roof I'm also going to add

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.700 
off with the roof I'm also going to add
a<00:01:27.890> little<00:01:28.130> bit<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.430> paint<00:01:29.110> for<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.290> layer<00:01:30.500> I'm

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
a little bit of paint for this layer I'm

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.110 
a little bit of paint for this layer I'm
using<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:31.130> yellow<00:01:31.310> paint<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.790> don't<00:01:32.000> want

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
using a yellow paint you don't want

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.970 
using a yellow paint you don't want
anything<00:01:32.330> too<00:01:32.780> dark<00:01:33.140> really<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.740> will<00:01:33.860> not

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
anything too dark really that will not

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.570 
anything too dark really that will not
interfere<00:01:34.310> with<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.120> final<00:01:35.870> piece<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.650> this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
interfere with the final piece and this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.320 
interfere with the final piece and this
in<00:01:38.060> my<00:01:38.120> case<00:01:38.780> will<00:01:39.170> made<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.190> lot<00:01:40.550> with<00:01:40.940> mixing

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
in my case will made a lot with mixing

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.720 
in my case will made a lot with mixing
with<00:01:41.510> white<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:42.980> optional<00:01:43.550> it

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
with white but this is just optional it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.310 
with white but this is just optional it
definitely<00:01:44.180> helps<00:01:44.510> when<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.690> do<00:01:44.810> other<00:01:45.050> lanes

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
definitely helps when you do other lanes

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:57.070 
definitely helps when you do other lanes
see<00:01:46.190> where<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.700> have<00:01:47.000> blasting

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.510 

okay<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.380> done<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.070> layer<00:01:59.400> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
okay so I'm done with the first layer of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
okay so I'm done with the first layer of
brow<00:01:59.880> remember<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.140> outside

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
job has been a lot harder to do on a
house<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.890> rock<00:02:35.610> project

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
house and it was on the rock project

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.000 
house and it was on the rock project
that<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.510> did<00:02:36.690> before<00:02:37.850> one<00:02:39.049> big<00:02:40.049> issue<00:02:40.319> was<00:02:40.799> all

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that I did before one big issue was all

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.309 
that I did before one big issue was all
the<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.459> gaps<00:02:41.760> between<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:43.049> walls

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
the little gaps between the walls

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.210 
the little gaps between the walls
obviously<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:44.340> they<00:02:44.700> weren't<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:46.220> flat

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
obviously they are they weren't as flat

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.410 
obviously they are they weren't as flat
as<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.519> would<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.760> liked<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.030> when<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> cut

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
as I would have liked is when you cut

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.210 
as I would have liked is when you cut
into<00:02:48.540> polystyrene<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.290> does<00:02:49.500> kind<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.950> break

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
into polystyrene it does kind of break

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.030 
into polystyrene it does kind of break
up<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.549> bit<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.630> what<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> did<00:02:52.019> for<00:02:52.410> things<00:02:52.830> like

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
up a bit so what I did for things like

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.190 
up a bit so what I did for things like
that<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> made<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> grout<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.600> lot<00:02:54.900> thicker

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
that is I made the grout a lot thicker

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
that is I made the grout a lot thicker
and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.859> went<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.609> thinner<00:02:56.850> brush

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and then I went in with a thinner brush

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.020 
and then I went in with a thinner brush
and<00:02:57.450> try<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> fill<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> gaps<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.810> only<00:03:02.030> few

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and try to fill in the gaps the only few

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.259 
and try to fill in the gaps the only few
problems<00:03:03.570> with<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.519> don't<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:05.940> want

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
problems with it you don't really want

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.560 
problems with it you don't really want
gaps<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.940> cover<00:03:09.120> them<00:03:09.269> too

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
gaps like this but if you cover them too

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.170 
gaps like this but if you cover them too
much<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.260> lose<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.829> definition<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
much you lose the definition in the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.509 
much you lose the definition in the
tiles<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.840> roof<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.829> that's<00:03:14.100> sort<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
tiles on the roof and that's sort of

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.220 
tiles on the roof and that's sort of
what<00:03:14.730> happened<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> bricks<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:16.109> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
what happened with the bricks I think I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
what happened with the bricks I think I
went<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.500> bit<00:03:16.769> too<00:03:17.010> thick<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.970> growl

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
went a little bit too thick with a growl

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.880 
went a little bit too thick with a growl
on<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.690> brick<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.410> you've<00:03:19.590> lost

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
on the brick so you've lost

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.319 
on the brick so you've lost
I've<00:03:20.100> lost<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.430> bit<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.579> definition<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.209> I'm

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
I've lost a bit of definition but I'm

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.460 
I've lost a bit of definition but I'm
hoping<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> go<00:03:22.049> back<00:03:22.320> with<00:03:22.950> paint<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.470> sort

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
hoping to go back with paint and sort

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.330 
hoping to go back with paint and sort
that<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:26.540> before<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.810> paint<00:03:28.560> though<00:03:28.769> I'm<00:03:29.130> gonna

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that out before I paint though I'm gonna

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.430 
that out before I paint though I'm gonna
quickly<00:03:29.640> do<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.359> this<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.810> completely

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
quickly do this and this is completely

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.470 
quickly do this and this is completely
optional<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.400> thought<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.910> would<00:03:33.090> look<00:03:33.209> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
optional but I thought this would look a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.050 
optional but I thought this would look a
little<00:03:34.109> bit<00:03:34.290> nice<00:03:34.799> on<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.370> design<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.970> just

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
little bit nice on my design and just

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.170 
little bit nice on my design and just
add<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.329> little<00:03:36.450> bit<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.700> I'm<00:03:38.700> gonna<00:03:38.850> add

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
add a little bit to it I'm gonna add

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.360 
add a little bit to it I'm gonna add
just<00:03:39.510> around<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.049> chimney<00:03:40.799> area<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:43.280> sort<00:03:44.280> of

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
just around the chimney area a sort of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.970 
just around the chimney area a sort of
plant<00:03:44.790> look<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
plant look like it's going up the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.250 
plant look like it's going up the
chimney<00:03:47.299> if<00:03:48.299> you've<00:03:48.600> ever<00:03:48.780> seen<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> film

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
chimney if you've ever seen the film

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.699 
chimney if you've ever seen the film
tangled<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.400> love<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:51.290> love<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.500> the

doesn't<00:04:33.150> really<00:04:33.330> matter<00:04:33.570> where<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> goes<00:04:34.080> too

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
doesn't really matter where it goes too

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.600 
doesn't really matter where it goes too
much<00:04:34.590> at<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.800> moment<00:04:34.920> because<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.430> like

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
much at the moment because this is like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.010 
much at the moment because this is like
as<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.000> said<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.420> first<00:04:36.720> layer<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:42.020> may

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
as I said like the first layer I may

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.340 
as I said like the first layer I may
make<00:04:43.350> this<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.740> little<00:04:43.950> lighter<00:04:44.900> after<00:04:45.900> this

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
make this a little lighter after this

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.920 
make this a little lighter after this
layer<00:04:46.650> I'm<00:04:47.430> not<00:04:47.610> particularly<00:04:48.060> neat<00:04:48.540> at<00:04:48.810> the

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
layer I'm not particularly neat at the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.190 
layer I'm not particularly neat at the
moment<00:04:49.320> because<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:50.390> still<00:04:51.390> got<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.660> do<00:04:51.810> all<00:04:51.990> the

originally<00:06:07.330> as<00:06:07.690> I<00:06:07.960> said<00:06:08.200> it's<00:06:08.650> gonna<00:06:08.860> be<00:06:09.070> like

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
originally as I said it's gonna be like

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.719 
originally as I said it's gonna be like
a<00:06:09.520> medieval<00:06:10.200> fairytale<00:06:11.200> roof<00:06:11.740> now<00:06:12.040> I<00:06:12.070> did<00:06:12.400> try

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
a medieval fairytale roof now I did try

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.730 
a medieval fairytale roof now I did try
was<00:06:13.030> a<00:06:13.060> more<00:06:13.300> natural<00:06:13.960> look<00:06:14.169> but<00:06:14.410> I<00:06:14.470> didn't

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
was a more natural look but I didn't

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.680 
was a more natural look but I didn't
really<00:06:14.830> like<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:15.669> then<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:16.210> was<00:06:16.570> watching

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
really like it and then I was watching

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.830 
really like it and then I was watching
tangled<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.590> thought<00:06:18.030> purple<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.600> color

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
tangled and I thought purple the color

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.890 
tangled and I thought purple the color
of<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.020> film<00:06:20.350> is<00:06:20.530> purple<00:06:21.100> so<00:06:22.030> this<00:06:22.750> is<00:06:22.870> a

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
of that film is purple so this is a

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.650 
of that film is purple so this is a
first<00:06:23.199> layer<00:06:23.530> of<00:06:23.680> the<00:06:23.860> roof<00:06:24.250> I<00:06:24.610> am<00:06:25.150> gonna<00:06:25.360> add

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
first layer of the roof I am gonna add

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.659 
first layer of the roof I am gonna add
all<00:06:25.930> different<00:06:26.260> shades<00:06:26.410> of<00:06:26.590> purple<00:06:26.800> possibly

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
all different shades of purple possibly

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.450 
all different shades of purple possibly
gray<00:06:28.680> okay<00:06:29.680> so<00:06:29.740> I've<00:06:29.979> added<00:06:30.070> all<00:06:30.340> the

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
gray okay so I've added all the

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.310 
gray okay so I've added all the
different<00:06:30.789> shades<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:31.539> also<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.110> yellow

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
different shades and also the yellow

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200 
different shades and also the yellow
because<00:06:32.950> if<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.280> think<00:06:33.580> about<00:06:33.789> in<00:06:33.910> the<00:06:34.000> film

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
because if you think about in the film

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.830 
because if you think about in the film
there's<00:06:35.080> a<00:06:35.169> lanterns<00:06:35.770> so<00:06:36.700> I'm<00:06:37.330> gonna<00:06:37.510> wait<00:06:37.690> for

that<00:06:37.870> to<00:06:38.050> dry<00:06:38.080> I<00:06:38.289> might<00:06:38.770> add<00:06:38.950> a<00:06:38.979> slightly

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
that to dry I might add a slightly

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.279 
that to dry I might add a slightly
darker<00:06:39.610> color<00:06:40.000> to<00:06:40.090> make<00:06:40.479> the<00:06:40.630> tiles<00:06:40.840> pop<00:06:41.110> out<00:06:41.260> a

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
darker color to make the tiles pop out a

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.589 
darker color to make the tiles pop out a
bit<00:06:41.470> more<00:06:41.620> but<00:06:42.550> now<00:06:42.789> I'm<00:06:43.030> going<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.270> focus<00:06:43.419> my

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
bit more but now I'm going to focus my

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.370 
bit more but now I'm going to focus my
attention<00:06:43.810> on<00:06:44.760> making<00:06:45.760> some<00:06:46.360> plants<00:06:47.110> grow<00:06:47.320> up

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
attention on making some plants grow up

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.750 
attention on making some plants grow up
the<00:06:47.560> side<00:06:49.080> okay<00:06:50.080> so<00:06:50.139> the<00:06:50.889> plants<00:06:51.490> are<00:06:51.610> being

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
the side okay so the plants are being

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.379 
the side okay so the plants are being
added<00:06:52.360> on<00:06:52.530> I've<00:06:53.530> redefined<00:06:54.070> the<00:06:54.610> bricks<00:06:55.090> along

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
the chimney top and I've also colored in

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.629 
the chimney top and I've also colored in
the<00:07:01.900> windows<00:07:02.289> black<00:07:02.650> the<00:07:02.919> ones<00:07:03.099> that<00:07:03.280> don't<00:07:03.490> go

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
the windows black the ones that don't go

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.120 
the windows black the ones that don't go
all<00:07:03.729> the<00:07:03.820> way<00:07:03.849> through<00:07:04.120> I<00:07:04.560> think<00:07:05.560> the<00:07:05.710> next

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
all the way through I think the next

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.540 
all the way through I think the next
step<00:07:06.220> is<00:07:06.639> to<00:07:06.970> do<00:07:07.210> the<00:07:07.240> wooden<00:07:08.220> panels<00:07:09.220> all

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
step is to do the wooden panels all

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.430 
step is to do the wooden panels all
around<00:07:09.910> and<00:07:10.180> I'm<00:07:10.300> gonna<00:07:10.389> do<00:07:10.599> that<00:07:10.630> in<00:07:10.870> a<00:07:10.990> dark

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
around and I'm gonna do that in a dark

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.310 
around and I'm gonna do that in a dark
brown<00:07:11.770> color<00:07:11.830> I<00:07:12.220> think
