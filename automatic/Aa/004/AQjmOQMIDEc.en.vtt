background adds a real depth to the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.490 
background adds a real depth to the
painting<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.360> contrast<00:02:21.080> between

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
painting because of the contrast between

the strong vibrant mid-ground and
