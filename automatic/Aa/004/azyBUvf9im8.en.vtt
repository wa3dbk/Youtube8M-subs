00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that well visuals in a visual sense it's

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.370 
that well visuals in a visual sense it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
good but it could have been better

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.170 
good but it could have been better
especially<00:02:28.769> considering<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.849> this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
especially considering that this is a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.210 
especially considering that this is a
Steven<00:02:30.510> Spielberg<00:02:30.630> movie<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:31.440> at<00:02:31.739> least<00:02:31.950> a

Steven Spielberg helmed series but if

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.690 
Steven Spielberg helmed series but if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
Jurassic Park film in here would get a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
Jurassic Park film in here would get a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
four out of five from me and the fact

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.720 
four out of five from me and the fact
that<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.569> look<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:49.099> very<00:02:50.099> very<00:02:50.400> detailed

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that they look good very very detailed

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.789 
that they look good very very detailed
especially<00:02:51.510> within<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.139> first<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.560> when<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
especially within the first one when the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.680 
especially within the first one when the
first<00:02:52.950> Brachiosaurus<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.819> brought<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.359> and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
first Brachiosaurus is brought up and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.170 
first Brachiosaurus is brought up and
during<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> whole<00:02:55.650> majestic<00:02:56.519> sequence<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
during the whole majestic sequence and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.330 
during the whole majestic sequence and
everything<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> everything<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.920> crystal

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
everything and everything is crystal

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.059 
everything and everything is crystal
clear<00:02:59.880> everything<00:03:00.690> looks<00:03:00.989> great<00:03:01.230> colors<00:03:01.859> are

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
clear everything looks great colors are

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.150 
clear everything looks great colors are
vibrant<00:03:02.750> only<00:03:03.750> problem<00:03:04.319> though<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:04.859> it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
vibrant only problem though is that it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.809 
vibrant only problem though is that it
has<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.850> three<00:03:06.920> movies<00:03:07.920> have<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> very

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
has a all three movies have a very

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.789 
has a all three movies have a very
noticeable<00:03:09.569> amount<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.049> edge<00:03:10.139> enhancement

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
noticeable amount of edge enhancement

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.099 
noticeable amount of edge enhancement
which<00:03:11.040> does<00:03:11.730> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.120> dock<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.510> score<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
which does kind of dock the score just a

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.199 
which does kind of dock the score just a
little<00:03:13.380> bit<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.769> thus<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> causes<00:03:14.700> haloing

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
little bit and thus it causes haloing

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.129 
little bit and thus it causes haloing
and<00:03:15.450> blah<00:03:15.630> blah<00:03:15.660> blah

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
and blah blah blah

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.710 
and blah blah blah
but<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:17.010> mean<00:03:17.190> most<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.030> visual<00:03:18.420> files

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
but I mean most you know visual files

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.390 
but I mean most you know visual files
you<00:03:19.410> know<00:03:19.560> will<00:03:19.739> feel<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:20.069> bit<00:03:20.220> bad

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you know will feel a little bit bad

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.650 
you know will feel a little bit bad
about<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:21.560> color<00:03:22.730> timing<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.420> said<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
about this color timing like I said the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.090 
about this color timing like I said the
color<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:25.019> great<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.500> color<00:03:25.680> timing<00:03:26.040> is

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
color is great but the color timing is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.949 
color is great but the color timing is
just<00:03:26.310> sometimes<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.690> bit<00:03:27.780> off

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
just sometimes it's a little bit off

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.699 
just sometimes it's a little bit off
occasionally<00:03:28.549> but<00:03:29.549> however<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.500> very

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
occasionally but however it's a very

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.370 
occasionally but however it's a very
good<00:03:31.950> jump<00:03:32.250> from<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.609> DVDs<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:34.109> could

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
good jump from the DVDs but it could

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.150 
good jump from the DVDs but it could
have<00:03:34.470> been<00:03:34.560> much<00:03:34.709> better<00:03:34.769> especially

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
have been much better especially

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.640 
have been much better especially
considering<00:03:36.030> how<00:03:36.239> how<00:03:36.870> good<00:03:37.139> Steven

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
considering how how good Steven

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.839 
considering how how good Steven
Spielberg's<00:03:38.040> movies<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.459> been<00:03:38.519> brought<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
Spielberg's movies have been brought to

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.699 
Spielberg's movies have been brought to
blu-ray<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:40.410> kind<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
blu-ray and so it's kind of a

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.020 
blu-ray and so it's kind of a
disappointment<00:03:40.829> with<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.459> regard<00:03:41.819> but

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
disappointment with that regard but

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.280 
disappointment with that regard but
could<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.480> been<00:03:42.540> worse<00:03:42.780> since<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.200> is

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
could have been worse since it is

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.110 
could have been worse since it is

I mean lack of common I mean it is

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.790 
I mean lack of common I mean it is
typical<00:07:04.870> Spielberg<00:07:05.380> but<00:07:05.560> the<00:07:05.650> lack<00:07:05.770> of

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
typical Spielberg but the lack of

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.290 
typical Spielberg but the lack of
commentary<00:07:06.220> really<00:07:06.639> does<00:07:06.789> kind<00:07:06.940> of<00:07:07.030> hurt<00:07:07.180> a

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
commentary really does kind of hurt a

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.330 
commentary really does kind of hurt a
little<00:07:07.419> bit<00:07:07.630> so<00:07:07.990> but<00:07:08.470> you're<00:07:09.070> a<00:07:09.099> fan<00:07:09.310> of

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
little bit so but you're a fan of
