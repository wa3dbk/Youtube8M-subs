00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.000
 michel and joão canabrava on the flame blog 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.310
 futilities 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 I write the double planet blog lives in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 São Paulo is the meat 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 I live here on the river we talk a lot 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.779
 beauty fashion behavior 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.510
 I think I really split between the three 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.460
 categories like travel speaks of health 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.460
 but these are the main 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:51.110
 Your daily cleaning routine is 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.800
 clean toning and moisturize 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.520
 or you jumped in that space in the states and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.140
 Ominous morning to the face with a soap 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.330
 and after passing direct protector of 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.010
 neighborhood that normally have occurred 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.230
 Night idea I have a little bit more 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.260
 of time but I do not have an intimacy 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.210
 because the other three do not understand this 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.220
 Intimacy she has come from a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 Do you realize that this routine behind 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.360
 benefits is always like this 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.100
 there is one thing that we 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.410
 Sometimes it's because of the time on the run. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.660
 is actually skipping the steps you do not 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.000
 It's a lot but it's interesting people. 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.570
 realize that each step has its value 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.800
 and it should be made for us to remember the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.050
 that was said before 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.330
 the first step of cleansing the skin is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.430
 really with a liquid soap 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.650
 specific for the face that will do 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.479
 all the cleaning as it should be done 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.230
 After cleaning, we'll go to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.450
 The second step reminds you of any good 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.770
 people will qualify the skin and for that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.130
 we will use the astringent lotion 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.590
 for eyebrows in a well manner 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.659
 similar to put a cotton one 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.820
 people are also small. 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.430
 times they have a misconception that how much 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.610
 The more you put on the skin, the more you get 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.409
 strip your skin will actually expel 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.929
 an amount that is not interesting 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.489
 for her we really only put one 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.560
 little cotton and with the stick only you 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.930
 You can also get across the face. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.830
 clear circular movement and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.830
 always upward 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.790
 Now we go to the third one. 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.600
 step we will moisturize the skin is always 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 cleaning toning and moisturizing this 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.230
 part that I'm always afraid of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.960
 because on oily skin then there is always 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.060
 that in fear of datta it 's just you 're a 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.410
 doubt that many people have when the skin 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.570
 very oily 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.610
 we are afraid to put any 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.620
 hydration because the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 people confuse water and oil 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 but everyone knows that they do not if they 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.760
 they do not mix, it's not for us then 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.150
 maintain a healthy and independent skin 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.020
 whether or not it is oily and moisturizing is 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.810
 for all 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.760
 Okay, let's not confuse water with doctors. 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.520
 Ideally, in the day to day you do 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.680
 this skin cleansing routine at the greatest 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.010
 comfort you can achieve 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.930
 here is talking about daily care 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.120
 are the basic steps really 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.739
 You have to have caring and care. 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.620
 with the skin on a daily basis 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.150
 For this, if we complete, we come with 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.730
 protection factor 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.310
 only on the market today there are several 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.320
 how you can protect your 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.180
 skin and squad eyebrow folks 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.430
 worried about this too so I 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.630
 with when you do what I do 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.640
 you normally use the base that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.040
 you use in your hematologist 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.350
 usually do not leave me to the base one 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 because normally the bases 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.750
 as to the interpretation with the minor factor 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.060
 that 30 and 31 is the minimum for her then 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.690
 which can then in general I use a 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.290
 30 separate protector spreads with taste 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.260
 and then of a base or an orchard so 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.840
 in one of two things is one after the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.030
 two products eurail nifty 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.549
 in your case we have a product 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.660
 perfect for this he is already a 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.299
 The toner with protection factor 30 is 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.310
 exactly one people talks a lot in factor 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.579
 protection in cosmetics because 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.310
 for this light detran 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.770
 is not in the direct light of exposure to the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.000
 sun factor 30 it actually meets the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.490
 your needs 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.889
 we have this factor not only in this 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.870
 presentation with toner without 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.370
 toner and also in powder 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.740
 so you can rest easy to 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.909
 choose how to protect yourself and 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.710
 still beautiful 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.159
 It's good now, here I am going to show you 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.139
 so this is the pop of the line my day 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.349

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.629
 simple 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.629
 even so popular 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.540
 most products with a high 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.060
 protection factor of 30 so far 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.580
 market is sometimes very 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.600
 they are denser and mainly 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.700
 pro dust 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.500
 it is usually heavier or 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.169
 be the finish so finished 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.900
 a party but it has a lot of 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.540
 over night exactly that here not 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.919
 it has - just as in the composition it is 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.500
 one of the components that leaves 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.260
 extremely matt appearance 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.389
 bit heavier with it you can not 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.090
 apply with the brush it holds 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:44.229
 lightness of skin but lets protect 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.620
 That's cool, we 're already with the

 You will end up no longer skipping any 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.800
 step and will include the astringent lotion 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.590

 rast of pleasure and hope that we get
