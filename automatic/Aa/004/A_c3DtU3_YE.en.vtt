00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.420 
going on there to some type of bondage
between<00:00:50.670> these<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> yeah<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> mean<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
between these two and yeah I mean it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
between these two and yeah I mean it
literally<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.149> says<00:00:54.360> guess<00:00:54.690> who<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
something written on his cap although

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
something written on his cap although
i'm<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.879> sure<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.890> looks<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.039> wood

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
i'm not sure what it is looks like wood

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
i'm not sure what it is looks like wood
to<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:03.989> brighten

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to me now but if you actually brighten

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.299 
to me now but if you actually brighten
it<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> number

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it up you can see that there's a number

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.690 
it up you can see that there's a number
10<00:01:06.710> guess<00:01:07.710> who<00:01:09.229> honestly<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:11.340> even<00:01:11.520> know

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
10 guess who honestly I don't even know

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
10 guess who honestly I don't even know
why<00:01:11.850> balloon<00:01:12.210> boy<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.450> even<00:01:12.810> being<00:01:12.990> introduced

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
why balloon boy is even being introduced

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
why balloon boy is even being introduced
even<00:01:14.070> further<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> story<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.360> guess<00:01:15.960> he

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
even further in the story I guess he

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
even further in the story I guess he
actually<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.950> important<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> lot<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
actually is more important than a lot of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
actually is more important than a lot of
people<00:01:18.090> thought<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> people

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
people thought because a lot of people

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.170 
people thought because a lot of people
just<00:01:20.009> thought<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> he<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> proper

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
just thought that he was like a proper

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
just thought that he was like a proper
like<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.659> extra<00:01:21.930> animatronic<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
like an extra animatronic that was just

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
like an extra animatronic that was just
added<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.030> help<00:01:24.450> foxy<00:01:25.170> attack<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
added there to help foxy attack you you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
added there to help foxy attack you you
know<00:01:26.150> when<00:01:27.150> he<00:01:27.360> enters<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.900> air<00:01:28.110> vent<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
know when he enters your air vent and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
know when he enters your air vent and
you<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.890> let<00:01:29.070> him<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:30.030> accident<00:01:30.210> because

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you just let him in by accident because

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
you just let him in by accident because
you're<00:01:30.840> too<00:01:30.960> busy<00:01:30.990> focusing<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.799> everyone

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you're too busy focusing on everyone

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're too busy focusing on everyone
else<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.240> apparently<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.720> he<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> greater

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
else so apparently now he has a greater

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.219 
else so apparently now he has a greater
purpose<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> story<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.810> guess<00:01:36.990> God's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
purpose in the story and I guess God's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
purpose in the story and I guess God's
gonna<00:01:37.380> give<00:01:37.799> us<00:01:37.950> even<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.220> background<00:01:38.610> on

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
gonna give us even more background on

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
gonna give us even more background on
him<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.240> five<00:01:39.479> nights<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.810> Freddy's<00:01:40.079> 3<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
him in five nights at Freddy's 3 you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.469 
him in five nights at Freddy's 3 you
know<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.430> cool<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.820> balloon

he<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.240> people<00:01:48.810> thought<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> was<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
he does people thought it was a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
he does people thought it was a
hallucination<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> confirmed<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
hallucination but that confirmed that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
hallucination but that confirmed that
he's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> toy

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
he's not now because he was in the toy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310 
he's not now because he was in the toy
box<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.240> broken<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.990> everyone

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
box that was broken down with everyone

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.149 
box that was broken down with everyone
else<00:01:55.500> um<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:58.140> else<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.920> yeah<00:01:59.130> I

backs or in this kid if you want to call

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
backs or in this kid if you want to call
it<00:02:03.740> because<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> mean<00:02:05.280> seriously<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.700> don't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it because I mean seriously we don't

it because I mean seriously we don't
even<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.350> what's<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> point<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> immune

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
even know what's the point of immune

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.229 
even know what's the point of immune
being<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> marionettes

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
being in there you know the marionettes

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
being in there you know the marionettes
there<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> wise<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
know he gave life to the animatronics

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.730 
know he gave life to the animatronics
but<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> only<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.170> really<00:02:14.410> don't<00:02:14.530> know

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
but the only one we really don't know

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.620 
but the only one we really don't know
why<00:02:15.520> isn't<00:02:15.850> there<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> balloon<00:02:16.270> boy<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
why isn't there is a balloon boy you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.940 
why isn't there is a balloon boy you
know<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.020> actually<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.470> one<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
know this is actually the one of the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.280 
know this is actually the one of the
most<00:02:18.580> secretive<00:02:19.030> animatronics<00:02:19.900> out<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.140> them

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
most secretive animatronics out of them

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.500 
most secretive animatronics out of them
all<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.700> guess<00:02:21.850> now<00:02:21.970> we're<00:02:22.090> gonna<00:02:22.180> figure

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
all see I guess now we're gonna figure

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.910 
all see I guess now we're gonna figure
out<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:22.960> more<00:02:23.160> above<00:02:24.160> balloon<00:02:24.460> boy<00:02:25.920> but

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
out a bit more above balloon boy but

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.460 
out a bit more above balloon boy but
guess<00:02:27.250> who<00:02:27.930> there's<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.140> number<00:02:29.410> 10<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.950> their

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
guess who there's a number 10 in their

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.240 
guess who there's a number 10 in their
march<00:02:32.470> 10th<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.810> we're<00:02:35.650> gonna<00:02:35.740> start<00:02:36.010> some

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
march 10th really we're gonna start some

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.060 
march 10th really we're gonna start some
more<00:02:36.750> release<00:02:37.750> date<00:02:38.020> theories<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.740> large

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
more release date theories with large

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.540 
more release date theories with large
tent<00:02:39.490> cuz<00:02:39.760> there's<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.000> 10<00:02:40.330> there<00:02:40.360> oh<00:02:40.870> my<00:02:41.260> god<00:02:41.590> no

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
tent cuz there's a 10 there oh my god no

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.520 
tent cuz there's a 10 there oh my god no
dude<00:02:43.300> no<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> bad<00:02:45.490> idea<00:02:46.200> why<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.260> there

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
dude no this is a bad idea why is there

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
dude no this is a bad idea why is there
a<00:02:47.560> 10<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.930> no<00:02:50.260> point<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:51.010> there<00:02:51.160> being<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
a 10 there's no point for there being a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590 
a 10 there's no point for there being a
10-10<00:02:52.840> animatronics<00:02:53.740> 10<00:02:54.550> cameras<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.420> don't

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
10-10 animatronics 10 cameras I don't

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.330 
10-10 animatronics 10 cameras I don't
know<00:02:55.660> that's<00:02:56.140> probably<00:02:56.350> all<00:02:56.530> debunk<00:02:57.070> able

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
know that's probably all debunk able

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.030 
know that's probably all debunk able
really<00:02:57.700> quickly<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.990> it's<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.590> much

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
really quickly because it's just so much

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.370 
really quickly because it's just so much
other<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:01.270> know<00:03:01.300> evidence<00:03:01.840> floating<00:03:02.290> around

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
other you know evidence floating around

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.690 
other you know evidence floating around
that<00:03:02.890> Scott<00:03:03.490> did<00:03:03.880> himself<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:05.110> again<00:03:05.700> Scott

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
that Scott did himself but again Scott

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.910 
that Scott did himself but again Scott
is<00:03:06.880> tricky<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.630> what<00:03:08.050> he<00:03:08.140> says<00:03:08.410> isn't<00:03:08.620> always

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
is tricky and what he says isn't always

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.330 
is tricky and what he says isn't always
what<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.340> seems<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.090> again<00:03:10.480> here<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:10.840> go<00:03:11.340> more

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
what it seems so again here we go more

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.240 
what it seems so again here we go more
confusion<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.440> games<00:03:14.650> coming<00:03:14.890> out<00:03:15.010> soon

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
confusion but the games coming out soon

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.090 
confusion but the games coming out soon
probably<00:03:15.640> maybe<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.390> mean<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.960> did<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.350> predicted

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
probably maybe I mean I did I predicted

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.340 
probably maybe I mean I did I predicted
myself<00:03:18.430> two<00:03:18.580> weeks<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:19.810> isn't<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.170> time

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
myself two weeks that isn't the time

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.080 
myself two weeks that isn't the time
frame<00:03:20.650> between<00:03:20.770> March<00:03:21.220> 10th<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.060> go

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
frame between March 10th so here we go

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.410 
frame between March 10th so here we go
again<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.470> ya<00:03:26.620> gonna<00:03:27.400> be<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.610> lot<00:03:27.790> more<00:03:27.850> theories

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
again so ya gonna be a lot more theories

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.240 
again so ya gonna be a lot more theories
now<00:03:28.570> because<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.320> mean<00:03:29.500> balloon<00:03:30.040> boys

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
now because of this I mean balloon boys

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.370 
now because of this I mean balloon boys
in<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.760> no<00:03:31.720> reason<00:03:32.110> whatsoever<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:34.230> guess<00:03:35.230> he

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
in here no reason whatsoever I guess he

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
in here no reason whatsoever I guess he
really<00:03:35.560> does<00:03:35.860> play<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> greater<00:03:36.430> role<00:03:36.520> in<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
really does play a greater role in the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.450 
really does play a greater role in the
five<00:03:37.090> nights<00:03:37.270> at<00:03:37.390> Freddy's<00:03:37.660> story<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:39.250> guess

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
five nights at Freddy's story but guess

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.610 
five nights at Freddy's story but guess
who<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:40.000> mean<00:03:40.450> what<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:40.960> is<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.410> just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
who I mean what is just is that just

who I mean what is just is that just
signifying<00:03:42.100> balloon<00:03:42.460> boy<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.790> guess<00:03:43.090> who<00:03:43.240> bloom

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
signifying balloon boy I guess who bloom

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.910 
signifying balloon boy I guess who bloom
boy<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.290> know<00:03:44.380> he's<00:03:44.590> always<00:03:44.710> saying<00:03:44.980> hi
