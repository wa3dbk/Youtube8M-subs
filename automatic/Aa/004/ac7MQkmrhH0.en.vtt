 They are the vacuum machine 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.840
 and the runner 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.340
 we will start preparing a mixture to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.010
 Ingredients base for seasoning 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.350

 On the other hand, we will start working with 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.570
 the chorizo ​​steak that we will cook 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.120
 empty 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.330
 we will cut steaks of 2 to 3 centimeters 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.330
 width 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.310

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.920
 seasoning we have the meat with the mixture 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 what we did previously 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.000
 we must clean the interior so that the 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.000
 air does not escape during sealing 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.930
 then we will prepare the machine 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.740
 of emptiness 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.810
 we will put the meat inside 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.860
 to give as the edges where 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.860
 will make the seal 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.500
 and we will regulate the amount of vacuum that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.170
 we want to exercise on the product 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.200
 When working with meats, the greatest 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.780
 empty possible we will choose the time of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.630
 sealed we will close the lid of the machine 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.580
 to start the process the machine 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.850
 will remove air from the bag and the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.850
 sealed 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.250
 in this way we will get the meat 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.739
 vacuum packed 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.069
 then we will work with a 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.069
 roller 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.069
 we will do a basic base cooking 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.370
 we must ensure that the seal 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 the meat is the right one 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.070
 we will put the meat under vacuum inside the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.340
 container with water at temperature 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.340
 desired 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.740
 as we will see the meat in repeated 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.120
 occasions to prevent it from being modified 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.120
 the temperature around him 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.650

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.410
 indoor juices 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.150
 Y 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.620
 Y 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.350
 in this way we can see that the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.480
 cooking was totally even 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.480
 then we will seal the meat 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.319
 we will put oil in a Teflon pan 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.830
 and we will cook for 30 seconds of 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.830
 each side 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.889
 once the desired point has been obtained 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.050
 we will reserve 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.689
 on the other hand we will prepare the juice of 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.689
 vegetables we will cut onions into wedges 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.120
 Y 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.090
 in a baking dish we will put the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.970

 180 degree oven for 20 minutes 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.770
 after this period we will cover the source 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.770
 with self-adhesive plastic 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.009
 and we will continue cooking during the steam 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.419
 20 more minutes 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.419
 we will remove the plastic 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.510
 we will recover the juices of the vegetables 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.510
 using a Chinese strainer with filter 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.120
 in this way we will obtain the juice of 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:21.650
 vegetable oil fry finally 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.650
 the pores cut in juliana 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.150
 we will carry out this process on a gentle fire 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.419
 until the cigars stop detaching 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.419
 Water 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.860
 finished this process we will go to 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.760
 to season seasoning we have the juice of 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.760
 vegetables with salt 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.180

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.480
 we will put the meat 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.950
 and to finish we will decorate with the 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.950
