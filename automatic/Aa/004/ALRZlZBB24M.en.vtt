superlatives we'll make a really long
highlight<00:00:59.430> video<00:00:59.730> we'll<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> biggest

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
highlight video we'll get the biggest

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.340 
highlight video we'll get the biggest
baddest<00:01:01.710> spring<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.690> can't<00:01:03.960> worry<00:01:04.260> about

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
baddest spring but we can't worry about

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.190 
baddest spring but we can't worry about
the<00:01:04.739> superlatives<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the superlatives right now we have to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.520 
the superlatives right now we have to
figure<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.560> what's<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> next<00:01:08.880> test<00:01:09.150> oh

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
figure out what's on the next test oh

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
figure out what's on the next test oh
just<00:01:10.530> stop<00:01:10.740> being<00:01:10.979> happy<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> sweet<00:01:12.330> 16

we<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.290> past<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> you've<00:01:13.860> been

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
we have to get past and you've been

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280 
we have to get past and you've been

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
there for three years in a row so we

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
there for three years in a row so we
have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.680> past<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> hump<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.670> think

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
have to get past that hump I think

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
have to get past that hump I think
Marquette<00:01:18.900> will<00:01:19.110> second<00:01:19.500> half<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.130> first

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Marquette will second half the first

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
half we come out strong for the first

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920 
half we come out strong for the first
four<00:01:22.320> minutes<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.159> let<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.030> second

basically and we come out strong second
half<00:01:29.570> that's<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.720> bootcamp<00:01:31.110> come<00:01:31.380> out

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
half that's when the bootcamp come out

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
half that's when the bootcamp come out
and<00:01:31.650> us<00:01:31.799> each<00:01:32.759> year<00:01:32.939> we've<00:01:33.090> been<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> 36<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and us each year we've been to a 36 and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.810 
and us each year we've been to a 36 and
we<00:01:33.869> lost<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.420> lost<00:01:36.420> by<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
we lost and lost by a lot of that that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
we lost and lost by a lot of that that
yeah<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.329> any<00:01:39.720> year<00:01:39.900> before<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.439> Kailen

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
yeah and any year before you know Kailen

but uh really saying was you get the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.090 
but uh really saying was you get the
same<00:01:42.990> test<00:01:43.229> over<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:43.619> again<00:01:43.770> until<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
same test over and over again until you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
same test over and over again until you
passes<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.729> we're<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.750> again<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> time

passes so we're here again and this time

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
passes so we're here again and this time
hopefully<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.340> past<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.850> know

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
hopefully we can get past you know

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
hopefully we can get past you know
advanced<00:01:48.600> towards<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> loop<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> later<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
advanced towards the loop you later I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
advanced towards the loop you later I
mean<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> played<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> lot<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.030> year<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
mean I played a lot more this year so I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
mean I played a lot more this year so I
mean<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.460> help<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> team<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
mean I think I can help the team up a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
mean I think I can help the team up a
little<00:01:54.479> bit<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:54.720> defensive<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
little bit more defensive and just you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.730 
little bit more defensive and just you
know<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.100> doing<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.689> asked<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
know just doing what I'm asked to do so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.980 
know just doing what I'm asked to do so
hopefully<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.780> draw

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
hopefully you know we get a good draw

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.670 
hopefully you know we get a good draw
and<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.130> take<00:02:02.280> care<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.520> business
