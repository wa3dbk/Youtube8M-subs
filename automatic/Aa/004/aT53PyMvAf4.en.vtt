00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
one hundred and ten

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.339 
one hundred and ten
so<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> voltage<00:02:08.399> does<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.729> decrease<00:02:09.349> all

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
so the voltage does not decrease all

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.800 
so the voltage does not decrease all
I've<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.679> done<00:02:11.220> has<00:02:11.880> effectively<00:02:12.300> slowed

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
I've really done has effectively slowed

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.380 
I've really done has effectively slowed
down<00:02:13.080> my<00:02:13.110> motor<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:14.069> my<00:02:14.250> meter<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.310> made<00:02:18.269> it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
down my motor or my meter and made it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.130 
down my motor or my meter and made it
more<00:02:18.540> efficient

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
more efficient

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.720 
more efficient
thereby<00:02:19.560> reducing<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> amount<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.580> power

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
thereby reducing the amount of power

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.110 
thereby reducing the amount of power
that<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> needs<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:22.400> effective<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> run

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that it needs to be effective and run

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.660 
that it needs to be effective and run
