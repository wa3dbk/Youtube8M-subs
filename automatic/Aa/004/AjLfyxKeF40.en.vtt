the<00:00:25.779> other<00:00:25.930> day<00:00:26.369> attempting<00:00:27.369> to<00:00:27.490> use<00:00:27.669> it<00:00:27.820> as<00:00:27.939> a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
the other day attempting to use it as a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.750 
the other day attempting to use it as a
slide<00:00:28.480> it<00:00:29.350> would<00:00:29.590> have<00:00:29.740> an<00:00:29.859> arc<00:00:30.100> but<00:00:30.430> I<00:00:30.460> don't

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
slide it would have an arc but I don't

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.670 
slide it would have an arc but I don't
think<00:00:31.029> anyone<00:00:31.420> would<00:00:31.630> notice<00:00:31.689> that<00:00:32.110> well

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
think anyone would notice that well

maybe<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.190> wouldn't<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.840> I<00:00:34.870> was<00:00:35.080> shooting

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
maybe you wouldn't what I was shooting

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.040 
maybe you wouldn't what I was shooting
was<00:00:35.559> only<00:00:35.830> about<00:00:36.040> 18<00:00:36.670> inches<00:00:36.910> off<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.269> ground

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050

an<00:00:38.170> old<00:00:38.470> skater<00:00:38.890> don't<00:00:39.220> like<00:00:39.519> to<00:00:39.730> get<00:00:39.910> down<00:00:40.210> low

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
an old skater don't like to get down low

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.780 
an old skater don't like to get down low
so<00:00:40.900> pull<00:00:41.140> them<00:00:41.260> focus<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.860> was<00:00:42.340> going<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.640> be<00:00:42.760> a

focus from close up to infinity that's

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.640 
focus from close up to infinity that's
nice<00:00:57.220> I<00:00:57.510> decided<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.690> use<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.839> tape<00:00:59.140> measure<00:00:59.170> to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
pull focus this is the way I used to do

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.450 
pull focus this is the way I used to do
it<00:01:02.920> back<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.369> day<00:01:03.610> before<00:01:03.850> SLR<00:01:04.659> cameras<00:01:05.140> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it back in the day before SLR cameras I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.190 
it back in the day before SLR cameras I
grab<00:01:06.460> my<00:01:06.610> trusty<00:01:06.820> tape<00:01:07.150> measure<00:01:07.479> starting

shots using the measurement system and
it<00:02:22.300> always<00:02:22.480> came<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.410> good<00:02:23.680> sharp<00:02:24.190> focus

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
