00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello everyone I'm Felix Perez and today I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.480
 I bring another commented gameplay is a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 gameplay of the game that had long been 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.869
 it was not up it's about marvel vs capcom 3 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.540
 and because it's gameplay lewis 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.500
 nothing less than to tell you about a 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.380
 movie that has been released 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.200
 recently I speak of course of the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.850
 Avengers and good that better game for 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.490
 tell you about the avengers that is marvel 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.870
 vs capcom 3 as you see the characters that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 I have on my team are the captain 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.719
 america hulk that just entered and that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 has been loaded to river with a single punch 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 and ironman those are my avengers 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.620
 favorites in the movie all the truth 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 is that I've never liked that that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.739
 rather they have included a god like 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.569
 Superhero, I really do not like it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.059
 futurmoda because it's like a god but not 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:58.679
 stop being a man a human being but 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.839
 The whole truth is that it is one of the 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.710
 most powerful marvel characters and is 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.979
 simply because he is a god 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 and nothing because they are about three 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.470
 arcade mode games and well you'll see 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.450
 that are appearing the two bad guys are 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.940
 the villains and this time I'm fighting 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.970
 with iron man and I get an attack 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.590
 powerful gets half bar removed 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.180
 to the super skrull and nothing because I wanted 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.159
 tell me about the movie that is a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.780
 movie that has surprised me that the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.310
 that you follow my channel you will know that I do not 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.580
 I had many expectations in this 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.190
 movie I already told you in the x-men video 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.700
 origins wolfhound believed it was a 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 purely commercial movie the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.890
 truth is that the movies of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 superheroes do not usually leave quality 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 I think the only films of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.590
 superheroes apart from the batman that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.960
 they are saved 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.259
 those of x-men are a good franchise 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.719
 superheroes those of spiderman for good 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.179
 comply with a tell you the story of 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.250
 spiderman although now it's going to be released 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.210
 a spiderman reboot that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 will focus much more action history 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.230
 adult with a much more serious plot 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.970
 even dramatic talking about the agony 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.770
 of Peter's sadness for not having 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.730
 known to his parents and for knowing his 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.209
 past 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.129
 and after that the movies of 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.010
 Superheroes do not usually come out very well 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.459
 stops at the movies and they tend to be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.260
 films of low quality or not 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.090
 they comply with the argument they follow us 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.459
 many times the argument of the comics 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.480
 they go through the lining but this time 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.720
 with the avengers we find ourselves with 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.790
 the supreme work of the superheroes I 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.079
 I swear I had never seen a movie in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.629
 Superheros 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.780
 except batman who no longer considers 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.970
 a movie of superheroes but and good 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.549
 batman living to the best yes that continues 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
 the aesthetics of superhero movies 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.280
 counting the origin fighting against 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.420
 villain teaching us the skills of 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.880
 every hero and such 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.459
 and go back in and destroy the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.150
 sentinel but nothing has been speaking 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 because otherwise I will not finish commenting 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.530
 the movie just wanted to make a 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.430
 small review and a recommendation is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.430
 a movie that has surprised me 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.690
 It has a lot of quality is very 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.360
 worked has many winks and many 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.460
 gags to comic book lovers and it's also 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.740
 Entertaining and has a lot of action and humor 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.660
 for those who do not know the 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.660
 characters and just want 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.710
 good to know they are very characters 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.380
 charismatic your relationship is very alive 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.330
 on the screen the complication of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.250
 Avengers was that to see so many 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.380
 charismatic characters and on screen 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.020
 because someone is eclipsed and did not have 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.570
 enough prominence it is true that the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.630
 movie 'the ones that give the touch of 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.940
 humor are ironman and for his monkey though 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.220
 do not believe it hulk gives a touch of 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.540
 pretty good mood in the movie but 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.420
 all the characters have a 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.160
 very good interpretation the cast is 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.680
 excellent and follows the same pattern of 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.330
 previous films tell us things 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.130
 what had happened in all the things that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.130
 had happened in the captain's movie 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.710
 america the first avenger 'tell us 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.860
 a little more about the barn eye that is 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.970
 an avenger that is good is an agent 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.830
 say that he joins and nothing is a movie 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.490
 good is a spectacular movie full 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.560
 of action with many comic moments 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.450
 good is what the movies of 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.849
 marvel who always try to give him the 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.009
 set that humorous 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.839
 and not that absurd humor of the movies 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.539
 of transformers that are easy jokes 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:57.909
 or characters taken from the mind of a 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.860
 sick no, that's not jokes 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.740
 many smart are orchestrated 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.409
 by port all starr by iron man gives you a 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.080
 very funny touch to the movie has a 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.059
 plot quite achieved not very 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.339
 complex to the movies of 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:16.699
 superheroes with more complex plots 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:19.770
 they could be in watchmen 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.710
 even dark hair although it's not a 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.520
 plot difficult to follow but it is a 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.590
 plot that meets the villain is pretty 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.120
 pretty pathetic if not silly 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.889
 but what is discovered at the end of the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.650
 movie is that everything was castrated by 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.139
 plus another villain I will not reveal 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.759
 nothing if you are lovers of comics but 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.100
 I recommend that you go to see her that is worth 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.139
 It's very worthwhile that it surprises and that 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.770
 you will go from fucking mother see you in the 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.770
 next video
