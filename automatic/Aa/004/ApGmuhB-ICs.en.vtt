00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
we didn't put one in I think originally

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.640 
we didn't put one in I think originally
it<00:02:51.870> had<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.799> tube<00:02:53.099> TV<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.260> didn't<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
it had a tube TV and we didn't do that I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.679 
it had a tube TV and we didn't do that I
think<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.159> best<00:02:56.370> route<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:56.909> this<00:02:57.120> point<00:02:57.480> would

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
think the best route at this point would

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.750 
think the best route at this point would
be<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.989> come<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.590> maybe<00:02:58.739> put<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> flat<00:02:59.400> panel

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
be to come in and maybe put a flat panel

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.879 
be to come in and maybe put a flat panel
over<00:03:00.180> top<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.709> definitely

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
over top I think that would definitely

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.910 
over top I think that would definitely
be<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> best<00:03:02.939> route<00:03:03.209> back<00:03:04.109> here<00:03:04.469> you've<00:03:04.650> got<00:03:04.889> a
