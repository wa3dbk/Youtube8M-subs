00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 off on vacation at hamburger airport 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 reigns high-powered suitcase 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 Grab it and go but there is a lot to it 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.250
 note 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.450
 Every airline now has its own 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.430
 Excess baggage can be expensive 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.829
 therefore absolutely before departure 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 inform the most important is first 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.410
 once again to see what tariff 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.630
 I booked 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 hand luggage the most important thing is still 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.859
 once to inquire how many kilos allowed 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.179

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.760

 Luggage must be given separately 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.070

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.970
