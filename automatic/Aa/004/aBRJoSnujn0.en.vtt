00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
gentlemen this is a promenade step and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.250 
gentlemen this is a promenade step and
so<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.719> moving<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> your

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so you're going to be moving to your

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.450 
so you're going to be moving to your
left<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.770> instead<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.430> through

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
left but instead of going through

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.540 
left but instead of going through
forward<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> did<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.719> your<00:00:42.750> first<00:00:43.140> step

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
forward like you did on your first step

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.709 
forward like you did on your first step
we're<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.090> backwards<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
we're going to be going backwards and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.209 
we're going to be going backwards and
the<00:00:45.780> reason<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.649> both<00:00:46.860> try<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the reason is because if we both try and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.440 
the reason is because if we both try and
go<00:00:47.280> forward<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> try<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.030> lead<00:00:48.149> her<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> go

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
go forward you try and lead her to go

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
go forward you try and lead her to go
underneath<00:00:48.719> we're<00:00:49.350> both<00:00:49.620> trying<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> go

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
underneath we're both trying to go

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
underneath we're both trying to go
through<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> same<00:00:50.640> opening<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.149> same

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
through the same opening at the same

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.850 
through the same opening at the same
time<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.350> enough<00:00:52.410> room

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
time and there's really not enough room

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
time and there's really not enough room
so<00:00:53.120> we're<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> take<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:54.660> steps

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so we're going to take our steps

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
so we're going to take our steps
backwards<00:00:55.680> instead<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> forward<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
backwards instead of forward and that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
backwards instead of forward and that
way<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> lady<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.570> lots<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.050> room<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> go

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
way the lady has lots of room to go

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
way the lady has lots of room to go
underneath<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> makes<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.489> nicer

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
underneath and it makes them much nicer

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
underneath and it makes them much nicer
appearance<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.840> let's<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
appearance so let's go over that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349
