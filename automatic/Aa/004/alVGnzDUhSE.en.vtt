CFG then you want to open up your

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.319 
CFG then you want to open up your
autoexec<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:35.969> type<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.050> shown

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
autoexec and type this in as it shown

just as highlighted part right here
notice<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> bindings<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.190> just

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
notice the bindings right here you just

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.619 
notice the bindings right here you just
want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> change<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.149> whatever<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

you<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.469> game<00:00:46.730> for<00:00:47.730> example<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> have

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you have in game for example if you have

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
you have in game for example if you have
say<00:00:49.250> D<00:00:50.250> by<00:00:50.700> data<00:00:51.149> sea<00:00:51.989> instead<00:00:52.230> you'll<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
say D by data sea instead you'll want to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.540 
say D by data sea instead you'll want to
change<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:54.649> however<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.340> is

items of course do the same then make
another<00:01:11.729> file<00:01:12.119> I've<00:01:12.869> already<00:01:13.080> made<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
another file I've already made it and

good same point here how quick note
about<00:01:53.079> this<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:56.079> here<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:57.970> does

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
about this is right here what this does

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.200 
about this is right here what this does
is<00:01:58.539> this<00:01:58.780> allows<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.619> toggle<00:01:59.830> on<00:02:00.100> or<00:02:00.939> tug

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
is this allows you to toggle on or tug

is this allows you to toggle on or tug
love<00:02:01.450> smart<00:02:01.810> test<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:03.250> example<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.820> don't

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
love smart test for example if you don't

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.419 
love smart test for example if you don't
want<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.270> use<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.509> first<00:02:04.720> certain<00:02:05.080> guru<00:02:05.429> you

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
want to use the first certain guru you

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.479 
want to use the first certain guru you
can<00:02:06.610> use<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.420> easily<00:02:08.019> toggle<00:02:08.399> whether<00:02:09.399> or

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
can use this to easily toggle whether or

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.690 
can use this to easily toggle whether or
not<00:02:09.610> you're<00:02:09.880> using<00:02:10.090> smart<00:02:10.509> cast<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.580> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
not you're using smart cast know if you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.990 
not you're using smart cast know if you
don't<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.000> an<00:02:16.090> auto<00:02:16.299> accid<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:17.319> make<00:02:17.530> one

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
don't have an auto accid just make one

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.059 
don't have an auto accid just make one
and<00:02:19.000> if<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.690> don't<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:20.019> how<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.170> make<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.440> CFG

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
and if you don't know how to make a CFG

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.309 
and if you don't know how to make a CFG
file<00:02:22.230> simply<00:02:23.280> open<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.400> text<00:02:24.790> document<00:02:25.319> and

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
file simply open up a text document and

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:36.960 
file simply open up a text document and
then<00:02:27.599> call<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:31.590> autoexec<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:34.080> crg<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.610> that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
then call it autoexec not crg and that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:50.040 
then call it autoexec not crg and that
will<00:02:37.060> make<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.299> CFG<00:02:37.660> fellow

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.200 

now<00:02:50.650> before<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.160> works<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.030> make

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
now before this works you have to make

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.200 
now before this works you have to make
sure<00:02:52.240> done<00:02:52.660> behind<00:02:52.960> all<00:02:53.230> your<00:02:53.410> abilities<00:02:53.950> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
sure done behind all your abilities and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.970 
sure done behind all your abilities and
your<00:02:55.210> items<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.170> choose<00:02:56.410> these<00:02:56.620> smart

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
your items if you choose these smart

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.150 
your items if you choose these smart
cast<00:02:57.250> for<00:02:57.460> items<00:02:58.410> for<00:02:59.410> example<00:02:59.860> if<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.100> have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
cast for items for example if you have

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.350 
cast for items for example if you have
qwe<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.510> done<00:03:05.080> buying<00:03:05.410> these

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
qwe are and you done buying these

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.760 
qwe are and you done buying these
something<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:12.990> level<00:03:13.990> unbind<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
something do this level unbind it and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
something do this level unbind it and
then<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.460> can<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.700> same<00:03:15.850> thing<00:03:16.210> for<00:03:16.390> items

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.760 

if<00:03:21.790> everything<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.330> done<00:03:22.540> correctly<00:03:22.770> this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
if everything is done correctly this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.890 
if everything is done correctly this
should<00:03:23.830> enable<00:03:24.280> eat<00:03:24.580> smart<00:03:25.240> cast<00:03:25.510> your

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
should enable eat smart cast your

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.790 
should enable eat smart cast your
spell's<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:28.570> example<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:29.710> it

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
spell's for example this is what it

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.340 
spell's for example this is what it
looks<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.100> without<00:03:30.220> smartass

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
looks like without smartass
