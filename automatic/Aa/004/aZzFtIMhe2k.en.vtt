00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
course being a Chinese knockoff it's got

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.600 
course being a Chinese knockoff it's got
some<00:02:15.280> drawbacks<00:02:15.840> well<00:02:16.840> first<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.320> all<00:02:17.610> it's

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
some drawbacks well first of all it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.040 
some drawbacks well first of all it's
actually<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> build<00:02:19.330> quality<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:19.989> so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
actually the build quality is not so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.910 
actually the build quality is not so
superb<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:23.170> pretty<00:02:23.410> much<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:23.800> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
superb so it's it's pretty much what you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.580 
superb so it's it's pretty much what you
expect<00:02:24.280> from<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.520> Chinese<00:02:24.880> knockoff<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
expect from a Chinese knockoff but the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.949 
expect from a Chinese knockoff but the
thing<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.489> works<00:02:27.730> about<00:02:28.000> eight<00:02:28.239> hours<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.870> a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
thing is it works about eight hours on a

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.970 
thing is it works about eight hours on a
single<00:02:29.350> charge<00:02:30.930> very<00:02:31.930> portable<00:02:32.230> very<00:02:32.680> light

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
single charge very portable very light

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.550 
single charge very portable very light
and<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:34.180> works<00:02:34.450> best<00:02:34.720> when<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.049> put<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
and it works best when you put it in a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.160 
and it works best when you put it in a
corner<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.340> when<00:02:36.670> you've<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:36.790> two<00:02:37.150> walls<00:02:37.450> like

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
corner so when you've got two walls like

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
corner so when you've got two walls like
this<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.120> put<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> corner

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
this and you just put it in the corner
