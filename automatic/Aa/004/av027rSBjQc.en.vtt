00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.910
 so we will now tackle a technique called the present 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.019
 book one could just as well be precarious avenue east 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.319
 his name is not very important 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.319
 it simply consists of abdelmadjid 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.180
 % 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.860
 alinghi during the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 the junk the process of degrading 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.260
 outside to small shale of clear paint 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.430
 so white 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.390
 who comes the German club under his guidance with a slight advantage 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.310
 to start giving some kind of lighting 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.440
 and to make painting easier and to better visualize the places 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.700
 where the zenith light falls 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.420
 I start with the figurine 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 e beautiful colors% and rather dark and to spend much more 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.660
 opaque than if I had not done with the successive life techniques where 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.280
 other traditional techniques of degrading 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.520
 in this case here it's a pretty boy the fact that the skin ubs this 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.890
 figurine will be father 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.040
 is the technique of age really useless for figurines that have 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.009
 volumes money 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.560
 and who captures the light well 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.450
 for example on this piece the belly and very clear and very rock as well 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.750
 that the face as well as the hands 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.380
 as well as the top of the thigh and therefore the figurine is really enough in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.080
 volume l amf 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.700
 it is composed of two close-ups and large areas that will be susceptible 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.530
 to capture the light 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.750
 if the figurines too low 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.620
 for example like this 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.530
 let's imagine the haste for pasta 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 well 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.509
 the courage but not clear that is to say that the share of deposits 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.450
 the arm 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 the room is too much in the same plane 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.690
 and it does not open enough in the light 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.900
 so that the principle of loan to the arm that it is really visible 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.549
 especially since this piece is a piece has a majority parts 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.019
 metal and that courage but again not really ideal for by 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.759
 metallic parts but rather the matte parts 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 like the volumes the tissues 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.399
 this kind of 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.479
 present in rage 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.189
 it can be a little more directional for example if I wish 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.299
 it is a good lateral draw 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.459
 but we are talking about this side but on this side and here I will be able to accentuate 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.449
 also these with the preamble 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.009
 6 the example of my entourage 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.749
 I am that of the brush 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.889
 this cima area is much more enlightened than this one 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.069
 which is hidden in relation to the accident comes to the projected painting by the 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.869
 great painting 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.389
 it is thus quite possible to start from a black nutty figurine 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.599
 and to make courage on this black undercoat 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.569
 for me it is a disadvantage 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.339
 is that this base are so autonet which will be rather gray 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.739
 she will give birth 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.480
 even of richness in color generally this gave him my 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.789
 degraded work 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.949
 the fact is that if I do the moral price on the color that is already the color 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.549
 definitive part 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.329
 I'm painting 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.869
 well the green pigment will come out under the under layer 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.879
 and so the star couple will facilitate my work to degrade 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:41.379
 obviously if ever the figurine include other areas the money 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.440
 and of course most of the bases of all this wide area for example a 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.259
 dark brown trousers 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.819
 and dark green skin 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.389
 there is the courage so much that image on the tears areas 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:59.119
 he's the natively more useful hero for me two a month the armbands in 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.739
 colors to sink in because the courage will not be sufficiently visible 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 on this little 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.399
 Let's go 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.569
 overall bad experience 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.129
 among 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.830
 in the euphrates 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.009
 who will pay 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.009
 overall yes 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.569
 in the sum 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.569
 dance 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.050
 here again is the experience and the practice 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.900
 that allow you to many others and develop the bomb 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.599
 as to the level of the quantity that 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.110
 we want 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.369
 by which close to the painting
