00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
might skip and this really adds to this

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680

people<00:04:27.580> would<00:04:27.700> skip<00:04:28.060> this<00:04:28.980> just<00:04:29.980> because<00:04:30.340> it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
people would skip this just because it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.700 
people would skip this just because it
adds<00:04:30.490> time<00:04:31.000> because<00:04:31.420> time<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.990> money<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.380> the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
adds time because time is money and the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.500 
adds time because time is money and the
faster<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.130> can<00:04:33.400> do<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> design<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.330> more

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
faster you can do a design the more

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.100 
faster you can do a design the more
designs<00:04:35.169> you<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:35.530> take<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:36.510> I've<00:04:37.510> had<00:04:37.810> plenty

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
designs you can take in I've had plenty

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.300 
designs you can take in I've had plenty
of<00:04:38.230> days<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.919> my<00:04:39.100> shop<00:04:39.460> where<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:41.190> wasn't<00:04:42.190> able

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
of days in my shop where I wasn't able

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.210 
of days in my shop where I wasn't able
to<00:04:42.490> take<00:04:42.790> everything<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.510> came<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.200> had<00:04:45.070> to

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
to take everything that came in I had to

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.670 
to take everything that came in I had to
turn<00:04:45.400> people<00:04:45.460> down<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:46.000> had<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.390> say<00:04:46.630> I'm<00:04:46.810> I'm<00:04:47.200> so

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
turn people down I had to say I'm I'm so

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.890 
turn people down I had to say I'm I'm so
backed<00:04:47.980> up<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.460> can't<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.060> can't<00:04:49.510> take<00:04:49.720> you

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
backed up that I can't I can't take you

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.440 
backed up that I can't I can't take you
on<00:04:50.020> today<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:51.640> was<00:04:51.760> disappointing<00:04:52.419> for

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
on today and that was disappointing for

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.000 
on today and that was disappointing for
people<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.110> was<00:04:53.200> disappointing<00:04:53.380> for<00:04:53.830> me

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
people and it was disappointing for me

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.730 
people and it was disappointing for me
because<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.580> had<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.820> turn<00:04:55.000> down<00:04:55.240> money<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:58.740> one

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
because I had to turn down money and one

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.190 
because I had to turn down money and one
way<00:04:59.919> you<00:04:59.950> can<00:05:00.250> counteract<00:05:00.669> that<00:05:00.970> like<00:05:01.720> after

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
way you can counteract that like after

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.880 
way you can counteract that like after
that<00:05:02.380> day<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.919> went<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.300> took<00:05:04.680> kind<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.800> a

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
that day I went and I took kind of a

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.860 
that day I went and I took kind of a
look<00:05:06.070> back<00:05:06.310> at<00:05:06.550> my<00:05:06.669> display<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.150> see<00:05:07.630> where<00:05:07.840> I

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
look back at my display to see where I

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.070 
look back at my display to see where I
could<00:05:08.020> trim<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.560> fat<00:05:08.800> where<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.660> had<00:05:10.660> designs

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
could trim the fat where I had designs

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.010 
could trim the fat where I had designs
that<00:05:11.350> might<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.770> been<00:05:11.890> popular<00:05:12.870> but<00:05:13.870> they

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
that might have been popular but they

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.750 
that might have been popular but they
were<00:05:14.080> taking<00:05:14.530> me<00:05:14.650> too<00:05:14.830> long<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.100> do<00:05:15.430> they<00:05:15.669> were

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
were taking me too long to do they were

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.050 
were taking me too long to do they were
holding<00:05:16.000> me<00:05:16.270> up<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:17.770> replaced<00:05:18.610> them<00:05:18.850> with<00:05:18.880> a

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
holding me up and I replaced them with a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.560 
holding me up and I replaced them with a
simplified<00:05:19.690> version<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.290> that<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.860> then<00:05:21.790> it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
simplified version of that and then it

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.420 
simplified version of that and then it
really<00:05:23.230> streamlined<00:05:23.830> things<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.310> made

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
really streamlined things and made

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.340 
really streamlined things and made
things<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.790> lot<00:05:24.940> better<00:05:25.000> what<00:05:25.750> I've<00:05:25.870> done<00:05:26.050> there

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
things a lot better what I've done there

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.680 
things a lot better what I've done there
is<00:05:26.560> I've<00:05:26.800> completed<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.640> dots<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.510> can

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
is I've completed the dots and you can

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.420 
is I've completed the dots and you can
tell<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.140> adds<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.620> lot<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.830> realism<00:05:29.950> to

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
tell that that adds a lot of realism to

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.659 
tell that that adds a lot of realism to
the<00:05:30.640> ball<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.660> also<00:05:31.840> lightly<00:05:32.800> shaded<00:05:33.370> with

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
the ball and I also lightly shaded with

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.490 
the ball and I also lightly shaded with
that<00:05:33.850> black<00:05:34.180> down<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.690> center<00:05:35.050> line<00:05:35.080> because

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
that black down that center line because

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.920 
that black down that center line because
it's<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.770> little<00:05:35.919> darker<00:05:36.430> okay<00:05:36.970> now<00:05:37.690> I'm<00:05:37.810> going

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
it's a little darker okay now I'm going

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.860 
it's a little darker okay now I'm going
to<00:05:38.020> come<00:05:38.260> in<00:05:38.470> with<00:05:38.860> wicked<00:05:39.340> blue<00:05:39.729> which<00:05:40.600> is

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
to come in with wicked blue which is

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.080 
to come in with wicked blue which is
there<00:05:41.470> there

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
I'm just going to bridge that transition

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.310 
I'm just going to bridge that transition
a<00:05:46.949> little<00:05:47.190> bit<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.940> notice<00:05:48.270> how<00:05:48.449> when<00:05:48.810> making

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
a little bit you notice how when making

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.260 
a little bit you notice how when making
this<00:05:49.620> shadow<00:05:49.919> I'm<00:05:50.130> staying<00:05:50.430> off<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.850> edge<00:05:50.970> I'm

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
this shadow I'm staying off the edge I'm

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.969 
this shadow I'm staying off the edge I'm
keeping<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.690> little<00:05:51.870> light<00:05:52.169> down<00:05:52.199> there<00:05:52.710> so

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
keeping a little light down there so

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.600 
keeping a little light down there so
that<00:05:53.160> it<00:05:53.310> looks<00:05:53.580> right<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:56.250> don't<00:05:56.400> want<00:05:56.550> to

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
that it looks right you don't want to

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.000 
that it looks right you don't want to
get<00:05:56.699> too<00:05:56.940> terribly<00:05:57.419> dark<00:05:57.750> with<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.199> now<00:05:58.979> I

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
get too terribly dark with this now I

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.340 
get too terribly dark with this now I
want<00:05:59.340> to<00:05:59.400> put<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> name<00:05:59.850> on<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.270> design<00:06:00.720> I'm

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
want to put a name on this design I'm

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.719 
want to put a name on this design I'm
going<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:01.620> give<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:01.860> kind<00:06:02.040> of<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.250> hint<00:06:02.550> about

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
going to give you kind of a hint about

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.030 
going to give you kind of a hint about
color<00:06:03.419> usage<00:06:03.900> on<00:06:04.110> names<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.710> things<00:06:04.889> like

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
color usage on names and things like

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.129 
color usage on names and things like
that<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.729> is<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.970> baseball<00:06:06.479> so<00:06:06.690> we<00:06:06.840> figure

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
that this is a baseball so we figure

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.290 
that this is a baseball so we figure
America's<00:06:07.680> pastime<00:06:08.100> so<00:06:08.250> red<00:06:08.699> white<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.120> blue

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
America's pastime so red white and blue

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.760 
America's pastime so red white and blue
and<00:06:09.510> that<00:06:09.780> kind<00:06:10.020> of<00:06:10.080> goes<00:06:10.290> with<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.560> color

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
and that kind of goes with the color

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.010 
and that kind of goes with the color
scheme<00:06:10.949> we've<00:06:11.250> got<00:06:11.460> here<00:06:11.850> if<00:06:11.970> I<00:06:12.180> wanted<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.840> put

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
scheme we've got here if I wanted to put

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.780 
scheme we've got here if I wanted to put
a<00:06:13.050> red<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.500> blue<00:06:13.650> name<00:06:13.919> up<00:06:14.130> here<00:06:14.310> I<00:06:14.340> have<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.760> be

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790
