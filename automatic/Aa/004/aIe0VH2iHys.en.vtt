does a huge element to binge drinking I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
does a huge element to binge drinking I
think<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> competition<00:01:33.960> between<00:01:34.079> the

think that's the key is to be a fun
person<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.049> need<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.349> take<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.819> however

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
person you need to take like however

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.820 
person you need to take like however
many<00:02:28.030> shots<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.540> takes<00:02:28.750> until<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.799> a

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
many shots it takes until you get to a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.070 
many shots it takes until you get to a
certain<00:02:29.890> drunkness<00:02:30.730> where<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.660> think<00:02:31.959> you're

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
certain drunkness where you think you're

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.050 
certain drunkness where you think you're
fun<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.620> me<00:02:32.799> personally<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.430> think<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
fun for me personally I think it's the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.860 
fun for me personally I think it's the
fact<00:02:34.299> that<00:02:34.769> society<00:02:35.769> plays<00:02:36.099> such<00:02:37.060> hard<00:02:37.510> role

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
fact that society plays such hard role

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.710 
fact that society plays such hard role
in<00:02:38.200> drinking<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.849> when<00:02:40.390> you're<00:02:40.630> in

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
in drinking it's like when you're in

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.140 
in drinking it's like when you're in
high<00:02:40.780> school<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.560> say<00:02:41.860> hey<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.760> cannot

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
when kids come to college they don't

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.650 
when kids come to college they don't
know<00:02:59.470> they<00:03:00.459> don't<00:03:00.489> know<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:01.120> their<00:03:01.299> limits

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
know they don't know what their limits

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.870 
know they don't know what their limits
are<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:02.019> don't<00:03:02.200> know<00:03:02.530> what<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> right<00:03:03.549> place

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
are they don't know what the right place

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.090 
are they don't know what the right place
to<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.389> when<00:03:04.600> they're<00:03:04.780> drinking<00:03:05.100> because

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
to be is when they're drinking because

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.250 
to be is when they're drinking because
they've<00:03:06.340> never<00:03:06.370> drinkin<00:03:07.090> before<00:03:07.420> some<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
they've never drinkin before some of the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.620 
they've never drinkin before some of the
kids<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.889> think<00:03:08.920> when<00:03:09.639> they<00:03:09.790> come<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.180> college

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
kids I think when they come to college

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.900 
kids I think when they come to college
they<00:03:11.350> start<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.709> drink<00:03:11.950> way<00:03:12.160> too<00:03:12.190> much<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
they start to drink way too much the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.340 
they start to drink way too much the
problem<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.420> they<00:03:13.600> haven't<00:03:13.840> actually

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
problem is they haven't actually

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.440 
problem is they haven't actually
drinking<00:03:15.220> before<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> actual

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
drinking before that's the actual

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.109 
drinking before that's the actual
problem
