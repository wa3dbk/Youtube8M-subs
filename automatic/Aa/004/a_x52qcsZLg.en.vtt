better job picking those runners off at
first<00:00:19.310> base<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:19.880> involves<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.720> little<00:00:21.230> tip

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
first base and involves a little tip

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.759 
first base and involves a little tip
here<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.130> can<00:00:22.820> quicken<00:00:23.150> up<00:00:23.420> that<00:00:23.660> throw<00:00:24.050> from

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
here that can quicken up that throw from

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.890 
here that can quicken up that throw from
the<00:00:24.890> male<00:00:25.070> in<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.279> first<00:00:25.519> base<00:00:25.820> now<00:00:26.119> most

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
the male in the first base now most

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.630 
the male in the first base now most
pitchers<00:00:27.289> learn<00:00:27.589> at<00:00:27.769> a<00:00:27.859> fairly<00:00:28.130> pretty<00:00:28.490> early

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
pitchers learn at a fairly pretty early

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.790 
pitchers learn at a fairly pretty early
age<00:00:28.939> that<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.869> important<00:00:30.349> that<00:00:30.380> they<00:00:30.589> want

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
age that it's important that they want

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.679 
age that it's important that they want
to<00:00:30.859> try<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.189> create<00:00:31.490> some<00:00:31.759> big<00:00:31.970> circles<00:00:32.480> when

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
to try to create some big circles when

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.720 
to try to create some big circles when
they<00:00:32.870> pitch<00:00:33.110> now<00:00:33.440> different<00:00:34.190> pitchers<00:00:34.550> are

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
they pitch now different pitchers are

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.520 
they pitch now different pitchers are
going<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.000> vary<00:00:35.270> in<00:00:35.480> terms<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:35.870> how<00:00:36.020> big<00:00:36.320> their

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to vary in terms of how big their

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.800 
going to vary in terms of how big their
circle<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:37.400> basically<00:00:37.820> if<00:00:38.300> they<00:00:38.600> can

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
circle is but basically if they can

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.720 
circle is but basically if they can
increase<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.560> length<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:40.039> their<00:00:40.219> arm<00:00:40.489> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
increase the length of their arm and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.490 
increase the length of their arm and
create<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> bigger<00:00:41.329> circle<00:00:41.960> when<00:00:42.110> they<00:00:42.260> pitch

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
create a bigger circle when they pitch

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.260 
create a bigger circle when they pitch
they're<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.340> get<00:00:43.489> more<00:00:43.730> out<00:00:43.969> of<00:00:44.000> their

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
they're going to get more out of their

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.389 
they're going to get more out of their
arm<00:00:44.510> well<00:00:45.050> that's<00:00:45.199> great<00:00:45.530> if<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:46.010> have<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.370> time

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
arm well that's great if I have the time

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.189 
arm well that's great if I have the time
to<00:00:46.760> do<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.090> when<00:00:47.359> I'm<00:00:47.600> throwing<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.020> ball<00:00:48.170> to

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
to do that when I'm throwing the ball to

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.540 
to do that when I'm throwing the ball to
home<00:00:48.410> plate<00:00:48.469> but<00:00:49.430> if<00:00:49.609> I<00:00:49.820> still<00:00:50.270> keep<00:00:50.539> that<00:00:50.809> long

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
home plate but if I still keep that long

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.150 
home plate but if I still keep that long
slow<00:00:52.550> circle<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:53.750> first<00:00:53.989> base<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.949> course

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
slow circle to first base of course

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.770 
slow circle to first base of course
that's<00:00:55.460> going<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.760> give<00:00:55.940> more<00:00:56.180> time<00:00:56.449> for<00:00:56.690> that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
that's going to give more time for that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.889 
that's going to give more time for that
runner<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.590> dive<00:00:57.800> back<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.460> be<00:00:59.000> safe<00:00:59.239> so<00:00:59.539> if<00:00:59.719> I

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
runner to dive back and be safe so if I

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.630 
runner to dive back and be safe so if I
am<00:01:00.050> from<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.379> stretch<00:01:00.620> position<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.370> come

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
am from the stretch position and I come

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.600 
am from the stretch position and I come
set<00:01:02.000> basically<00:01:02.960> big<00:01:03.410> circles<00:01:03.980> when<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.250> turn

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
set basically big circles when I turn

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.850 
set basically big circles when I turn
the<00:01:04.820> throw<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.059> first<00:01:05.180> base<00:01:05.480> is<00:01:05.900> going<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.680> be

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
the throw to first base is going to be

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.830 
the throw to first base is going to be
my<00:01:07.130> enemy<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.730> here's<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.090> quick<00:01:08.360> little<00:01:08.570> tip

particularly<00:01:11.150> older<00:01:11.480> pitchers<00:01:11.870> who<00:01:12.050> have<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
particularly older pitchers who have a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260 
particularly older pitchers who have a
little<00:01:12.440> bit<00:01:12.590> more<00:01:12.710> arm<00:01:12.950> strength<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.550> quicken

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
little bit more arm strength to quicken

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.440 
little bit more arm strength to quicken
up<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.600> delivery<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:16.190> throw<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.760> first

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
up that delivery and that throw to first

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.810 
up that delivery and that throw to first
base<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.990> here's<00:01:18.230> my<00:01:18.410> tip<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.280> show<00:01:19.490> all<00:01:19.670> my

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
base so here's my tip that I show all my

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.400 
base so here's my tip that I show all my
pictures<00:01:20.030> here<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.600> terms<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:21.020> picking<00:01:21.290> guys

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
pictures here in terms of picking guys

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.680 
pictures here in terms of picking guys
off<00:01:21.710> at<00:01:21.860> first<00:01:22.040> base<00:01:22.340> well<00:01:22.940> often<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.330> will<00:01:23.510> have

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
off at first base well often I will have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.710 
off at first base well often I will have
them<00:01:23.900> do<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.380> drill<00:01:24.680> without<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> ball<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
them do this drill without a ball the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.350 
them do this drill without a ball the
first<00:01:26.960> couple<00:01:27.290> times<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.920> then<00:01:28.460> try<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.760> with

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
first couple times and then try it with

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.240 
first couple times and then try it with
a<00:01:29.390> glove<00:01:29.690> on<00:01:29.780> their<00:01:29.930> hand<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.350> will<00:01:30.890> have<00:01:31.070> them

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
a glove on their hand I will have them

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
a glove on their hand I will have them
come<00:01:31.310> set<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.060> separate<00:01:32.600> their<00:01:32.840> hands<00:01:33.200> now

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
come set and separate their hands now

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.960 
come set and separate their hands now
when<00:01:33.710> they<00:01:33.830> have<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.220> ball<00:01:34.460> right<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:34.820> front

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
when they have that ball right in front

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.150 
when they have that ball right in front
of<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.150> chest<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.780> will<00:01:35.810> tell<00:01:36.140> them<00:01:36.380> when<00:01:37.010> they

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
of the chest I will tell them when they

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.190 
of the chest I will tell them when they
go<00:01:37.340> through<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.760> footwork<00:01:38.150> keep<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.990> ball

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
go through the footwork keep the ball

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.460 
go through the footwork keep the ball
right<00:01:39.710> here<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.370> ball<00:01:40.550> stays<00:01:41.030> put<00:01:41.540> even

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
right here the ball stays put even

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.170 
right here the ball stays put even
though<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:42.680> are<00:01:42.860> turning<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.670> first<00:01:43.940> base

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
though you are turning to a first base

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.570 
though you are turning to a first base
so<00:01:44.450> if<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.630> do<00:01:44.690> in<00:01:44.930> slow<00:01:45.200> motion<00:01:45.650> here<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:46.040> come

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
so if I do in slow motion here I come

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910 
so if I do in slow motion here I come
set<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.570> ball<00:01:47.780> stays<00:01:48.110> right<00:01:48.380> here<00:01:48.440> when<00:01:48.890> I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
set and the ball stays right here when I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.320 
set and the ball stays right here when I
go<00:01:49.160> through<00:01:49.190> my<00:01:49.460> footwork<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.750> ball<00:01:51.220> stays

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
go through my footwork the ball stays

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.390 
go through my footwork the ball stays
right<00:01:53.330> at<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:53.810> level<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.470> want<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.040> try<00:01:55.340> to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
right at that level I want to try to

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.630 
right at that level I want to try to
avoid<00:01:55.820> coming<00:01:56.300> down<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.190> creating<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.340> big

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
avoid coming down and creating that big

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.550 
avoid coming down and creating that big
path<00:01:58.940> which<00:01:59.480> is<00:01:59.510> going<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.840> allow<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.080> runner

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
path which is going to allow that runner

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.680 
path which is going to allow that runner
to<00:02:00.710> come<00:02:00.890> back<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.820> tip<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.210> when<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.510> come

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
to come back so the tip is when you come

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.900 
to come back so the tip is when you come
set<00:02:02.990> keep<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.860> ball<00:02:04.070> right<00:02:04.370> here

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
set keep the ball right here

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.090 
set keep the ball right here
and<00:02:05.000> when<00:02:05.540> your<00:02:05.690> body<00:02:05.900> turns<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.560> first<00:02:06.830> base

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
and when your body turns the first base

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.790 
and when your body turns the first base
your<00:02:08.090> hand<00:02:08.360> will<00:02:08.569> be<00:02:08.599> in<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.989> short<00:02:09.319> throwing

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
your hand will be in a short throwing

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.190 
your hand will be in a short throwing
position<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.520> small<00:02:10.849> circle<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.480> then<00:02:12.020> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
position a small circle and then you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.949 
position a small circle and then you
just<00:02:12.470> make<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.280> throw<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.520> first<00:02:13.790> base<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.780> if

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
just make the throw to first base so if

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.559 
just make the throw to first base so if
it's<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.260> real<00:02:15.530> time<00:02:15.829> I<00:02:16.159> can<00:02:16.879> start<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.390> ball

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
it's in real time I can start the ball

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.910 
it's in real time I can start the ball
right<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:17.810> turn

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
right here turn

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.210 
right here turn
and<00:02:19.760> throw<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.600> all<00:02:20.720> starts<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.830> keeping

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and throw but it all starts with keeping

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.120 
and throw but it all starts with keeping
that<00:02:22.670> ball<00:02:22.910> chest<00:02:23.420> high<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.860> don't

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
that ball chest high so that you don't

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.820 
that ball chest high so that you don't
allow<00:02:25.520> your<00:02:25.760> arm<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.360> through<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:27.560> big

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
allow your arm to go through that big

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.770 
allow your arm to go through that big
path<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.790> your<00:02:28.940> tip<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.090> today<00:02:29.300> thanks
