it's not going to be the same kind of
texture<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.180> was<00:02:24.330> before<00:02:24.800> alright<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> just

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
texture as it was before alright so just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.580 
texture as it was before alright so just
continue<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.940> press<00:02:30.330> down<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.870> remember<00:02:31.170> we

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
continue to press down on it remember we

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.610 
continue to press down on it remember we
want<00:02:31.740> an<00:02:31.890> even<00:02:32.100> layer<00:02:32.460> if<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:33.990> get<00:02:34.350> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
and you get it how you want it to be

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.080 
and you get it how you want it to be
what<00:03:02.190> you're<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.610> want<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
what you're going to want to do is you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.210 
what you're going to want to do is you
leave<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.540> out<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.930> open<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.590> let<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.830> dry

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
leave it out in the open and let it dry

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310 
leave it out in the open and let it dry
for<00:03:05.280> about<00:03:05.970> an<00:03:06.270> hour<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.780> think<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.200> will

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
for about an hour I think this will

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.370 
for about an hour I think this will
probably<00:03:07.560> take<00:03:07.770> an<00:03:07.920> hour<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.990> after<00:03:09.990> it's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
probably take an hour and after it's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.610 
probably take an hour and after it's
done<00:03:10.970> drying<00:03:11.970> out<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.570> should<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:12.930> back<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.380> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
done drying out it should be back to the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
done drying out it should be back to the
way<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.800> was<00:03:13.860> alright<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.150> I've<00:03:15.300> waited<00:03:15.570> an

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
way it was alright so I've waited an

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.670 
way it was alright so I've waited an
hour<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:18.240> alcohol<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.050> put<00:03:19.470> in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
hour so and the alcohol that I put in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.060 
hour so and the alcohol that I put in
the<00:03:19.830> foundation<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.900> translucent<00:03:21.900> powder

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
the foundation and translucent powder

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.160 
the foundation and translucent powder
has<00:03:23.070> dried<00:03:23.490> up<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.820> now<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.330> looks<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.630> this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.040 

it's<00:03:28.170> still<00:03:28.470> powdery<00:03:29.720> there's<00:03:30.720> nothing<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.840 
it's still powdery there's nothing to
worry<00:03:31.290> about<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:32.100> back<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.580> way<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.820> was

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
worry about it's back to the way it was

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.710 
worry about it's back to the way it was
before<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.510> dropped<00:03:33.990> it<00:03:34.140> like<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> klutz
