six wells until it's all absorbed and

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.800 
six wells until it's all absorbed and
give<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.039> little<00:02:02.189> stir<00:02:04.879> like<00:02:05.879> pop<00:02:06.209> rocks<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
give it a little stir like pop rocks and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.039 
give it a little stir like pop rocks and
mochi<00:02:07.200> mix<00:02:07.409> together<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:09.690> changing

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
mochi mix together and it's changing

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.350 
mochi mix together and it's changing
color<00:02:10.289> initially<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:11.039> solution<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.150> blue

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
color initially the solution was blue

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800 
color initially the solution was blue
and<00:02:12.660> we've<00:02:13.349> added<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.890> stuff<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.510> multi

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and we've added this stuff the multi

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.349 
and we've added this stuff the multi
powder<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.260> pink<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.879> mix<00:02:18.090> them<00:02:18.180> together

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
powder is pink so we mix them together

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.770 
powder is pink so we mix them together
it<00:02:18.720> turns<00:02:18.900> purple<00:02:20.269> okay<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.329> we're<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.720> to

it turns purple okay so we're going to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.580 
it turns purple okay so we're going to
fill<00:02:22.019> tray<00:02:22.470> number<00:02:22.620> two<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> water<00:02:24.569> line<00:02:24.870> so
