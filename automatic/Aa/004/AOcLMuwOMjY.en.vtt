00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.830
 very good scoundrels welcome to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.830
 a new video we are here with our 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.240
 an elephant is not the elephant manolo 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.240
 valdÃ©s 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.259
 today 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.210
 because of the monkey is the elephant manolo 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.880
 that does not have horns and good is a the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.880
 exotic and what has fun 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.730
 As you all know we are in a time 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.270
 this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270
 with the family 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.250
 two 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.410
 that's why then we have decided 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 a video that has to do with that subject 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 do not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.949
 today we come to talk about the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 carols those traditional songs 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.940
 Well, we sing them all in the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.040
 Christmas Eve and Christmas family and so on 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 but what surprisingly here in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.229
 Spain as other things are prisms or 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.180
 it has a level of shabby 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.920
 awesome for example in usa there 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.880
 songs there are Christmas carols that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880
 they have unique possibilities 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.800
 in Spain instead if we put ourselves 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.700
 read the lyrics of the songs of the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 old years 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.110
 but what kind of Neanderthal has put 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.290
 to sit down to write this typeface 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.750
 and I was thinking I think the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.670
 inventor of these carols to catch the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.830
 dictionary I've put it to catch a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.390
 shovel and he started hitting shovels like that 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.160
 word that you went allison for walking and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 antilles directly or for example 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.950
 we have carols here like the one in asia 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.590
 nativity scene for a donkey rin rin me 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 I re darned mendez I took me a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.500
 patch and me 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.890
 loaded with chocolate I recommended 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 previous analysis 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.979
 he is carrying a donkey apprentice 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 ring ring from when the donkey does 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.540
 among you when you ride 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.540
 children had a bell on a bike 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.170
 sanz then says I was busting myself 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.940
 suddenly the verb mend that it came out 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.390
 search the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 means reform 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.150
 broken old 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.730
 I do not know is that he does not have any kind of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.490
 it felt like that but there they know it is already taught 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.520
 same 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.520
 if I burst 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 that within 15 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.250
 and finally loaded with chocolate that is 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.320
 the chocolate if I do not get confused did not arrive 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.050
 until until colon discovered america 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.800
 and that I do not know where the fuck the fuck 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 chocolates vale 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.769
 it would not be greater 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.330
 unless that rider with the donkey that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330
 I was doing up 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.790
 I do not know what good end does not 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 we also have other carols 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.760
 like but watch how the fish drink in 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 the river 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.959
 the fish in the river the pp that lives in the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.450
 river therefore they arm me if they drink and 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.939
 they drink and go back to drink the fish in the 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 river to see god do nothing because 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:47.129
 the fish because that animal goes into thirst 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.840
 our lord and not drink water since the 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.120
 low 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.069
 do not carry species 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.740
 and well let's close this repertoire 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.910
 of carols number one in Spain 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.580
 after the famous bell on bell 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.930
 attentive to this letter bell about 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.230
 bell on bell a look at the 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.330
 window you will see the child at the wedding this is 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.820
 basically that the author is thinking to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.130
 see what there is one with a bell 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 window and with a cradle that is and mixing 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.700
 and putting there because the client in a 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.470
 kind of sense 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.450
 I believe that this writer is nothing 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.110
 he started playing scrabble and 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.120
 first words that animated the with 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.030
 one and another and then nothing for the country 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.170
 the letter to letter bell a window one 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.170
 work went along the track 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.139
 in this carol we also have 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.790
 picked up you picked up in your flock where 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.130
 you go pastor and then the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.800
 little pastor is very clever, I'll answer 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.669
 to take to the butter cheese portal and 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.669
 came or well we have a new child 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.050
 born jesus is in the cradle and you do not know 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.000
 something else happens you will not take it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.130
 a toy you will not take a pacifier 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.169
 or some diapers that they are very expensive and 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.540
 Maria will come great not because 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.500
 just with something else that the child would carry 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.540
 cottage cheese butter and wine came to reds 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.680
 Wine detail and the child does not know or 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.680
 talk about the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.980
 one 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.650
 to all this on top you have to add or 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.360
 be that these carols are usually 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.610
 sing or are usually played with 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.850
 absurd instruments also Spanish 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.510
 fuck like the zambomba or is it a 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.280
 stick and a sponge and face it but 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.170
 well in spite of all this is sure that 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.340
 more than half of the people who are 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.440
 watching these videos had never been 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.720
 raised the letter 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.250
 identical gestures so what else does the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.230
 Christmas once a year and by singing 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.720
 absurd songs will not happen anything 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.790
 quite tired of throughout the year 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.470
 but good you are in our video today 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.180
 We hope you liked that the 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.400
 You have had a good time at Christmas singing 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.949
 these weird physicists 10 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.509
 and as always we tell you to like 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.340
 the video leaves a cool comment with 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:07.340
 some idea some constructive criticism 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:11.320
 always constructive and you pass 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.320
 and so, subscribe to what 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:24.000
 all this because he does not have 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.050
 well we also want to leave them here at 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.240
 final because the reason why we have 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.510
 taken so much in uploading other videos is 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.370
 an activity exactly and you can give 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.280
 some pics I hope it costs and good 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:48.470
 states introduced to the bug the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.470
 family is a dog visits to youtube 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.750
 good and that and now until the next 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.750
 video
