and foremost in my mind and speaking

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.880 
and foremost in my mind and speaking
about<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
about this in that what you do when you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.600 
about this in that what you do when you
meditate<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.300> access<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.410> missing<00:00:56.070> link

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
between the intake of scripture and an

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
between the intake of scripture and an
effective<00:01:00.359> pair<00:01:00.690> life<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.379> think

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
effective pair life so you can think
