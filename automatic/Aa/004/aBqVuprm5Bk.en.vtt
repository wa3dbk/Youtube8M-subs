00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.280
 hi everyone guys are giving caliendo 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.509
 real estate fan page in this fast 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 videorecensione to talk to you about 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 an application for android that exists 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 already for some time but that is precisely what to do 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 undead you know is an application 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 to record in video what 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 happens on the display of your smartphone 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.140
 it's called screencast video recorder and it is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.269
 an attenuation you anticipate that you can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.020
 use only if yours 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.750
 device to the root so if not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 you did everything you can't use 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 the screencast application you can remember 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.539
 download from play stop in demo mode 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.149
 once you buy it however it is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.390
 can activate different features 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.000
 and delete for example the limit of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.860
 time for registration for that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 that already of this application is that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.670
 also records from the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.120
 device while recording rai videos 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 from different settings to change 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 you can choose the resolution of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 video you can choose the orientation 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.080
 of the video that can be automatic ie 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.229
 based on device orientation 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 or blocked or set 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 manually 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 you can choose the framerate e 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.189
 obviously having passed because I want to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 that the junction that records if a fluid 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.080
 you can choose the time laps that is the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.229
 speed with which you want 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.299
 video recording is also possible 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 also choose the type of pointer that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860
 we want to be displayed in the video 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 when we go to plug right on 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 display I now choose the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 circle and then you will see on the display 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.869
 also you can set different 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 settings also regarding 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.060
 saving screenshots of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 device but the nice thing is this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450
 since not all devices 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 android years 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.750
 the same technical characteristics for 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.700
 recording a video is necessary 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.009
 however a device that has a 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 this is quite a fast professor 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.759
 tests that can be done directly 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.140
 applications also available in 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.039
 demo version that will give you the chance 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.649
 to understand if your device in 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.640
 whether or not able to record video and to what 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.610
 speed 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.739
 obviously the galaxy note two is 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.769
 fast the framerate reached in 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.900
 recording is about 42 per frame per 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.700
 second then with this device yes 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.950
 manages to record everything without any 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 problem to perform recordings 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.319
 of the video what needs to be done 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.959
 come back 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.090
 the first page you see wait for that 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.880
 the application gets root permissions 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.349
 so that a shell is just granted 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.810
 record what happens on the video e 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.190
 press the start button 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.110
 right now we are recording 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.630
 both video and video are recorded 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.269
 the audio coming back home but now 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.040
 let's do something right to do 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.040
 see the fluidity of the video 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.190
 registration finished what you need 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.780
 do you have to go back to the application e 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.650
 block stopping apologize for 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.690
 registration 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.730
 having done this it is necessary to wait a few 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.109
 second to wait for them 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.209
 applications and processes 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.510
 the video that we will then find in the second one 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.920
 application menu item 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.690
 This of course, here you see that we 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.459
 did a test before tapping on this one 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.290
 central icon you can share it 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.069
 cocks we witness inside says that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.540
 has android 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.590
 now for example we share it on 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.790
 facebook video sharing word e 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.470
 we publish 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.780
 furthermore we find it in the roll 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.310
 photographic of the device and we can 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.819
 also and play it by pressing the button 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.819
 beautiful 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.750
 let's do something right to do 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.340
 see the convenience of the videos really 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.099
 this noise you hear below 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.659
 mount and the phone dancing on the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.849
 dock anyway this guys said 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.560
 really useful protection admits 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.180
 dime then I have often said to 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.950
 make reviews excels of the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.590
 sin that does not record all 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
 elements of the display video, excuse me 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.359
 because for example in applications like 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.859
 skype doesn't record the video because 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.659
 allows is reproduced with a different one 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.980
 a different engine had said this 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.390
 you can practically record 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.310
 everything that happens on the display 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.760
 need ndaw firm gifts for fans 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.979
 page 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.269
 I give you a passionate hug and 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.780
 obviously appointment to the next 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.780
 then
