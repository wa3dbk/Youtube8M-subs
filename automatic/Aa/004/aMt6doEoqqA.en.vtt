00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
maybe the circle shape at the top should

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.160 
maybe the circle shape at the top should
be<00:01:56.790> smaller<00:01:57.150> so<00:02:02.150> it's<00:02:03.150> your<00:02:03.330> big<00:02:03.540> fittest<00:02:03.930> size

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
be smaller so it's your big fittest size

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:26.590 
be smaller so it's your big fittest size
still<00:02:04.590> thing<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:16.320> one

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
okay that looks okay I guess so now I'm

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.000 
okay that looks okay I guess so now I'm
gonna<00:02:38.060> put<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> water<00:02:38.720> inside<00:02:41.650> still<00:02:42.650> just

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
gonna put the water inside still just

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
gonna put the water inside still just
like<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:44.860> when<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.100> see<00:02:46.340> how<00:02:46.520> high<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.819> water

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
like this when I see how high the water

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.800

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
didn't really work out so well well that

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.120 
didn't really work out so well well that
was<00:06:06.840> my<00:06:06.960> first<00:06:07.230> attempt<00:06:07.680> then<00:06:07.920> I<00:06:07.950> made<00:06:08.100> a

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130

was my first attempt then I made a
bigger<00:06:08.370> one<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:09.650> think<00:06:10.650> this<00:06:11.010> one<00:06:11.220> looks<00:06:11.910> kind

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
bigger one I think this one looks kind

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.990 
bigger one I think this one looks kind
of<00:06:12.210> better<00:06:12.420> but<00:06:12.900> then<00:06:13.160> his<00:06:14.160> face<00:06:14.490> wasn't<00:06:14.730> big

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
of better but then his face wasn't big

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.600 
of better but then his face wasn't big
enough<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.390> make<00:06:15.480> it<00:06:15.540> detailed<00:06:15.990> so<00:06:16.290> I<00:06:16.610> said

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
enough to make it detailed so I said

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.570
