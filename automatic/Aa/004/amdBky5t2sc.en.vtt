mil<00:03:02.780> perspex<00:03:03.780> rod<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.200> top<00:03:06.110> throughout

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
mil perspex rod on the top throughout

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.550 
mil perspex rod on the top throughout
the<00:03:07.230> top<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.710> building<00:03:08.070> there<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the top of the building there and on the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.010 
the top of the building there and on the
top<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> rod<00:03:11.990> that<00:03:12.990> pin<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.830> sit

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
top of the rod that pin is going to sit

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.390 
top of the rod that pin is going to sit
so<00:03:16.020> two<00:03:16.440> moments<00:03:16.860> let<00:03:17.010> me<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.280> put

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
so two moments let me just put

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.680 
so two moments let me just put
everything<00:03:17.640> together<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.270> Thunder<00:03:18.540> hook

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
everything together on the Thunder hook

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.720 
everything together on the Thunder hook
so<00:03:18.930> far<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:19.770> zoom<00:03:20.070> right<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.490> way<00:03:20.580> out

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
so far and then zoom right the way out

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
so far and then zoom right the way out
so<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.209> see<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.080> I'll<00:03:22.170> show<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.410> what

further<00:04:39.330> forward<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:41.180> down<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.900> where

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
further forward and down that is where

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.230 
further forward and down that is where
that<00:04:46.200> perspex<00:04:46.800> rod<00:04:46.890> just<00:04:47.460> comes<00:04:47.730> up<00:04:47.970> through

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that perspex rod just comes up through

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.850 
that perspex rod just comes up through
that<00:04:48.270> hole<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:49.520> sits<00:04:50.520> on<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:50.970> pin

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
that hole and sits on that pin

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.370 
that hole and sits on that pin
beautifully<00:04:53.510> so<00:04:54.510> all<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.020> weight<00:04:55.170> at<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
beautifully so all of the weight at the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.230 
beautifully so all of the weight at the
moment<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.100> craft<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.550> supported<00:04:57.090> through

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
moment of the craft is supported through

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.810 
moment of the craft is supported through
that<00:04:58.140> little<00:04:58.290> bit<00:04:58.470> of<00:04:58.590> resin<00:04:58.950> I'm<00:04:59.310> probably

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
that little bit of resin I'm probably

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.610 
that little bit of resin I'm probably
going<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> build<00:05:00.390> some<00:05:00.600> green<00:05:00.840> stuff<00:05:01.170> up<00:05:01.350> into

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
going to build some green stuff up into

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.300 
going to build some green stuff up into
these<00:05:01.920> corners<00:05:02.250> here<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.850> here<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.830> give

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
these corners here and here just to give

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.110 
these corners here and here just to give
this<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.550> bit<00:05:05.790> more<00:05:05.970> support<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.510> this<00:05:06.690> pin<00:05:06.960> and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
this a bit more support on this pin and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.000 
this a bit more support on this pin and
as<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> said<00:05:09.510> over<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.110> top<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.590> section

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
as I said over the top of this section

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.150 
as I said over the top of this section
at<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.250> back<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.870> engine<00:05:13.590> plate<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:13.950> gonna

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
at the back this engine plate is gonna

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.130 
at the back this engine plate is gonna
go<00:05:14.250> up<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:14.730> roof<00:05:15.030> plate<00:05:15.300> from<00:05:15.540> the<00:05:15.600> front<00:05:15.930> is

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
go up this roof plate from the front is

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.800 
go up this roof plate from the front is
going<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.350> go<00:05:16.500> in<00:05:17.270> once<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.420> trim<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:18.690> down

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
going to go in once I trim it down

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.710 
going to go in once I trim it down
properly<00:05:19.230> it's<00:05:19.590> not<00:05:20.000> all<00:05:21.000> where<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.420> needs<00:05:21.570> to

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
properly it's not all where it needs to

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.830 
properly it's not all where it needs to
be<00:05:21.840> at<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:21.990> moment<00:05:23.030> get<00:05:24.030> in<00:05:24.240> there<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.810> that

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
be at the moment get in there so that

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.190 
be at the moment get in there so that
when<00:05:28.020> you've<00:05:28.140> got<00:05:28.170> the<00:05:28.380> top<00:05:28.590> off<00:05:30.080> what<00:05:31.080> you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
when you've got the top off what you

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.910 
when you've got the top off what you
will<00:05:31.320> see<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.670> inside<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.470> all<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.800> this

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
will see in the inside so all of this

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.790 
will see in the inside so all of this
lovely<00:05:35.610> detail<00:05:36.860> from<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.040> cockpit<00:05:39.560> which<00:05:40.560> is

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
lovely detail from the cockpit which is

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.390 
lovely detail from the cockpit which is
just<00:05:41.370> there<00:05:41.700> right<00:05:44.450> through<00:05:45.450> back<00:05:46.170> here<00:05:46.620> I've

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
just there right through back here I've

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.980 
just there right through back here I've
got<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.640> straighten<00:05:47.970> this<00:05:48.090> bit<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.420> detail<00:05:48.750> out

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
got to straighten this bit of detail out

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
got to straighten this bit of detail out
cuz<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.920> gets<00:05:50.130> heated<00:05:51.060> up<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.450> warm<00:05:52.010> through

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
cuz it gets heated up and warm through

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.090 
cuz it gets heated up and warm through
to<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.280> engine<00:05:53.580> section<00:05:54.000> at<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.180> back<00:05:54.330> and

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
to the engine section at the back and

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.770 
to the engine section at the back and
then<00:05:56.100> when<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.340> want<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:56.580> look<00:05:56.820> at<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.210> detail

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
then when you want to look at the detail

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.630 
then when you want to look at the detail
in<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.020> bottom<00:05:58.320> this<00:05:59.070> is<00:05:59.130> all<00:05:59.370> going<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.550> be

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
in the bottom this is all going to be

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.010 
in the bottom this is all going to be
stuck<00:05:59.820> together<00:05:59.970> so<00:06:00.450> you'll<00:06:00.600> be<00:06:00.690> able<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.930> look

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
stuck together so you'll be able to look

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.880 
stuck together so you'll be able to look
through<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:01.380> front<00:06:01.650> hatch<00:06:02.520> which<00:06:02.850> will<00:06:03.030> open

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
through the front hatch which will open

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.760 
through the front hatch which will open
so<00:06:04.890> next<00:06:05.490> part<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.820> this<00:06:05.940> project<00:06:06.470> is<00:06:07.470> getting

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
so next part of this project is getting

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.310 
so next part of this project is getting
in<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.950> modelling<00:06:08.310> plaster<00:06:08.670> out<00:06:09.320> and

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
in the modelling plaster out and

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.910 
in the modelling plaster out and
building<00:06:10.650> up<00:06:10.770> some<00:06:11.040> rubble<00:06:13.040> around<00:06:14.040> the<00:06:14.730> base

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
building up some rubble around the base

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.810 
building up some rubble around the base
so<00:06:16.920> I'm<00:06:16.980> gonna<00:06:17.100> have<00:06:17.280> a<00:06:17.310> play<00:06:17.490> with<00:06:17.670> that<00:06:17.760> for

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
so I'm gonna have a play with that for

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.110 
so I'm gonna have a play with that for
you<00:06:18.090> now<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.930> so<00:06:22.560> after<00:06:23.100> attacking<00:06:23.790> it<00:06:24.090> with

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
you now and so after attacking it with

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.530 
you now and so after attacking it with
some<00:06:24.510> modelling<00:06:24.900> plaster<00:06:26.090> built<00:06:27.090> up<00:06:27.300> some

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
some modelling plaster built up some

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.410 
some modelling plaster built up some
rubble<00:06:27.840> around<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.290> base<00:06:29.060> thrown<00:06:30.060> in<00:06:30.180> some

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
rubble around the base thrown in some

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.630 
rubble around the base thrown in some
cut<00:06:30.990> up<00:06:31.020> bits<00:06:31.380> of<00:06:31.530> buildings<00:06:34.310> popped<00:06:35.310> a<00:06:35.400> bit<00:06:35.550> of

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
cut up bits of buildings popped a bit of

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.130 
cut up bits of buildings popped a bit of
rubble<00:06:35.880> on<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.030> top<00:06:36.300> of<00:06:36.450> the<00:06:36.540> structures<00:06:36.990> as

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
rubble on the top of the structures as

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.250 
rubble on the top of the structures as
well<00:06:37.320> up<00:06:37.740> here<00:06:38.390> down<00:06:39.390> in<00:06:39.600> this<00:06:39.750> corner<00:06:40.140> to

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
well up here down in this corner to

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.659 
well up here down in this corner to
build<00:06:40.470> that<00:06:40.650> up

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
build that up

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:50.809 
build that up
and<00:06:43.060> we<00:06:43.180> have<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.360> thoroughly<00:06:45.599> ruined<00:06:46.599> building

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.040 

which<00:06:51.819> my<00:06:52.060> Thunderhawk<00:06:52.539> is<00:06:52.719> going<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:52.960> be

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
which my Thunderhawk is going to be

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.050 
which my Thunderhawk is going to be
coming<00:06:53.349> in<00:06:54.029> over<00:06:55.029> the<00:06:55.150> top<00:06:55.330> of<00:06:56.580> so<00:06:57.580> hopefully<00:06:57.999> I

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
coming in over the top of so hopefully I

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.550 
coming in over the top of so hopefully I
have<00:06:58.210> a<00:06:58.240> bit<00:06:58.419> more<00:06:58.539> success<00:06:58.930> with<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.169> plaster

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
have a bit more success with the plaster

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.230 
have a bit more success with the plaster
this<00:06:59.710> time<00:06:59.949> than<00:07:00.249> the<00:07:00.340> last<00:07:00.520> time<00:07:00.729> I<00:07:00.789> used<00:07:01.090> it

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
this time than the last time I used it

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.749 
this time than the last time I used it
it<00:07:01.360> was<00:07:01.389> very<00:07:01.509> crumbly<00:07:02.080> very<00:07:02.349> flaky<00:07:02.650> so<00:07:03.219> I<00:07:03.669> took

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 
it was very crumbly very flaky so I took

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.839 
it was very crumbly very flaky so I took
some<00:07:04.120> advice<00:07:04.419> from<00:07:04.770> good<00:07:05.770> old<00:07:05.949> Templars

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
some advice from good old Templars
