00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250 
who are watching enjoying it and that
was<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> played<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> game<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.900> tried<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
was the way I played the game I tried to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.420 
was the way I played the game I tried to
be<00:01:07.350> aggressive<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:08.220> wanted<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> win<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:10.430> learned

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
be aggressive I wanted to win I learned

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
be aggressive I wanted to win I learned
to<00:01:11.700> accept<00:01:12.180> defeat<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to accept defeat but you don't have to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.390 
to accept defeat but you don't have to
enjoy<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.799> competitive

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
enjoy it and I was very very competitive

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
enjoy it and I was very very competitive
and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.180> lot<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> public

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and I think that a lot of the public

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
and I think that a lot of the public
come<00:01:19.530> along<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:19.979> save<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> money<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
come along they save a lot of money to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.390 
come along they save a lot of money to
go<00:01:21.000> along<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.479> events<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.590> think

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
go along to these events and I think

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
go along to these events and I think
they<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.420> entertained<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they want to be entertained and they

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.020 
they want to be entertained and they
want<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.100> passion<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> aggression

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
want to see some passion and aggression

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020 
want to see some passion and aggression
and<00:01:27.330> maybe<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.740> saw<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> terms

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and maybe that's what they saw in terms

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.630 
and maybe that's what they saw in terms
of<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.360> record<00:01:31.200> incredible<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> highest
