00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 welcome welcome or welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.510
 another video more than the ordinary life 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.599
 and 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.730
 Today I'm going to show you how it should be 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.550
 clean an earring when you first 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.820
 you just did with jug water 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.800
 Baas moisten a cotton swab or gauze and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.970
 you're going to start cleaning around 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.849
 the piercing without being too rough if you can 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.129
 give it back I recommend it in my case 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.190
 you can not then foam with 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.400
 a neutral soap you are going to place the foam 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.500
 in the arete or floor you're going to cover 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.329
 alright fine alright then you're going to rinse 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.400
 well that soap I think they have resided 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.320
 once you've done all that you're going to 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.379
 put a cup in the microwave you're going to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 heat for about 40 seconds or if not 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.330
 the villages what hot in a pot 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.489
 but that is lukewarm you are going to put a 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.949
 quarter teaspoon of sea salt and what 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.799
 you're going to stir well then you're going to get wet 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.100
 another cotonete or another gauze and you're going to cover 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.369
 well all the spaces in the piercing 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 that's so it heals a little more 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 fast and protect him as evangelists 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.210
 and it would be all very easy as 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.820
 probable is that a kind 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.189
 like it 's not bush but it's like a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.380
 liquid is medium viscous medium 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 yellowish is not completely yellow 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 this is normal that is the one that is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 scarring do not overdo it with water 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.819
 the fairies do not exceed that is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.640
 cleaning selo followed in once a day 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.340
 or maybe two depending on how much 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 Well, this one is like in contact with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 dirt do not move abruptly in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.679
 waves spin you do not see it I know very well the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.599
 hands before you start with the cleaned and 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.880
 any anomaly then go with a 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.189
 doctor or with the person who made them 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.110
 piercing that recommends them then a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.599
 treatment because that would be the whole video 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 very fast very simple I hope that you 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.250
