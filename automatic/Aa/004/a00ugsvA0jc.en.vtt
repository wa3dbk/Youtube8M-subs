00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
running the ball so we're going to have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.740 
running the ball so we're going to have
to<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> key<00:00:55.910> just<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> stop<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.660> in
