from the corner

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
from the corner
uh<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.540> reasoning<00:00:42.989> reasoning<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.710> didn't

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
uh it was reasoning reasoning I didn't

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.260 
uh it was reasoning reasoning I didn't
want<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.250> thrown<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:44.910> walked

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
want to get thrown out so I just walked

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
want to get thrown out so I just walked
away<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> bench<00:00:46.020> cuz<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:47.100> maybe

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
away from the bench cuz I was maybe

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
away from the bench cuz I was maybe
gonna<00:00:47.550> choke<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> referee<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> figured<00:00:49.620> I'd

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
gonna choke a referee so I figured I'd

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.760 
gonna choke a referee so I figured I'd
walk<00:00:49.890> away<00:00:50.070> before<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.640> did<00:00:50.820> something<00:00:51.180> stupid

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
walk away before I did something stupid

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
walk away before I did something stupid
did<00:00:52.770> any<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.219> players<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:54.059> anything

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
did any of your players do anything

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
did any of your players do anything
stupid<00:00:55.550> no<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.030> frustration

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
stupid no I think there was frustration

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
stupid no I think there was frustration
certainly<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.320> our<00:00:58.440> players<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
certainly from our players you know and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.779 
certainly from our players you know and
you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.199> zeros<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you know I don't think it's zeros is a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
you know I don't think it's zeros is a
red<00:01:03.149> card<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> Dempsey<00:01:04.409> obviously

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
red card you know and Dempsey obviously

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
red card you know and Dempsey obviously
is<00:01:05.189> reaction<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.049> but

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is reaction you know was what it was but

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
is reaction you know was what it was but
on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:08.040> token<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.689> when

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
on the same token you know you know when

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
on the same token you know you know when
a<00:01:09.900> linesman<00:01:10.320> tells<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.880> goals<00:01:12.119> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a linesman tells you that the goals not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.240 
a linesman tells you that the goals not
offsides<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.350> defender<00:01:13.799> played<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
offsides because our defender played the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
offsides because our defender played the
ball<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> guy<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.900> looked<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
ball to the guy it looked to me like it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
ball to the guy it looked to me like it
was<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> shot<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.340> deflected<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.939> guys

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
was a shot that got deflected you guys

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.850 
was a shot that got deflected you guys
saw<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.900> maybe<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
saw the game and maybe you have the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
saw the game and maybe you have the
benefit<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> seeing<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> replay<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.479> tell

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
benefit of seeing a replay but you tell

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.969 
benefit of seeing a replay but you tell
me<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> Dylan<00:01:22.320> Remmick<00:01:22.590> played<00:01:22.799> him<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
me that Dylan Remmick played him the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.840 
me that Dylan Remmick played him the
ball<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:26.490> seemed<00:01:26.729> like

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
ball I don't think so it seemed like

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
ball I don't think so it seemed like
even<00:01:27.090> early<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.840> guys<00:01:28.110> were<00:01:28.290> frustrated

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
even early on just guys were frustrated

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
even early on just guys were frustrated
and<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.340> felt<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.610> even<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and it just felt like even from the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
and it just felt like even from the
15,000<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.890> sort<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.130> building<00:01:32.520> towards

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
15,000 it was sort of building towards

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
15,000 it was sort of building towards
him<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.090> could<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> sense<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> even<00:01:34.290> even<00:01:34.979> in

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
him I could you sense that even even in

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
him I could you sense that even even in
the<00:01:35.130> early<00:01:35.340> minutes<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> mean

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the early minutes it was you know I mean

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
the early minutes it was you know I mean
I<00:01:37.020> thought<00:01:37.380> early<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> game<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.369> thought

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
I thought early on in the game I thought

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.950 
I thought early on in the game I thought
Portland<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.390> better<00:01:39.570> than<00:01:39.840> us

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Portland was a little bit better than us

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
Portland was a little bit better than us
I<00:01:40.200> found<00:01:40.799> after<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.189> 20<00:01:41.549> minutes<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.939> thought

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I found after about 20 minutes I thought
