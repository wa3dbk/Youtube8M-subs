00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
how do you think the game when we lost

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.820 
how do you think the game when we lost
2-1<00:00:02.580> but<00:00:03.030> we<00:00:03.179> came<00:00:03.570> back<00:00:03.750> stronger<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.440> second

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
2-1 but we came back stronger and second

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.870 
2-1 but we came back stronger and second
up<00:00:04.950> something<00:00:05.400> um<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:07.130> was<00:00:08.130> not<00:00:08.340> pleased<00:00:08.639> at<00:00:08.820> all

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
up something um I was not pleased at all

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.049 
up something um I was not pleased at all
at<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.269> first<00:00:09.480> 30<00:00:09.719> minutes<00:00:10.610> we<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.759> played<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
at the first 30 minutes we have played a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.209 
at the first 30 minutes we have played a
couple<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.509> good<00:00:12.690> games<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.170> Manila<00:00:13.710> today

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
couple of good games in Manila today

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.760 
couple of good games in Manila today
would<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.429> more<00:00:14.849> difficult<00:00:15.379> during<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.500> time

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
would be more difficult during this time

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.290 
would be more difficult during this time
I<00:00:17.270> felt<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.420> want<00:00:19.789> aggressive<00:00:20.789> enough<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I felt we want aggressive enough and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.439 
I felt we want aggressive enough and
involved<00:00:22.140> enough<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:24.000> happy<00:00:24.210> with

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
involved enough so I was not happy with

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
involved enough so I was not happy with
that<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.230> got<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.680> better<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.880> last

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that it got a little better on the last

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
that it got a little better on the last
15<00:00:27.449> minutes<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.080> half<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.490> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
15 minutes of the first half of this is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
15 minutes of the first half of this is
what<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:29.910> talked<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.599> fun<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
what we talked about it have fun and I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.520 
what we talked about it have fun and I
think<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.679> proved<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> second<00:00:33.059> half<00:00:33.210> that

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
think we proved in the second half that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.010 
think we proved in the second half that
when<00:00:34.530> everyone<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> committed<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.450> going

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
when everyone is committed in going

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
when everyone is committed in going
together<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> always<00:00:38.940> give

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
together then we can always give

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.310 
together then we can always give
ourselves<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.480> chance<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.020> thought<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
ourselves a chance and I thought the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.010 
ourselves a chance and I thought the
second<00:00:40.620> half<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:41.040> periods<00:00:41.340> quit<00:00:41.670> football<00:00:42.020> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
second half had periods quit football so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.250 
second half had periods quit football so
we<00:00:43.140> take<00:00:43.290> away<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.590> lesson<00:00:44.840> but<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.110> must

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we take away a lesson but now we must

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
we take away a lesson but now we must
always<00:00:47.100> believed<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.510> way<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.780> train

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
always believed that the way we train

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
always believed that the way we train
every<00:00:49.230> day<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> ability<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
every day and the ability that we have

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.920 
every day and the ability that we have
to<00:00:52.170> play<00:00:52.350> football<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> we

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to play football it has to be that we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
to play football it has to be that we
trust<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.340> trust<00:00:56.340> each<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.910> hopefully

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
trust this trust each other so hopefully

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
trust this trust each other so hopefully
it's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> good<00:00:57.840> lesson

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.730 

we<00:01:08.400> only<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.270> from<00:01:09.720> Los<00:01:09.960> Angeles<00:01:10.560> week

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
we only got here from Los Angeles week

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
we only got here from Los Angeles week
so<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.130> first<00:01:11.340> days<00:01:11.550> were<00:01:11.790> difficult<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so the first days were difficult of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
so the first days were difficult of
course<00:01:13.130> continues<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.280> show<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.850> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
course continues to show a little bit on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.600 
course continues to show a little bit on
today<00:01:15.480> 30<00:01:16.020> minutes<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.400> place<00:01:17.640> so

today 30 minutes with some good place so

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.970 
today 30 minutes with some good place so
continuously<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.940> days<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.270> try<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
continuously some days and try to and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.560 
continuously some days and try to and
decide<00:01:23.550> word<00:01:25.160> for<00:01:26.160> /<00:01:26.700> 30<00:01:26.940> minutes<00:01:27.300> day<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
decide word for / 30 minutes day I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
decide word for / 30 minutes day I
thought<00:01:27.810> he<00:01:27.990> had<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:29.040> quality<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.970> was

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
thought he had some quality and that was

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.150 
thought he had some quality and that was
good<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.330> see<00:01:30.510> is<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.410> other<00:01:31.560> players<00:01:31.920> who

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
good to see is there other players who

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.830 
good to see is there other players who
stood<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.700> today<00:01:37.550> in<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.729> first<00:01:38.940> half<00:01:39.120> no

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
stood out today in the first half no

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.230 
stood out today in the first half no
I<00:01:40.899> think<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> second<00:01:42.399> half<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.729> saw<00:01:42.939> many

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
I think in the second half we saw many

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.480 
I think in the second half we saw many
players<00:01:43.539> days<00:01:44.200> love<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:46.719> both<00:01:47.560> Reba<00:01:48.369> and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
players days love the both Reba and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.480 
players days love the both Reba and
lethal<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.049> second<00:01:50.439> half<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.770> sunroom

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
lethal in the second half in the sunroom

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.700 
lethal in the second half in the sunroom
a<00:01:52.649> solid<00:01:54.119> often<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.210> see<00:01:55.390> how<00:01:55.990> happy<00:01:56.170> today<00:01:56.350> I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
a solid often to see how happy today I

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.459 
a solid often to see how happy today I
think<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:58.390> was<00:01:58.539> a<00:01:58.569> period<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.259> first

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
think there was a period in the first

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.789 
think there was a period in the first
half<00:01:59.619> where<00:01:59.860> Morgan<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:01.719> trying<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.289> do<00:02:02.619> so

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
half where Morgan was trying to do so

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.709 
half where Morgan was trying to do so
much<00:02:02.979> was<00:02:03.219> running<00:02:03.490> everywhere<00:02:03.729> lost<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
much was running everywhere lost a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.759 
much was running everywhere lost a
little<00:02:04.959> bit<00:02:05.079> focus<00:02:05.469> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.880> he<00:02:07.679> sort<00:02:08.679> of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
little bit focus I think he sort of

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.499 
little bit focus I think he sort of
rearrange<00:02:09.220> them<00:02:09.399> self<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.729> happened<00:02:10.119> after<00:02:10.360> we

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
rearrange them self I happened after we

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.190 
rearrange them self I happened after we
spoke<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:12.220> me<00:02:12.549> was<00:02:12.819> or<00:02:13.030> wasn't<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.989> thought

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
spoke so me was or wasn't and I thought

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.140 
spoke so me was or wasn't and I thought
serene<00:02:14.500> came<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:14.920> field<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.489> for<00:02:15.970> 30

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
serene came on the field and for 30

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.770 
serene came on the field and for 30
minutes<00:02:16.390> help<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:18.120> certainly<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.329> saw<00:02:19.540> some

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
minutes help so certainly we saw some

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.300 
minutes help so certainly we saw some
improvement<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.470> that's<00:02:20.769> what<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.069> have<00:02:21.099> to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
improvement and that's what we have to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.459 
improvement and that's what we have to
go
