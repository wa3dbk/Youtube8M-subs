00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
of floating off by themselves if you

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.390 
of floating off by themselves if you
pull<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.809> who<00:00:15.990> knows<00:00:16.109> it'll<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> gap<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.279> we

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
pull this who knows it'll be a gap so we

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.150 
pull this who knows it'll be a gap so we
got<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.730> clean<00:00:17.970> these<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.590> I'm<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:19.800> going

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
for so we can actually see that we're

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.939 
for so we can actually see that we're
not<00:00:23.330> selecting<00:00:24.500> three<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.710> make<00:00:25.920> sure

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
not selecting three of them make sure

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
not selecting three of them make sure
it's<00:00:26.189> only<00:00:26.340> two<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:27.359> if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> select

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's only two because if you select

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.200 
it's only two because if you select
three<00:00:28.199> they'll<00:00:28.410> emerge<00:00:28.619> them<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:28.949> together

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
three they'll emerge them all together

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so I'm going to go to my edit mesh and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
so I'm going to go to my edit mesh and
you<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> merge<00:00:34.110> make<00:00:34.500> sure<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.770> open<00:00:35.130> up

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.110 
you see the merge make sure you open up
this<00:00:35.460> dialog<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.210> squeeze<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.460> 1.4

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this dialog and squeeze out to be 1.4

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.450 
this dialog and squeeze out to be 1.4
and<00:00:39.739> hit<00:00:40.739> merge<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.800> let<00:00:44.309> go

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460

ok so I'm going to go to side view work
with<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.800> geometry<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:00.610> have<00:04:00.970> we're

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
with the geometry that I have we're

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:21.209 
with the geometry that I have we're
trying<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.320> make<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.530> curve<00:04:02.950> right<00:04:03.130> here<00:04:04.110> aww

and our key em pull them up high so we

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.450 
and our key em pull them up high so we
can<00:04:37.520> actually<00:04:38.030> split<00:04:38.449> in<00:04:38.660> this<00:04:38.780> area<00:04:42.370> here<00:04:43.370> we

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
can actually split in this area here we

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.150 
can actually split in this area here we
go

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160
