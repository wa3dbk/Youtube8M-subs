 Hello everyone, so we continue the topic nodes and 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.600
 I want to warn you that this video will 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.670
 used terminology which 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.219
 was considered in the previous video about 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.289
 structural elements of the node who did not look 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.760
 This video please read to 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.369
 there were no further questions 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.830
 terminology and so the first node which 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.140
 we consider this simple node which 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.260
 consists of two semi knots as we remember 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.870
 semi knot is single 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.059
 overlap of the two ends of the rope 2 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.809
 overlap ie 2 full nodes forms 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.000
 simple knot 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.680
 I hope everyone recognized him this knot and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.110
 widely used in everyday life as for 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.210
 tying around a prop so for sleep 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.579
 debate the rope in the crevice and either in 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.989
 hole and another nodule which we 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.520
 consider in this same video for the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.879
 the simple reason that it consists of two 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.719
 simple nodes this is a direct node also 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.430
 it's called reef knot knot 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.010
 used to tie two ropes 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.070
 together or two ends of the same rope 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.619
 together the node is if you look closely 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.899
 of two open loops which are somewhere 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.369
 each other's what they are so free 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.840
 move relative to each other and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.249
 says that the node can 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.439
 use only with static 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:16.850
 load at dynamic load node 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.060
 may be weakened and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.560
 unleash spontaneously so the knot 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.950
 should be used only in household 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.229
 purposes 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.810
 on static load the node holds 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.389
 very good as regards correctness 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.490
 tying a knot then indicators 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.439
 correctly connected node is that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.950
 make these ropes go out with one 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.679
 sides of the loop on the left we see 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.569
 the same as for wrong 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.389
 knotted it is very similar to 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:48.380
 straight knot but called babi knot and 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:51.229
 This node does not hold the load because 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.189
 due to his asymmetry he begins 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.569
 turn around and crawling such a node is not 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.700
 it is advisable to use at all 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.189
 any purposes and in terms of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.079
 knot strength and in terms of aesthetics 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.189
 kind of and so repeat correctly 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.190
 tying a knot two ropes go out 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.890
 one side of the loop on it all thanks 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.810
 for watching subscribe to the channel in 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.210
 The following videos will be even more interesting and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 who liked to like all 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.680
 Good to see you in the new videos for now
