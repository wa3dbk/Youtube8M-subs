00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.140
 since the launch of kinect several developers different customs 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.879
 applications for the peripheral 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.789
 one of them is the alckmin haul revolution has given application to use the kinect 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.980
 how bad in luanda the service 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.560
 we are suffering and you confess our intentions now you are 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
 the ine in resex and three other factors that must be installed beforehand 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.679
 it is also worth mentioning 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.850
 it is not free and requires the purchase of a use license after all 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.880
 state the user connects kinect on ps 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.040
 according to developers the peripheral should stay up to 15 centimeters above or 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.970
 below the monitors the reach I know of six inches and three and a half meters 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.720
 iran does not have the capacity yet 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.600
 the output of it is a control station that must be kept always open 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.360
 the user to position themselves ahead of the native kinect suffer with a tablet 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.110
 to the side the forward 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 if it moves away from the peripheral for a few seconds 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 it is disabled until someone the gunner again 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 the drive five times until it responds well 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.540
 but the movements must be slow that quite expressive 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.800
 commenting on the fall in the interval 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 the mouse and moves faster 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.050
 because the latter only on larger screens 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.410
 Click is a critical problem 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.370
 The priority is to throw the ball forward but this movement is extremely 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.760
 imprecise 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880
 many mistakes happen 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 omar asad instead of clicking here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.240
 with little time of use the orange realizes that the resolution of the screen bÃª 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 will be reduced to ease problems with a click 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.650
 even so he needs to be patient and experienced to do it only went 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 discovery minimally correct way 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.719
 the inventory 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.010
 it is quite inaccurate 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.420
 with one stretched for about two seconds 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.500
 the active mode 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.839
 the hand looks like it represents the left mouse button 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.549
 and to the right the right button 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.729
 up and down have seen the leithead keys since then 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.659
 the only positive point of motovigia 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.939
 is that it explains this impasse really get easier 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.269
 but it does not improve holding windows as it promises 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.609
 is not at all intuitive to resize or perform tasks 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.969
 specific settings in the 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.159
 in theory or age interacts with browsers that some softwares 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.299
 through expressive gestures but only in the theory 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.729
 one of the best examples is google earth 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.599
 working with a phrase can be a lot of fun with gesture features but 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.159
 not with the unspeakable you recognize that this place that appears in the video 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.069
 neither do we 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.269
 we stopped there the controls of the partners wanted so 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.059
 on the positive side 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.059
 at least you're going to lose some random geography 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.209
 to summarize the story willian is still far from being a program 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.199
 interesting for windows 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.619
 far away 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:12.659
 the program that is inaccurate and will not change the life of any user 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.759
 in short time of use is enough to tire the arms 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.889
 the drive needs to be slow 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.459
 and yet it is stable 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.329
 the clips just a disaster the exploitation of windows is practically impossible 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:32.929
 but this may still change this year Microsoft promises to wear the suits 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:37.139
 to create new and better programs for kinect 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.029
 expects to have really efficient captives 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:42.949
 only one patient
