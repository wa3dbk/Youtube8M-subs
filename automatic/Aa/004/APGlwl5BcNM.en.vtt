00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
have gotten the reference anyway i just

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.450 
have gotten the reference anyway i just
realized<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.200> i<00:00:13.230> never<00:00:13.559> thought<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:13.950> how

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
realized that i never thought about how

the<00:00:14.519> bones<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.540> skeleton<00:00:16.109> actually<00:00:16.529> work

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the bones in my skeleton actually work

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.170 
the bones in my skeleton actually work
for<00:00:17.520> example<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:18.359> i<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> long<00:00:19.529> run<00:00:19.890> or<00:00:20.189> if

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
for example if i go for a long run or if

I<00:00:21.420> overdo<00:00:21.930> my<00:00:22.109> wild<00:00:22.529> dance<00:00:22.800> moves<00:00:23.279> then<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.359> leg

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
I overdo my wild dance moves then my leg

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140 
I overdo my wild dance moves then my leg
bones<00:00:24.990> must<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.470> overloaded<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> may<00:00:27.119> even

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
bones must be overloaded and may even

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.349 
bones must be overloaded and may even
sustain<00:00:28.019> tiny<00:00:28.380> amounts<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> damage<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:30.179> how

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
sustain tiny amounts of damage but how

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
sustain tiny amounts of damage but how
is<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.599> damage<00:00:31.199> sensed<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.550> must<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.940> some

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
is that damage sensed there must be some

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.590 
is that damage sensed there must be some
cells<00:00:33.480> involved<00:00:34.160> but<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.370> cells<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.149> what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
cells involved but which cells and what

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260 
cells involved but which cells and what
are<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.989> doing<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.520> lie<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
are they doing I need to lie down and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930 
are they doing I need to lie down and
think<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.730> i<00:00:41.760> normally

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
think about this this is what i normally

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.690 
think about this this is what i normally
imagine<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:42.989> i<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> bone<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.550> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
imagine when i think of a bone but they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
imagine when i think of a bone but they
surely<00:00:44.969> don't<00:00:45.390> start<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.289> way<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.620> where

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
surely don't start out this way so where

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180 
surely don't start out this way so where

lining<00:01:22.229> cells<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:23.159> let's<00:01:23.790> turn<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.390> around

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
so if you have over exercised perhaps

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.389 
so if you have over exercised perhaps
you<00:01:30.969> run<00:01:31.210> marathons<00:01:31.780> take<00:01:32.409> part<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.920> military

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399

trying to answer that very question they

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.550 
trying to answer that very question they

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.339 
believe that it goes back to the
well-connected<00:02:19.069> osteocyte<00:02:19.910> network<00:02:20.690> watch

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
well-connected osteocyte network watch

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.710 
well-connected osteocyte network watch
as<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.099> little<00:02:22.400> red<00:02:22.580> signal<00:02:23.060> goes<00:02:23.299> from<00:02:23.510> one

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
as the little red signal goes from one

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.980 
as the little red signal goes from one
osteocyte<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.620> another

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.310 

the<00:02:30.890> signals<00:02:31.370> go<00:02:31.790> between<00:02:32.150> these<00:02:32.330> cells<00:02:32.630> but

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
the signals go between these cells but

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.890 
the signals go between these cells but
can<00:02:33.530> also<00:02:33.650> travel<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.460> where<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.900> osteoclasts

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
can also travel to where the osteoclasts

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.650 
can also travel to where the osteoclasts
live<00:02:36.170> thus<00:02:36.740> can<00:02:37.070> call<00:02:37.340> them<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.760> damage<00:02:38.150> sites

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
live thus can call them to damage sites

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.800 
live thus can call them to damage sites
well<00:02:39.410> Hugh<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.370> hope<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.910> understand<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.630> little

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
well Hugh I hope you understand a little

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.680 
well Hugh I hope you understand a little
more<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.340> fascinating<00:02:44.060> way<00:02:44.270> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
more now about the fascinating way the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.650 
more now about the fascinating way the
bones<00:02:44.960> in<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.350> skeleton<00:02:46.130> work<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.730> must<00:02:47.450> go

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
bones in your skeleton work I must go

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
bones in your skeleton work I must go
now<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.680> around

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.920 

wow<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.629> feel<00:02:53.410> very<00:02:53.680> enlightened<00:02:54.370> now<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:55.420> ORS

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
wow I feel very enlightened now the ORS

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.020 
wow I feel very enlightened now the ORS
certainly<00:02:56.500> does<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> lot<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.069> great<00:02:57.310> work<00:02:57.340> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
certainly does a lot of great work I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.869 
certainly does a lot of great work I
hope<00:02:58.569> they<00:02:58.780> continue<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.890> goodbye
