00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to go just things to watch is the power

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
to go just things to watch is the power
lead<00:01:34.799> itself<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> glass<00:01:36.329> gets<00:01:36.509> hot

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
lead itself because the glass gets hot

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
lead itself because the glass gets hot
it<00:01:37.259> shouldn't<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.829> touching<00:01:38.040> anywhere<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it shouldn't be touching anywhere on the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
it shouldn't be touching anywhere on the
glass<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.049> actual<00:01:40.350> insulated<00:01:40.829> part

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
glass there is an actual insulated part

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
glass there is an actual insulated part
of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> cable<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> bit

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
of the cable right there so that's a bit

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
of the cable right there so that's a bit
of<00:01:42.689> protection<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.130> should

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
of protection but just think you should

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
of protection but just think you should
watch<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
watch out for that now we're going to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.039 
watch out for that now we're going to
set<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.470> thing<00:01:46.649> off<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.070> 180<00:01:48.049> cooking

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
set this thing off to 180 cooking

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.310 
set this thing off to 180 cooking
cooking<00:01:49.770> temperature<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
cooking temperature and because it we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.600 
cooking temperature and because it we
expect<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:53.070> an<00:01:53.189> hour<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> half's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
expect about an hour and a half's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.800 
expect about an hour and a half's
cooking<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.450> costing<00:01:54.600> only

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
cooking time but you're costing only

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
cooking time but you're costing only
doing<00:01:55.110> 60<00:01:55.470> minute<00:01:56.070> segments<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.729> isn't<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
doing 60 minute segments which isn't a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.100 
doing 60 minute segments which isn't a
bad<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.149> because<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bad thing because you can come back and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
bad thing because you can come back and
see<00:01:58.229> what's<00:01:58.380> been<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.799> and<00:02:01.700> okay<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
see what's been going on and okay the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.399 
see what's been going on and okay the
clock's<00:02:03.060> tickin<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> why<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
clock's tickin but it's not on why is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.660 
clock's tickin but it's not on why is
that<00:02:04.560> well<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.399> there's<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> little

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that well because there's a little

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.819 
that well because there's a little
safety<00:02:05.939> feature<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.659> which<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> lid

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
safety feature here which is the lid

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.309 
safety feature here which is the lid
there<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.119> lid<00:02:09.539> has<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> completely

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
there you go lid has to be completely

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.040 
there you go lid has to be completely
closed<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.700> lead<00:02:11.849> comes<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.300> any<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
closed that lead comes up in any way the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.340 
closed that lead comes up in any way the
power

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
power

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.820 
power
will<00:02:13.560> not<00:02:13.740> come<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.080> thing<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.410> found<00:02:16.560> about

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
will not come on so thing we found about

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
will not come on so thing we found about
this<00:02:16.920> oven<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.760> no<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.660> cook<00:02:18.960> quicker

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
this oven is it no is it cook quicker

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.900 
this oven is it no is it cook quicker
but<00:02:19.860> also<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:21.450> uses<00:02:21.870> less<00:02:22.410> power<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.580> if

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
but also it also uses less power so if

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.030 
but also it also uses less power so if
you're<00:02:24.330> expecting<00:02:24.690> something<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.530> 200

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you're expecting something to be at 200

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.380 
you're expecting something to be at 200
you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.610> say<00:02:26.850> at<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.210> 180<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> as

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you can put it say at about 180 so as

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470 
you can put it say at about 180 so as
you<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.600> see<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.260> oven<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.800> quite<00:02:32.700> right<00:02:33.060> no

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
you can see the oven is quite right no

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.970 
you can see the oven is quite right no
lights<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> kitchen<00:02:34.200> itself<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
lights on in the kitchen itself here and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.430 
lights on in the kitchen itself here and
inside<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> lid<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.810> fan<00:02:40.140> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
inside the lid there is a fan and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
inside the lid there is a fan and
obviously<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.130> halogen<00:02:41.520> light<00:02:41.670> itself<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
obviously the halogen light itself and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110 
obviously the halogen light itself and
that's<00:02:43.020> basically<00:02:43.320> what<00:02:43.680> he'd<00:02:43.860> sit<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:44.910> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that's basically what he'd sit as it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.430 
that's basically what he'd sit as it
gets<00:02:45.270> up<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.450> temperature<00:02:46.020> which<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> does

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
gets up to temperature which it does

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.520 
gets up to temperature which it does
very<00:02:46.650> quickly<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.320> see

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
very quickly it will then as you can see

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
very quickly it will then as you can see
turn<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.860> light<00:02:50.010> off<00:02:50.090> halogen<00:02:51.090> off<00:02:51.210> because

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
turn the light off halogen off because

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
turn the light off halogen off because
the<00:02:51.780> temperature<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.260> reached<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.430> if<00:02:53.550> it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
the temperature is reached and if it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.570 
the temperature is reached and if it
needs<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.000> boost<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> back<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.810> again<00:02:55.340> it'll<00:02:56.340> do

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
needs to boost it back up again it'll do

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.380 
needs to boost it back up again it'll do
just<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:58.370> another<00:02:59.370> advantage<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.030> oven

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
just that another advantage of this oven

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.350 
just that another advantage of this oven
is<00:03:01.130> because<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.250> where<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> potatoes<00:03:03.330> were

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
is because of where the potatoes were

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.270 
is because of where the potatoes were
we've<00:03:03.930> added<00:03:04.080> some<00:03:04.200> olive<00:03:04.470> oil<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.980> them<00:03:05.100> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
we've added some olive oil to them so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.560 
we've added some olive oil to them so
we've<00:03:05.370> taken<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.700> lid<00:03:05.850> off<00:03:06.000> during<00:03:06.390> cooking

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
we've taken the lid off during cooking

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.640 
we've taken the lid off during cooking
and<00:03:06.990> just<00:03:07.950> added<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.900> because<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.170> pizza

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and just added it and because it's pizza

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.460 
and just added it and because it's pizza
very<00:03:10.830> quickly<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.520> heats<00:03:11.730> restored<00:03:12.600> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
very quickly the heats restored you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.660 
very quickly the heats restored you
don't<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.710> big<00:03:13.860> loss<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.190> heat<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.550> you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
don't have a big loss of heat like you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.610 
don't have a big loss of heat like you
would<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.000> regular<00:03:15.120> oven<00:03:17.420> okay<00:03:18.420> after<00:03:18.990> one

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
would in a regular oven okay after one

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.510 
would in a regular oven okay after one
hour<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.100> 40<00:03:20.790> minutes<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.980> can<00:03:22.980> say<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
hour and 40 minutes I can say the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.570 
hour and 40 minutes I can say the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
chicken is complete and this is where a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.220 
chicken is complete and this is where a
video<00:03:26.820> doesn't<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.360> justice<00:03:27.390> because<00:03:27.900> it

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
video doesn't do it justice because it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.260 
video doesn't do it justice because it
