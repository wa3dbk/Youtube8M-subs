00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
thing it lifts crates in the
single-player<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.049> can't<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.890> GTA

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
single-player you can't do it in GTA

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.010

online are actually stationary so they

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149
