00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.020
 good guys youtube and forum crowd 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.510
 will you stay in Brazil? 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.680
 in this video I wanted to present a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.500
 tip to the consensus of a filter 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:34.239
 be used in the corner to perform a 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.989
 filtration of the water we have been 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.590
 collecting in the bush for later 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.690
 water treatment 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 you have a filter used here a lot in 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.070
 south 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:58.300
 the chimarrão pumps that are placed and 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:02.600
 tied in it so firmly too 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.500
 what his function would be to prevent 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.390
 the bran of the yerba mate ends and clogs 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.530
 the holes in the pump and locking 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.830
 chimarrão 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 these things like that and a while ago 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.650
 I was thinking about the possibility of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.050
 try to fit it or in a place of a 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 pet bottle or even in the canteen there I 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.020
 I did the actual test, just put it here. 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.180
 then I'll're shooting but 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.190
 approximately so you can see 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.200
 better and it does not disturb the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.330
 closing the canteen gives to close 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.180
 well that the cover area normally does not 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:59.450
 have a problem starting the filter and 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.630
 It's very practical to go when it's time to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.190
 collecting water directly from the source 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.190
 be of the mug in the corner 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 I found it very interesting because it is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:21.430
 a lightweight but tightly woven fabric 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.700
 his amalia then has enough of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.140
 there are remnants 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.989
 thicker residues let's say so 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.330
 to make the landing 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.769
 maybe we'll be looking more 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.150
 in detail now 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:47.459
 Good people in this filter pack have 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.590
 two units of this filter 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.660
 and the third is very resistant has a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.230
 good durability 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.110
 The only drawback of course is that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.810
 be easier to find here in the south 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.540
 this type of filter is not because of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.940
 chimarrão tradition in other regions 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.780
 of the country will really be a bit more 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.610
 complicated to find in the trade 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 but I made a mooring here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.420
 I will not leave him in the afternoon here until 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.420
 for me to release after using 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.340
 it to be the original end that would be in the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.840
 pump mate but we here 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.690
 inside the canteen and if you are with 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:45.540
 cover already open course will use the cup in 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:49.530
 corner to whole he does not lock 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.370
 water you can spill does not 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.299
 problem 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.549
 and I would give up until I did the test leave 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.519
 to drink it himself with the filter here 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:04.470
 of course if the filter has already been 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:07.380
 used has by the detail that we can and 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 clean the filter to remove or 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.560
 grandchildren is useless to fill a 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.090
 with water and at the time of drinking or 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.750
 Let's stay here at the time we 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:25.200
 reverse the flow of water will bring everyone 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:31.159
 the particles back into the mouth of the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.090
 people but it also allows the water 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:37.940
 even ingested 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.650
 with the filter in the mouth of the canteen and I 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.080
 I found it very practical to leave 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.310
 It's been a while since I was looking for 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 use in the markets here to take the test 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:55.250
 and it's really cool, it's cool. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.410
 was suspecting that what would not be the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.200
 enough size to be in here on 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:05.750
 mouth of the corner but it worked out then 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:09.470
 a tip for quick filtering in the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.880
 our waters from our encampments and 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.920
 tracks and it 's good stuff, right? 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.550
 I hope you liked the tip of this 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.460
 type of filter to use our 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.460
 cantis in our camps and touch
