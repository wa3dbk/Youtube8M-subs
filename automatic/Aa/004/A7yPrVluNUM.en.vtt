00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.420
 she is famous for her practicality and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.180
 reliability with very little time 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.199
 lost no its procure taxis her 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.449
 advise friends 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 skoda octavia really is what 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.740
 love especially in russia but perfect 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 cars do not happen and weak spots in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.770
 models of course there we took the second 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.930
 liftback generation after restyling 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.329
 2012 with a mileage of only 55 thousand 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.280
 kilometers engine 1 and 4 tess and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 seven-speed dsg robot box with 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.129
 double clutch 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.659
 physical condition is very good 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.670
 the car is still under warranty 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.530
 the seller asks for the machine seven hundred 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.659
 seventy five thousand rubles perfect 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.370
 state additional options and second 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.559
 set of rubber on the disc arguments 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.749
 high prices 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.879
 yet the Czechs are great the quality of materials 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.069
 and comfortable seating a lot of pockets 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.100
 and compartments for small things everything is done for 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:01.289
 human even full-time music is cool on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.299
 outwardly everything looks a bit dull gray 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.110
 threw nothing annoying my eye 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.450
 catch on 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 especially not for anything unless for this huge 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 box lever for me personally is not here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.800
 like two things this is a very rough seam 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 on the helm tile is not that a car is long 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.759
 warming up well 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.409
 thinks on cto vy is the norm except 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 beautiful box handles and tactile 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.799
 unpleasant seam on the steering wheel to the list 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 shortcomings add heavy with unaccustomed 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.360
 doors weak sound insulation wheel arches 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.040
 not the best visibility well, not yet the most 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 good location coasters and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.740
 ashtrays 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 but that's if you really find fault with 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.799
 the rest of the octavia is made smarter than many 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.240
 if not most competitors 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.850
 122 horsepower should not hurt 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.039
 delusion dynamics octave normal 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 although I personally think that perfect 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.210
 option for this car is gasoline 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.119
 Dina Vasin Turbo mechanics or machine 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.830
 dependence on personal preference 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.720
 by the way does the robot work well here 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.659
 snaps quickly smoothly 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.789
 no problem overall comfortable firm 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.440
 Four in Russia car comes with a package 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.720
 for bad roads and if really 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.000
 driving on those is a big plus 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.799
 but where irregularities are symbolic or 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.810
 artificial front sometimes you hear 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.060
 weak blow for example when you arrive at 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.069
 20-30 kilometers per hour 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.530
 cop owners again say 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.709
 for cto vy this is the norm trust but verify 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 we are going to service a comprehensive diagnosis 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.870
 first we look at the engine as for 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.709
 engine's main weaknesses are 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.540
 timing chain tension 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.710
 also there is a loss of bran power 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.210
 the car goes away lost 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.470
 this is due to a failure 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.750
 turbocharger relief valve 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.330
 anybody out there Ukraine trutin besides 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.700
 there is only a small tube problem 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.070
 which go from the engine radiator they 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.270
 crack begins to flow the river pliz 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.770
 then you need to sit very carefully 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.590
 because 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.750
 can be invisible and still it is difficult 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000
 warm in winter in general sometimes the car is not 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.830
 start up at idle heap appears 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.840
 extraneous noise but when the motor 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 warming up all by itself passes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 there are still complaints about the appetite for butter but 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.670
 here it is often to blame for its technical 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.590
 state 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.720
 if everything is fine more than 200 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.670
 milliliters per thousand kilometers of tess and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.180
 eat should not check now 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.760
 the box 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.130
 native probably depend a lot where 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.000
 it is said that but the main problem is 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.520
 clutch disc 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.860
 and what he fails well firstly 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.990
 he has weak resources is accurate fast 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.290
 although old in itself yes plus it 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.540
 overheats in heat and in periods of severe 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.910
 operation in traffic jams and made 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.030
 it was at least due to overheating and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.890
 on the contrary to him is it yes the car was driving because 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 quenching it also when 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.420
 stopping him can also get lucky 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.440
 so the service life is usually disk 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.490
 clutch in dng is 20 to 40 thousand 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.440
 systematic in nature are problems 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.060
 with sensitive mechatronic am in general in 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 the address of this box was so much criticism 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.300
 that the deputies even wanted to ban in 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.860
 Russia at the legislative level 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.810
 cars with dsg 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.670
 but if you look at club forms or 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.240
 just talk to those who traveled a lot 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.220
 on dsg 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.810
 There is not one example of what with 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.330
 there were no problems at all 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.500
 extremely positive emotions from them 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.360
 a couple of helpful tips 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.890
 eliminate a sharp start and not 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.959
 stand at traffic lights and traffic jams on 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.480
 brake and use the parking 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.549
 brake specifically our car to attack 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.799
 not passed clutch recently changed 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.080
 after repairing the car goes back like 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.940
 relies no signs of power loss 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.500
 in general, we really can disperse hundreds 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.930
 came out quite a bit slower 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.480
 official fuel consumption is noticeably higher 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 but in the winter in the city of 11 liters is all 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.680
 Equally very nice go to 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.240
 check the running well and follow up 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.880
 suspension suspension second pretty 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.040
 strong but 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.570
 disadvantages still have this bushings 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.340
 stabilizer is the front upper 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.980
 levers and rear levers 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.140
 there we write the bearings to 100 thousand 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.120
 run rarely live in our car 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.590
 for replacement at the stabilizer and 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.060
 front brake pads 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.270
 now check the remaining nodes 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.090
 car and sit about an electrician there 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.450
 small and small flaws often 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.490
 bulbs burn out by color numbers 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.420
 fail cigarette lighter contact 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.380
 on the headlights 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.970
 the contacts themselves but it melts and we 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.020
 faced such problems as either 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.120
 burned out the instrument panel lights and 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.220
 many break down frequently button 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
 Waka discoveries are quite small but 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.610
 unpleasant lack features you stand 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.290
 at the gas station it will end leasing 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.970
 and the owners complain about 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.070
 unpredictable rain sensor and 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.870
 tailgate design say 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.880
 when it rains outside when opening 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.770
 compartment poured water into the machines 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.240
 Russian assembly sometimes cut the threshold 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.670
 and fall off the moldings 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.490
 and of course the stove for our winter she 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.020
 too weak and the diagnostic result in 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.790
 we count now how many 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.310
 need to invest money to eliminate all 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.430
 shortcomings and what will be in the end benefit for 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.990
 compared to buying a new car 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.580
 recall our three year octavia worth 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.230
 seven hundred seventy five thousand rubles 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.140
 to put her in perfect condition 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.210
 need about 10,000 to repair the chassis 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.190
 ten more remove cosmetic defects 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.050
 in the end, the real price of the car 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.740
 will be seven hundred and ninety five thousand 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.630
 rubles 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.730
 as for buying a new car 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.720
 the dealers sell the third 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.610
 model generation 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.860
 it looks like a set with additional 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.090
 options car costs about 1 million 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.670
 200 thousand rubles 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.370
 progress is evident both outside and inside skoda 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.140
 became more powerful and faster more economical and so 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.940
 benefit when buying a used octave 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.500
 considering the money spent on repairs 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.350
 will be 400 5000 rubles 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.360
 over 90 percent owners 2 octavia 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.550
 I do not regret buying according to our statistics 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.590
 this is probably the most important record for them 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.290
 reliability practicality and price 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.150
 serious cons almost no weak stove 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.820
 crickets with time and poor staffing 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.830
 rubber is all not so serious choice on 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.780
 the aftermarket huge find need 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.730
 bundling is not difficult and 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.730
 usually it will be a bargain
