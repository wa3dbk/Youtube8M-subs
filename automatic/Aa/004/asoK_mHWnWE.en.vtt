variations no um those same positions

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
variations no um those same positions
actually<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.940> apply<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> belly<00:00:33.750> dancing<00:00:34.230> right

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
so that's just the basic variation of

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.599 
so that's just the basic variation of
the<00:03:21.069> same<00:03:21.280> thing

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.009 
so again we repeat we have position one

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.530 
so again we repeat we have position one
position<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.540> position<00:03:26.139> 3<00:03:26.919> and<00:03:27.069> position<00:03:27.939> form
