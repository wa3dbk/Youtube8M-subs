up<00:02:11.090> their<00:02:11.269> stadiums<00:02:11.689> so<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.109> we<00:02:12.409> will<00:02:12.769> be

in Poland in 2011 I think it's pretty

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.309 
in Poland in 2011 I think it's pretty
likely<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:15.230> perfect<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:15.829> the

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
likely that's perfect but the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.830
