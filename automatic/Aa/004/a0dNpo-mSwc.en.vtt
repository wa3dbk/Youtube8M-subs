here's<00:00:00.870> another<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.410> code<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.920> if<00:00:02.100> you

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
here's another the code video if you

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.980 
here's another the code video if you
haven't<00:00:02.669> played<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.090> map<00:00:03.240> yet<00:00:03.419> check<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.870> out

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
haven't played the map yet check it out

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.019 
haven't played the map yet check it out
it's<00:00:04.259> pretty<00:00:04.500> cool<00:00:04.680> but<00:00:05.250> as<00:00:05.430> always<00:00:05.640> you'll

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
it's pretty cool but as always you'll

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.030 
it's pretty cool but as always you'll
probably<00:00:06.270> watch<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.720> video<00:00:06.960> anyway<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.649> here

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
probably watch this video anyway so here

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.839 
probably watch this video anyway so here
we<00:00:08.220> go<00:00:09.469> so<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.769> little<00:00:10.950> time<00:00:11.280> machine<00:00:11.610> here

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
we go so I'm a little time machine here

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
we go so I'm a little time machine here
and<00:00:12.000> all<00:00:12.599> kinds<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> stuff<00:00:13.200> will<00:00:13.469> happen<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and all kinds of stuff will happen a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.919 
and all kinds of stuff will happen a
tree<00:00:14.429> will<00:00:14.639> grow<00:00:14.820> you'll<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> room

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
tree will grow you'll see the room

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.200 
tree will grow you'll see the room
crumble<00:00:16.410> away<00:00:16.529> you'll<00:00:17.310> also<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:17.850> fancy

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
crumble away you'll also see some fancy

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.970 
crumble away you'll also see some fancy
particles<00:00:18.779> flying<00:00:18.990> around<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.710> cloaks

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
particles flying around and the cloaks

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.390 
particles flying around and the cloaks
are<00:00:20.220> spinning<00:00:20.580> around<00:00:21.859> but<00:00:22.859> how<00:00:23.039> did<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.340> do

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
are spinning around but how did I do

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.450 
are spinning around but how did I do
this<00:00:24.320> we'll<00:00:25.320> start<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> simple<00:00:26.070> clock

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
this we'll start with a simple clock

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
this we'll start with a simple clock
that<00:00:26.760> tests<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.810> players<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.380> are

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that tests if all the players that are

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.859 
that tests if all the players that are
online<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> room<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.689> only

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
online are in the room because we only

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
online are in the room because we only
want<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.289> start<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:32.070> everybody<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
want to start when everybody is in the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.139 
want to start when everybody is in the
room<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> person<00:00:35.010> using<00:00:36.000> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
room not just one person using this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
room not just one person using this
command<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.870> test<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.440> people<00:00:37.710> are

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
command you can test if people are

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.130 
command you can test if people are
outside<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> radius<00:00:39.030> instead<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> inside

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
outside of this radius instead of inside

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.979 
outside of this radius instead of inside
like<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> usually<00:00:40.800> use<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:42.149> we'll<00:00:42.360> invert

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
like you usually use now we'll invert

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.830 
like you usually use now we'll invert
that<00:00:43.020> signal<00:00:43.770> using<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.460> redstone<00:00:44.760> torch<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that signal using a redstone torch that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
that signal using a redstone torch that
will<00:00:45.989> set<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.469> chain<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> command<00:00:47.280> books

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
will set up this chain of command books

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
will set up this chain of command books
so<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.570> there's<00:00:48.780> no<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.289> outside<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so when there's no one outside of the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.279 
so when there's no one outside of the
room<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:50.910> means<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.390> everybody<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
room which means that everybody is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.709 
room which means that everybody is
inside<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> room<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.820> redstone<00:00:54.270> torch<00:00:54.510> will

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
inside the room this redstone torch will

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.670 
inside the room this redstone torch will
turn<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.850> first<00:00:56.850> things<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:58.320> command

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
turn on first things first this command

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
turn on first things first this command
block<00:00:58.800> will<00:00:59.010> create<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> redstone<00:00:59.850> block<00:01:00.059> over

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
block will create a redstone block over

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
block will create a redstone block over
here<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.410> turns<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.160> clock<00:01:02.460> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
here that turns on this clock this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
here that turns on this clock this
command<00:01:03.420> block<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.899> add<00:01:04.080> 1500<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> time

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
command block will add 1500 to the time

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
command block will add 1500 to the time
that<00:01:06.030> will<00:01:06.150> make<00:01:06.330> these<00:01:06.570> clocks<00:01:06.900> rotate<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.590> if

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that will make these clocks rotate as if

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
that will make these clocks rotate as if
the<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> passing<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:09.000> fast<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the time is passing really fast and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
the time is passing really fast and
these<00:01:10.290> command<00:01:10.619> blocks<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:11.010> summon<00:01:11.220> slimes

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
these command blocks will summon slimes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
these command blocks will summon slimes
with<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.270> size<00:01:12.510> set<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> minus<00:01:13.530> 1<00:01:13.740> since<00:01:14.490> the

with the size set to minus 1 since the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
with the size set to minus 1 since the
health<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.180> slime<00:01:15.420> depends<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.049> its<00:01:16.229> size<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
health of a slime depends on its size it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
health of a slime depends on its size it
will<00:01:17.400> die<00:01:17.610> immediately<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.869> won't<00:01:19.080> even

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
will die immediately and you won't even

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
will die immediately and you won't even
see<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> slime<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
see a slime because this time is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.690 
see a slime because this time is
infinitely<00:01:21.869> small<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.920> creates<00:01:23.310> some<00:01:23.430> neat

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
infinitely small this creates some neat

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.109 
infinitely small this creates some neat
looking<00:01:24.030> particles<00:01:24.619> check<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.909> square<00:01:26.909> dude

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
looking particles check out square dude

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
looking particles check out square dude
he<00:01:27.659> came<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.409> technique<00:01:28.799> first<00:01:29.189> now

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
he came up with this technique first now

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
he came up with this technique first now
those<00:01:30.450> spinning<00:01:30.750> particle<00:01:31.229> thingies

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
those spinning particle thingies

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
those spinning particle thingies
these<00:01:32.640> command<00:01:33.000> blocks<00:01:33.060> set<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.990> blocks<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
these command blocks set these blocks to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
these command blocks set these blocks to
a<00:01:34.619> spawner<00:01:35.040> spawning<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.850> minecart<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a spawner spawning a minecart with a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
a spawner spawning a minecart with a
custom<00:01:36.960> block<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.009> these<00:01:38.189> minecarts

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
custom block so you have these minecarts

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
custom block so you have these minecarts
with<00:01:39.030> custom<00:01:39.420> blocks<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.770> can

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
with custom blocks in it and you can

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
with custom blocks in it and you can
even<00:01:41.100> give<00:01:41.340> them<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> custom<00:01:41.880> offset<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.990> when

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
even give them a custom offset but when

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
even give them a custom offset but when
you<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.530> too<00:01:43.680> far<00:01:43.950> away<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.579> minecart

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you look too far away from the minecart

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
you look too far away from the minecart
they<00:01:45.420> disappear<00:01:46.049> while<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:46.950> them<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
they disappear while you put them in a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.249 
they disappear while you put them in a
spawner<00:01:47.640> however<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.930> always<00:01:49.079> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
spawner however they will always be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.069 
spawner however they will always be
visible<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.950> they're<00:01:50.340> also<00:01:50.729> rotating<00:01:51.299> but

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
visible and they're also rotating but

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
visible and they're also rotating but
again<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
again I did not come up with this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
again I did not come up with this
check<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.450> hi<00:01:54.659> folks<00:01:54.899> I'm<00:01:55.110> Adam<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:55.670> here

check out hi folks I'm Adam over here
who<00:01:57.149> originally<00:01:57.719> invented<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.409> thing<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
who originally invented this thing to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
who originally invented this thing to
create<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.420> Foner's<00:02:00.869> use<00:02:01.320> this

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
create one of these Foner's use this

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
create one of these Foner's use this
command<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.939> change<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.869> make<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
command you can change this to make the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.530 
command you can change this to make the
block<00:02:04.590> appear<00:02:04.860> higher<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.460> lower<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
block appear higher or lower and you can

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
block appear higher or lower and you can
change<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.380> make<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> block<00:02:07.890> rotate

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
change this to make the block rotate

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
change this to make the block rotate
faster<00:02:08.849> or<00:02:09.000> slower<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.929> bigger<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.319> number

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
faster or slower the bigger the number

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.030 
faster or slower the bigger the number
the<00:02:10.649> slower<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> minecart<00:02:11.700> rotates<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the slower the minecart rotates and the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.949 
the slower the minecart rotates and the
of<00:02:13.219> course<00:02:13.459> are<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.909> coordinates<00:02:14.629> of<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
of course are the coordinates of the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
of course are the coordinates of the
spawner<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:16.040> let's<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.459> look<00:02:16.579> at<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
spawner now let's have a look at the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.030 
spawner now let's have a look at the
growing<00:02:17.030> tree<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:18.079> what<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.560> long<00:02:18.769> chain

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
growing tree that's what this long chain

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.429 
growing tree that's what this long chain
is<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.489> let<00:02:20.239> me<00:02:20.329> show<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.780> process<00:02:21.049> of

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
is for let me show you the process of

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.559 
is for let me show you the process of
making<00:02:21.650> an<00:02:21.890> animation<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:23.390> what<00:02:23.540> I

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
making an animation like this so what I

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.660 
making an animation like this so what I
basically<00:02:23.659> do<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.500> go<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.099> position<00:02:25.340> where

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
basically do I go to the position where

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.459 
basically do I go to the position where
I<00:02:25.879> want<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> place<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.390> block<00:02:26.629> so<00:02:27.109> let's<00:02:27.290> say<00:02:27.439> I

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
I want to place a block so let's say I

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.809 
I want to place a block so let's say I
want<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.829> place<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.069> wood<00:02:28.370> block<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.760> over

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
want to place a wood block right over

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.960 
want to place a wood block right over
here<00:02:29.540> then<00:02:30.230> I'll<00:02:30.379> use<00:02:30.530> slash<00:02:30.890> spawn<00:02:31.340> point<00:02:31.579> to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
here then I'll use slash spawn point to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000 
here then I'll use slash spawn point to
see<00:02:32.180> my<00:02:32.329> coordinates<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:33.500> I'll<00:02:33.620> create<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
see my coordinates then I'll create the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.809 
see my coordinates then I'll create the
setblock<00:02:34.280> command

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
setblock command

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.140 
setblock command
so<00:02:35.060> type<00:02:35.510> /setblock<00:02:36.470> those<00:02:37.400> coordinates<00:02:38.000> we

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
so type /setblock those coordinates we

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.319 
so type /setblock those coordinates we
just<00:02:38.390> saw<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.810> any<00:02:39.560> block<00:02:39.889> ID<00:02:40.099> I'll<00:02:40.549> use<00:02:41.000> one

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
just saw and any block ID I'll use one

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.990 
just saw and any block ID I'll use one
as<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.189> block<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.489> now<00:02:43.609> stone

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
as you can see the block is now stone

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.990 
as you can see the block is now stone
but<00:02:44.659> in<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.900> case<00:02:45.139> we<00:02:45.379> want<00:02:45.560> wood<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.549> let<00:02:46.909> me

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
but in this case we want wood so let me

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.240 
but in this case we want wood so let me
go<00:02:47.120> into<00:02:47.269> my<00:02:47.480> inventory<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.200> when<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> hover

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
go into my inventory and when I hover

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.589 
go into my inventory and when I hover
over<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.730> would<00:02:50.000> look<00:02:50.209> you'll<00:02:50.720> see<00:02:51.639> 17/3<00:02:52.639> if

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
over this would look you'll see 17/3 if

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.170 
over this would look you'll see 17/3 if
you<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.930> see<00:02:54.169> this<00:02:54.349> press<00:02:54.709> f3<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.459> h<00:02:55.669> when

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
you can see this press f3 and h when

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360 
you can see this press f3 and h when
you're<00:02:56.329> not<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.689> the<00:02:56.720> inventory<00:02:57.169> now<00:02:58.069> we'll<00:02:58.220> go

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you're not in the inventory now we'll go

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.339 
you're not in the inventory now we'll go
back<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.819> command<00:02:59.120> use<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.019> up<00:03:00.139> arrow

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
back to that command use the up arrow

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.869 
back to that command use the up arrow
key<00:03:00.439> to<00:03:00.799> get<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.220> command<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.609> just

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
key to get to the command we just

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.449 
key to get to the command we just
entered<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:03.049> we'll<00:03:03.200> change<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.769> 1<00:03:03.980> into

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
entered and now we'll change the 1 into

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.440 
entered and now we'll change the 1 into
17<00:03:05.090> space<00:03:05.659> 3<00:03:06.379> now<00:03:07.010> as<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.489> can<00:03:07.609> see<00:03:07.669> you<00:03:08.209> place

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
17 space 3 now as you can see you place

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.080 
17 space 3 now as you can see you place
the<00:03:08.629> wood<00:03:08.750> block<00:03:08.930> over<00:03:09.230> there<00:03:09.700> now<00:03:10.700> let's<00:03:10.879> copy

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
the wood block over there now let's copy

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.729 
the wood block over there now let's copy
this<00:03:11.329> command<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.900> put<00:03:12.109> it<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.439> command

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
this command and put it in a command

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.069 
this command and put it in a command
block<00:03:12.829> play<00:03:13.430> some<00:03:13.700> repeaters<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.389> start<00:03:14.930> with

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
block play some repeaters and start with

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.439 
block play some repeaters and start with
the<00:03:15.169> next<00:03:15.349> block<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.459> now<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.849> have<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> general

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
the next block so now you have a general

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.379 
the next block so now you have a general
idea<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.199> how<00:03:18.379> I<00:03:18.409> make<00:03:18.680> animations<00:03:19.310> using<00:03:19.970> set

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
idea of how I make animations using set

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.990 
idea of how I make animations using set
block<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.870> also<00:03:21.859> use<00:03:22.159> some<00:03:22.190> falling<00:03:22.760> sand

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
block I also use some falling sand

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.059 
block I also use some falling sand
blocks<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:23.780> let<00:03:24.139> me<00:03:24.229> show<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:24.440> real<00:03:24.769> quickly

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
blocks so let me show you real quickly

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.640 
blocks so let me show you real quickly
how<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.370> did<00:03:25.669> that<00:03:26.019> let's<00:03:27.019> say<00:03:27.169> I<00:03:27.199> want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.500> make

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
how I did that let's say I want to make

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.339 
how I did that let's say I want to make
this<00:03:27.859> block<00:03:28.129> fall<00:03:28.400> fly<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.449> the<00:03:29.569> Neath<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.989> use

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
this block fall fly in the Neath it use

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.439

falling<00:03:34.400> sent<00:03:34.669> those<00:03:35.419> coordinates<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.379> now

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
falling sent those coordinates and now

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.710 
falling sent those coordinates and now
you<00:03:37.190> see<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.000> following<00:03:38.269> block<00:03:38.510> is

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you see that the following block is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.229 
you see that the following block is
spawned<00:03:39.019> where<00:03:39.319> my<00:03:39.470> feet<00:03:39.799> were<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.729> we'll

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
spawned where my feet were so we'll

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.300 
spawned where my feet were so we'll
increase<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.690> y-coordinate<00:03:42.620> by<00:03:42.799> 2<00:03:42.859> blocks

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
increase the y-coordinate by 2 blocks

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.849 
increase the y-coordinate by 2 blocks
now<00:03:44.239> all<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.959> do<00:03:45.079> is<00:03:45.290> change<00:03:45.680> the

now all we have to do is change the

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.610 
now all we have to do is change the
block<00:03:46.010> ID<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.819> add<00:03:47.120> two<00:03:47.659> curly<00:03:48.019> brackets<00:03:48.229> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
block ID so add two curly brackets and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.509 
block ID so add two curly brackets and
put<00:03:49.370> down<00:03:49.790> ID<00:03:50.030> :<00:03:50.780> inside<00:03:51.409> it<00:03:51.590> let's<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.489> a

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
put down ID : inside it let's have a

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.800 
put down ID : inside it let's have a
look<00:03:52.760> at<00:03:52.879> my<00:03:53.000> inventory<00:03:53.500> quartz<00:03:54.500> s<00:03:54.650> ID<00:03:55.090> 155<00:03:56.090> so

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
look at my inventory quartz s ID 155 so

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.520 
look at my inventory quartz s ID 155 so
add<00:03:57.079> block<00:03:57.379> ID<00:03:58.090> 155<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.359> there<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.079> go<00:04:00.260> it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
add block ID 155 and there we go it
