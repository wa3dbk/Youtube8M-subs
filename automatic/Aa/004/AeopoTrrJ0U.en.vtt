sculptures that people make and I was
inspired<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.639> when<00:03:32.639> we<00:03:32.729> went<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
inspired to do this when we went to the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.599 
inspired to do this when we went to the
Art<00:03:33.299> Museum<00:03:33.979> it<00:03:34.979> was<00:03:35.129> one<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:37.609> projects

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
Art Museum it was one of the projects

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.750 
Art Museum it was one of the projects
that<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.970> kids<00:03:39.859> could<00:03:40.859> do<00:03:41.099> they<00:03:41.579> didn't

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that the kids could do they didn't

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.809 
that the kids could do they didn't
really<00:03:41.849> want<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> time<00:03:43.049> but<00:03:43.519> anyway<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
really want to at the time but anyway I

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.610 
really want to at the time but anyway I
was<00:03:45.000> inspired<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.079> think<00:03:46.290> these<00:03:46.409> are<00:03:46.470> kind

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
was inspired and I think these are kind

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640 
was inspired and I think these are kind
of<00:03:46.829> fun<00:03:47.099> um<00:03:48.109> that's<00:03:49.109> I'm<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.470> show<00:03:49.560> you

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
streamed and close that I'll probably

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.510 
streamed and close that I'll probably
glue<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.389> cartoon<00:04:26.120> after<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:28.520> don't

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.120 
glue this cartoon after that I don't
really<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:30.060> how<00:04:30.210> full<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.110> I'll<00:04:31.680> be

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
really like how full of it so I'll be

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.200 
really like how full of it so I'll be
putting<00:04:32.370> in<00:04:32.550> pieces<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.090> cardboard<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:34.139> maybe

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
putting in pieces of cardboard and maybe

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.790 
putting in pieces of cardboard and maybe
some<00:04:36.210> paper<00:04:36.389> tubes<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:37.350> just<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.680> make<00:04:37.770> it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
some paper tubes but just to make it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.950 
some paper tubes but just to make it
small<00:04:38.220> I'll<00:04:38.970> probably<00:04:39.240> paint<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.750> little

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
small I'll probably paint it a little

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.659 
small I'll probably paint it a little
bit<00:04:40.110> too<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.710> I'll<00:04:41.220> show<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:41.639> that
