00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.780 
this is the way to go imagine us going
through<00:03:40.659> a<00:03:40.720> scratch<00:03:41.109> on<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.500> car<00:03:41.769> yeah<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.280> pin

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
through a scratch on this car yeah I pin

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
through a scratch on this car yeah I pin
for<00:03:42.970> an<00:03:43.060> auto<00:03:43.239> show<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.019> consider<00:03:44.409> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
for an auto show so I consider the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.710 
for an auto show so I consider the
carpet<00:03:44.949> for<00:03:45.129> different<00:03:45.549> yeah<00:03:46.180> we<00:03:46.419> were<00:03:46.540> used

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
carpet for different yeah we were used

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.629 
carpet for different yeah we were used
to<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.989> thrash<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.859> know<00:03:47.979> is<00:03:48.159> always<00:03:48.459> like

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
to the thrash you know is always like

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.399 
to the thrash you know is always like
every<00:03:48.909> second<00:03:49.299> weekend<00:03:49.659> at<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.810> track<00:03:49.930> but

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
every second weekend at the track but

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.409 
every second weekend at the track but
getting<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.430> ready<00:03:51.549> for<00:03:51.669> a<00:03:51.849> display<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.269> an

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
getting it ready for a display in an

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.309 
getting it ready for a display in an
auto<00:03:52.569> show<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.989> was<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.109> whole<00:03:53.290> different

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
auto show that was a whole different

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.460 
auto show that was a whole different
thing<00:03:53.909> certainly<00:03:54.909> virtually<00:03:55.750> every<00:03:56.019> system

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
thing certainly virtually every system

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.929 
thing certainly virtually every system
on<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> car<00:03:56.919> needed<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.280> be<00:03:57.400> gone<00:03:57.549> through<00:03:57.819> no

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
on the car needed to be gone through no

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.390 
on the car needed to be gone through no
key<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.599> engine<00:03:58.720> was<00:03:58.989> fresh

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
key and the engine was fresh

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.649 
key and the engine was fresh
transmission<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.519> pressed<00:04:00.790> rear<00:04:01.060> ended<00:04:01.419> fish

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
transmission is pressed rear ended fish

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.229 
transmission is pressed rear ended fish
but<00:04:02.319> if<00:04:02.530> they<00:04:02.650> had<00:04:02.769> sat<00:04:03.069> return<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.939> they<00:04:04.090> had

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
but if they had sat return so they had

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.330 
but if they had sat return so they had
to<00:04:04.359> be<00:04:04.479> gone<00:04:04.659> through<00:04:04.930> well<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.919> think<00:04:06.189> our

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
to be gone through well I think our

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.409 
to be gone through well I think our
biggest<00:04:06.549> advantage<00:04:07.299> was<00:04:08.250> old<00:04:09.250> gym<00:04:09.639> and<00:04:09.879> the

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
biggest advantage was old gym and the

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.149 
biggest advantage was old gym and the
exhaust<00:04:10.780> system<00:04:11.169> we<00:04:11.259> fabricated<00:04:11.769> something

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
exhaust system we fabricated something

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.879 
exhaust system we fabricated something
that's<00:04:12.340> truly<00:04:12.939> yeah<00:04:13.419> yeah<00:04:14.379> that<00:04:14.560> would<00:04:14.709> that

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
that's truly yeah yeah that would that

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.830 
that's truly yeah yeah that would that
