this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> cheap<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> fix<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.979> took<00:01:47.100> one

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this is a cheap way to fix it I took one

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.170 
this is a cheap way to fix it I took one
zip<00:01:47.759> tie<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.470> around<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> little

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
zip tie and got it to go around a little

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.609 
zip tie and got it to go around a little
so<00:01:51.180> almost<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> same<00:01:51.689> width<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.229> zip<00:01:52.439> tie

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so almost the same width as the zip tie

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
so almost the same width as the zip tie
I<00:01:52.649> had<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.159> two<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> wrapped<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I had to use two of them and wrapped it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.889 
I had to use two of them and wrapped it
around<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:56.090> lippy<00:01:57.090> nickels<00:01:57.600> around

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
around the little lippy nickels around

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.679 
around the little lippy nickels around
there<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> after<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.799> got<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:00.479> goes

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
there and after I got that one that goes

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
there and after I got that one that goes
around<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.880> took<00:02:02.880> another<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:04.549> tightened

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
around I took another one and tightened

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.359 
around I took another one and tightened
it<00:02:05.670> around<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.360> pull<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.439> half<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.979> tight

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it around to pull the back half in tight

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
it around to pull the back half in tight
so<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.970> force<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> top<00:02:09.720> half<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.229> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
so it would force the top half up in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.500 
so it would force the top half up in
then<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> Walmart<00:02:12.060> or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
then what you do is you go to Walmart or

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
then what you do is you go to Walmart or
you<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.870> even

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you can even
