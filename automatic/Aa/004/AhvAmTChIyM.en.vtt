 at mcc is happy to introduce the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.880
 pvc window to 80 ideal in new as in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 renovation 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.100
 the range at 80 stands out for its openness 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.130
 foam and 80 mm to 6 bedrooms 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 insulation they are 70 mm 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.410
 in order to chamber the innovation of this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 window is located in the heart of the profile in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 white and in color the profile is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.500
 blunted by a tv component it's 100% 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.110
 recyclable 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 this insulating foam and co extruded it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.920
 helps boost performance 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.410
 thermal and improve the resistance 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 deformation and torsion of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.239
 profiles in addition to the message 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 profiles and colors feature 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 fiberglass rod placed at 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 strategic positions people 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 allow woodwork to 82 colors 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 to present identical performances 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.160
 to joineries to 80 white 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 people limit in many cases 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.159
 reinforcements steel and thus ensures a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.320
 optimal insulation thanks to welding 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.390
 in the angles of the profile and the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 foam the frame is twice as much 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 resistant than a pvc joinery 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.619
 standard the window of the range to 80 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 morning a performance wages 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.979
 exceptional thanks to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 double seal on the opening and the sleeper 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.220
 associated with a foam opener and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 indeformable and is the best 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 shield for airtightness 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.979
 100% compatible with the test 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.380
 of infiltrometry the double june allows 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.740
 to achieve a bitter performance at 4 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.500
 as part of the bbc approach 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 other novelty the range to 80 offers 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.780
 modern times unpublished for pvc 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 the carpentry has a layer 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.909
 tinted made with the technique of the pm 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.369
 m 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.009
 used in exterior cladding on 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.960
 pvc joinery the pmm 1 allows 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.350
 to obtain shades before 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.119
 reserved for aluminum joinery ce 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.859
 new material is very stable at the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.670
 light is insensitive to the 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.129
 discoloration 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.099
 it is very resistant to scratches and 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:16.390
 climatic conditions windy sun and 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.220
 rain the pmm is 100% recyclable and does not 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 requires no special maintenance at 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.239
 daily to adapt to all 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 market requirements 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.950
 even the most pointed the range to 80 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.799
 has scalable performance 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.510
 depending on the configuration it comes 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:40.299
 with a glazing from 28 to 44 mm a budget 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 from 1.1 to 0.60 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.859
 a nu w of 1.2 to 0.81 for a version 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.930
 passivhaus compatible in calculations 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.840
 thermal were validated by the ft of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.599
 rosenheim we offer the version at 80 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.220
 evolutionary thermal plus endow with a 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.420
 complementary heat shield 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.200
 thus guaranteeing a and w of 0.78 and a 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.139
 nu w of implementation of 0.80 in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.359
 standard the 80 consists of a opener 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.819
 by venting with metal rage 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.540
 and semi perry on the day laborer 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.069
 this system not visible from the outside 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.799
 allows to ventilate safely 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.510
 you can ventilate your window without 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.910
 risk thanks to the mushrooms guys 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.280
 blocked by lagache which thus avoids everything 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.470
 risk of fractions in position 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.270
 closing the gall and mushrooms being 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.330
 tea in the fork 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.270
 in French open position the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.700
 roller is free in open position in 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.190
 ventilating the roller is maintained by the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.410
 waste but made a displacement of 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.740
 a few mm to ensure a 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.060
 intermingling of the daily leaf 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.340
 louvre by ventilating is also 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.390
 waterproof in case of rain up to a wind 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.630
 outside of 30 km time there 80 is 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.150
 offered as standard with 28 mm glazing 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.510
 low emissivity filled with argon gas 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.000
 at 90% and a shoah edge dividers 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.580
 was stainless steel that allows you to perform 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.890
 heating savings for up to 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.680
 of comfort it is also possible to 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.850
 associate a sound insulation of 28 to 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.739
 40 db series window to 80 is 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.720
 equipped with a handle that ensures a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.510
 resistance to external aggressions 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.850
 for even more security when 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.400
 you handle the handle you hear 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.740
 if the window is closed to 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.750
 guarantee maximum security 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.340
 this range is equipped with strike and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.320
 pebbles mushrooms that allow 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.690
 to avoid the recess of the window 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.880
 in closed position the pvc range at 80 da 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.250
 mccc technical innovations of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.350
 outstanding thermal performance a
