00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 bmw presents the third generation 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.880
 the x5 for 14 years bmw has the as you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 go or better sport activity 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 vehicle in the program and thus the big one 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.109
 Trend of sporty roads 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 SUV decisively influenced 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 is standard in almost all models 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 the all-wheel drive xdrive installed 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 this is the first time in this generation 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 also a hedge driven diesel 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.349
 version on the market the head up 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 Display that can display all colors 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.260
 informs the driver with a new display 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260
 content 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 the new x5 is a complete one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 redevelopment that you can see on the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.410
 Design on the front of the front 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 the grille is much steeper now 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 and here in the interior the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.059
 instruments are still here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.390
 Driver-oriented, that's what I think 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.790
 really great three engines offers 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.090
 bmw at the start of the sale we test the 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.650
 x5 xdrive 30d be six cylinder 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.410
 diesel engine with three liters of displacement 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.790
 generates 190 kilowatts of power and 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.800
 has a maximum torque 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.800
 from 560 newton meters 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.790
 so the sprint succeeds from the stand 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 to 100 km h in 6.9 seconds 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.850
 the newly developed engines provide 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.300
 beyond that for better 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.300
 consumption values 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 we have with all models 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.049
 Significant improvements in 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.789
 consumers can achieve up to 17 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.960
 percent 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.259
 for example, in our volume model 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.399
 the same applies to the x5 30d 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.829
 other engines in similar 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.429
 order of magnitude and the highlight is 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.670
 certainly our 325 it de of no fewer 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.490
 and write 149 grams of co2 comes along 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.060
 that is 5 6 liters per 100 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.459
 kilometer was visually refreshed the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.780
 double headlights extend to the 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.780
 bmw typical kidneys 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.450
 striking lines and beads cover 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.590
 the whole car with an exciting 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.930
 light and shadow play 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.090
 This makes it more compact than one 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.330
 total length of 4 meters 90 suspect 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.330
 leaves 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.560
 The interior surrounds the passengers 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.750
 a pleasant design doors and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.430
 dashboard by horizontal lines 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.680
 connects with each other 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
 bmw has the selection of assistance systems 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.060
 for example through night vision with 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.739
 Person recognition as well as a new park 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.680
 assistants with longitudinal and transverse guidance 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.660
 extends the one drive knob in the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 Center console has a sensor box that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.370
 read the handwriting of the driver 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.490
 practically the luggage compartment unlocking 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.380
 worth pressure on the ignition key 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.390
 as standard, the middle divided 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.970
 hatchback has been the x5 since the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.290
 first generation split in three 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.750
 now lean the back seat 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.260
 fold on the storage space of care 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.240
 maximum 1870 liters that is 100 more 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.950
 as the predecessor on request is also 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.950
 a third row of seats possible 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.980
 Actually, the x5 is all sports 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.050
 activity vehicle yes mainly for 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.819
 The street is constructed because of that 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.600
 now also a variant only with 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.010
 rear drive 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.420
 Of course we are fine 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.400
 we think we are very successful 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.010
 want to continue to be so in all 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.680
 world regions and there are regions 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 where the extra from weather conditions 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.370
 does not play the big role or 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 For example, offered in countries 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.330
 this is supposed to be a where there is a co2 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.069
 taxation exists in the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.870
 four - wheel drive version of the master 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.950
 was also reasonably in the field 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.380
 difficult passages pretty easy 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.390
 and here comes the proof we want it 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.160
 know exactly and do with the x5 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.230
 a trip off the beaten track 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.579
 the sovereign masters the well two 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.950
 tons of heavy dare drive over 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.300
 unpaved slopes on uneven 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.820
 underground is the four-wheel drive 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.500
 number of the force distributed to the wheels 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.500
 who have a good contact with the ground 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.230
 even smaller trenches do not provide 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.230
 obstacle 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.899
 June 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.990
 whether with four-wheel drive or with rear wheel drive 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.950
 the new bmw x5 will surely be his 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.780
 find trailer 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 because although he is actually from the outside 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.440
 it looks pretty big from the driver's seat 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.810
 very handy and clear next 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.300
 the standard eight-speed automatic has 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.930
 the x5 always also auto start stop 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.060
 function 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.410
 this reduces the consumption with the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.030
 also standard 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.890
 driving experience can 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.830
 different driving modes set 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.170
 13 million times has become the x5 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.360
 So far, we have been selling new ones 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.230
 best chances to the successes of his 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.230
 to connect with predecessors
