want<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> basically<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
want to do is basically I think one of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.180 
want to do is basically I think one of
the<00:00:36.809> best<00:00:37.079> ways<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.129> actually

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the best ways to do it is to actually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
the best ways to do it is to actually
put<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.579> armor<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> physically

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
put your armor on so you can physically

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
put your armor on so you can physically
see<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.370> want<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> select<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.000> die

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
see it then you want to select the die

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
see it then you want to select the die
which<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:43.950> hover<00:00:44.219> over

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
which you want and actually hover over

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
which you want and actually hover over
it<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.149> body<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.960> say<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to

select that and I'm actually going to go

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
select that and I'm actually going to go

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you're not obligated to do just one

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
you're not obligated to do just one
color<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.710> multiple<00:00:55.920> colors<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
color you can do multiple colors on that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
color you can do multiple colors on that
armor<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> they'll<00:00:58.199> give<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.620> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
different twist of certain type of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.090 
different twist of certain type of
colors<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.020> think<00:01:01.230> that'll<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.559> great
