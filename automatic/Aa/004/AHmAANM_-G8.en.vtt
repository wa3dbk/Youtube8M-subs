00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 like this and with a super cute tutorial 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 and super easy to make is a skirt 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.540
 circular or better known as valdés that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.619
 see lots of girls 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 these habits that we are in spring 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.199
 she is approaching summer although I think that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.150
 be cold this would not be very pretty and if 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 it's a super easy tutorial it does not say 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.510
 fight to cause what I do not have my 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 machine in those moments so it's my turn 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 do it by hand see us no espartaco 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.290
 but believe me I'm not an expert for 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.860
 earn some doing and what I could do your 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.680
 fast and super normally so if I 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.010
 You can do as I did and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.629
 uncertain statizations we are going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.460
 I need fabric and I complete the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 viscoelastic of a meter I bought it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 elastic so as not to put a vote or 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 zipper and make it easier we're going to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.650
 need a meter and those of the color of the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 fabric scissors pins and needles 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.910
 We will start by folding the fabric 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 half and then one more time in half 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 make sure you are on the side 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.290
 otherwise we will measure the outline of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.210
 our waist and the length we want 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.979
 let it be our skirt 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.200
 then we will divide the measure that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.090
 we got from the waist by six the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.190
 we will divide into 36 and the result will 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.500
 we will begin to mark in the corner of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.090
 the fabric we will put the meter in the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.979
 little corner and we'll start rotating it like that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.080
 like a compass and begin to 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.710
 create with the result of this division 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 a semicircle 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.120
 for the arch it is almost the same 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.110
 procedure only that the meter starts 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.780
 from the circle that we made 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.370
 before and to the extent to the extent 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.930
 that I got the arc, I subtracted 5 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.970
 centimeters that are 5 centimeters 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
 that we're going to create waistband so 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.420
 to create this mark subtract the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.870
 centimeters you want it to be you 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.870
 waistband 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.420
 then we will use these marks as 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.100
 reference to cut the fabric and once 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.320
 cut is how we are getting 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.630
 the skirt now we will go to do 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.700
 Waistband we will take a rest cloth you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 we will talk in half and as we already 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 I said I want my waistband of 5 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 centimeters so wide to do 10 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.840
 centimeters since we will double it by the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 half and long is half of the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.770
 contour of your waist plus 2 centimeters 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.540
 2 centimeters because then we will take 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.060
 these 2 centimeters are going to lose 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.860
 in the long when we have cut the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.690
 We will talk to you in the waistband in the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.250
 opposite side and we will take nothing more than 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.590
 the corners and that's why 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.090
 we needed 2 extra inches and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.650
 let's start sewing then you're going to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.900
 put the needle in a corner 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.820
 you take a little forward later 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 you return it by the previous hole 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.010
 Then you take the needle one more time 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.650
 a little bit later you return it by the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.330
 previous huequito and so easy is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.130
 super repetitive this sounds super weird 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.660
 but believe me it's super easy and a 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.340
 What I did is to use double 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.470
 thread so that the cooked was left 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.800
 super strong and my skirt will be super 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.800
 safe 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.560
 and that is how we have our waistband 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.990
 stitched dial right then let's 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.060
 place this waistband on the skirt 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.010
 over the top edge of the skirt all 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.390
 it has to be to the right and make sure 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.480
 that the two open parts of the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.120
 Waistband are next to the edge of the skirt 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.620
 let's sew this waistband with the layer 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.690
 of the skirt or be around make sure 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.550
 let it be only the first layer and so 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.310
 when we raise it, that's how it's going 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.710
 to get the waistband then now we go 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.330
 to start sewing and if you get me 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.530
 exactly in the same way as I sewed 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.530
 the waistband previously 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.310
 and that's how we get the waistband 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.830
 is not finished yet you have to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510
 keep knowing a little bit more but 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.970
 If this is how we are already getting the skirt with 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.530
 the waistband on when you've sewn 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.600
 all around the skirt the only thing that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.150
 What remains is to unite the two courts of 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.100
 Waistband for that I started sewing 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.560
 on the opposite side skirt 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.540
 side by side to ensure it well and as 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.520
 this is an elastic fabric I do not need 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.140
 put no vote or super zipper 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.610
 easy to put so I recommend them 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.610
 better if they buy an elastic fabric 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.060
 very much but before the several 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.070
 I want to make two announcements the first is 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.750
 offer to those people who have 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.210

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.760
 second is those social networks because 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.760

 gods and the names of my networks 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.720

 block with this french and it's going to be 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.520
 something hard to remember so you want 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.220

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.700
