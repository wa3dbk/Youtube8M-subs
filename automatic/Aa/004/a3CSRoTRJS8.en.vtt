00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
with with encaustic it makes them

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.719 
with with encaustic it makes them
transparent<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:44.399> sometimes<00:00:45.399> that's<00:00:45.550> exactly

you get these surprises that are oh my
goodness<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.109> is<00:00:53.289> not<00:00:53.469> at<00:00:53.620> all<00:00:53.710> what<00:00:53.949> I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
goodness this is not at all what I

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.879 
goodness this is not at all what I
wanted<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:54.549> for<00:00:55.420> example<00:00:55.929> on<00:00:56.170> this<00:00:56.620> little

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
wanted so for example on this little

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.840 
wanted so for example on this little
piece<00:00:57.129> what<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.789> was<00:00:57.999> doing<00:00:58.269> is<00:00:58.389> using<00:00:58.809> some<00:00:59.199> old

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
piece what I was doing is using some old

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.399 
piece what I was doing is using some old
Italian<00:01:00.850> paper<00:01:01.030> some<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.539> were<00:01:01.659> handwritten

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
Italian paper some that were handwritten

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.940 
Italian paper some that were handwritten
and<00:01:02.920> others<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.940> were<00:01:04.089> actually<00:01:04.860> printed<00:01:05.860> in

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
and others that were actually printed in

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.029 
and others that were actually printed in
a<00:01:06.039> book<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.570> what<00:01:07.869> happens<00:01:08.289> when<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.530> wax<00:01:08.680> hits

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
a book so what happens when the wax hits

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.149 
a book so what happens when the wax hits
that<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.640> course<00:01:10.539> it<00:01:10.840> makes<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:11.979> paper

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
that of course it makes the paper

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.789 
that of course it makes the paper
transparent<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:13.270> translucent<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.289> so<00:01:14.710> you

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
transparent or translucent and so you

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.880 
transparent or translucent and so you
actually<00:01:15.070> see<00:01:15.460> both<00:01:15.850> sides<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.689> paper

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually see both sides of the paper

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.109 
actually see both sides of the paper
coming<00:01:17.890> through<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:18.310> your<00:01:18.340> image<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:18.909> get

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
coming through in your image so you get

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.200 
coming through in your image so you get
both<00:01:19.390> both<00:01:20.289> sides<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.009> printed<00:01:21.430> text<00:01:21.909> so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
both both sides of the printed text so

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.209 
both both sides of the printed text so
you<00:01:22.299> can<00:01:22.359> kind<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.350> there<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.829> on

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
you can kind of see it there on the on

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.399 
you can kind of see it there on the on
the<00:01:24.340> right<00:01:24.490> hand<00:01:24.759> side<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.329> image<00:01:25.509> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
the right hand side of the image the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.200 
the right hand side of the image the
other<00:01:26.590> thing<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.039> can<00:01:27.189> even<00:01:27.340> see<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.759> printed

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
other thing we can even see the printed

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.779 
other thing we can even see the printed
text<00:01:28.689> from<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.530> book<00:01:29.679> page<00:01:29.950> coming<00:01:30.579> through

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
text from the book page coming through

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.649 
text from the book page coming through
that<00:01:30.820> handwritten<00:01:31.479> letter<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.250> as<00:01:33.700> mentioned

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
that handwritten letter so as mentioned

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.209 
that handwritten letter so as mentioned
it's<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.229> good<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.409> be<00:01:35.560> aware<00:01:35.859> of<00:01:35.920> that

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
it's just good to be aware of that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.120 
it's just good to be aware of that
because<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:38.109> other<00:01:38.289> thing<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.619> can<00:01:38.859> happen

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
because the other thing that can happen

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.060 
because the other thing that can happen
is<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.460> can<00:01:39.820> sometimes<00:01:40.090> have<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:41.070> transparent

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
is you can sometimes have a transparent

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.940 
is you can sometimes have a transparent
paper<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.609> top<00:01:42.969> of<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.570> wood<00:01:43.929> panel<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.740> maybe

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
paper on top of a wood panel that maybe

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.179 
paper on top of a wood panel that maybe
you<00:01:45.249> haven't<00:01:45.549> primed<00:01:46.030> with<00:01:46.240> something<00:01:46.719> white

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you haven't primed with something white

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
you haven't primed with something white
like<00:01:48.719> you<00:01:49.719> know<00:01:49.869> your<00:01:50.170> tempera<00:01:51.130> paint<00:01:51.399> or<00:01:51.759> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like you know your tempera paint or a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.950 
like you know your tempera paint or a
layer<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.219> cardstock<00:01:54.670> something<00:01:55.600> like<00:01:55.749> that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
layer of cardstock something like that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.380 
layer of cardstock something like that
and<00:01:56.229> what<00:01:56.920> can<00:01:57.100> happen<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.700> once<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.060> paper

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and what can happen is once that paper

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.410 
and what can happen is once that paper
becomes<00:01:58.869> transparent<00:01:59.969> you'll<00:02:00.969> see<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.270> wood

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
becomes transparent you'll see the wood

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.389 
becomes transparent you'll see the wood
grain<00:02:01.450> through<00:02:01.960> or<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.530> color<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.189> base
