so<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> basic<00:01:19.590> premises<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.790> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so the basic premises is if you can do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
so the basic premises is if you can do
the<00:01:21.090> vault<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> glass<00:01:21.420> i<00:01:21.750> recommend<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> doing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the vault of glass i recommend you doing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
the vault of glass i recommend you doing
it<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.820> least<00:01:23.970> level<00:01:24.210> 26<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it if you're at least level 26 then you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
it if you're at least level 26 then you
can<00:01:25.259> start<00:01:25.409> doing<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> normal<00:01:26.009> mode<00:01:26.340> if

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
can start doing the normal mode if

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
can start doing the normal mode if
you're<00:01:26.820> least<00:01:27.060> level<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.509> 29<00:01:27.840> 30<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you're least level like 29 30 you have a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.749 
you're least level like 29 30 you have a
bunch<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> people<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.130> carry<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> through<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bunch of people to carry you through it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
bunch of people to carry you through it
go<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.390> level<00:01:30.570> 30<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
go for the level 30 because you get a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
go for the level 30 because you get a
ridiculous<00:01:32.070> amount<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> Senate<00:01:32.820> choice<00:01:32.970> i

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
ridiculous amount of a Senate choice i

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.640 
ridiculous amount of a Senate choice i
know<00:01:33.180> i<00:01:33.299> did<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.930> recently<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> live

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
know i did it just recently on a live

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.340 
know i did it just recently on a live
stream<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.579> 21<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> sentence<00:01:36.869> shards<00:01:37.259> i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
stream I had like 21 a sentence shards i

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
stream I had like 21 a sentence shards i
did<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.619> mostly<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.100> shards<00:01:38.490> than<00:01:38.670> energy

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
did get mostly more shards than energy

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
did get mostly more shards than energy
and<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> course<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.200> dismantled<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> armor

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and of course i dismantled my the armor

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
and of course i dismantled my the armor
that<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.579> along<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that I got along with it but you get a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.969 
that I got along with it but you get a
lot<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.229> shots<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> vault<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> glass

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
lot of shots from the vault of glass

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
lot of shots from the vault of glass
right<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> main<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
right and this is the main way you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.389 
right and this is the main way you
should<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:46.110> trying<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> get<00:01:46.649> into<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
should be trying to get into this so the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
should be trying to get into this so the
previous<00:01:47.670> video<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.119> basically<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.930> up

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
previous video can basically put you up

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
previous video can basically put you up
to<00:01:49.079> level<00:01:49.320> 28<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.490> 229<00:01:50.939> area<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.659> kind

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to level 28 in 229 area with that kind

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
to level 28 in 229 area with that kind
of<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:51.960> before<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> need<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> lot<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.920> shards

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of thing before you need a lot of shards

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
of thing before you need a lot of shards
and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.610> you're<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.820> start<00:01:54.149> doing<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> lot

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and then you're gonna start doing a lot

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then you're gonna start doing a lot
of<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.590> shards<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of this for shards so you can do the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.490 
of this for shards so you can do the
regular<00:01:57.240> mode<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.869> popping<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> bunch<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
regular mode just popping a bunch of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
regular mode just popping a bunch of
friends<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> bunch<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> level<00:01:59.790> 32

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
friends if they have a bunch of level 32

can enter the level 30 raid please do it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
can enter the level 30 raid please do it
that<00:02:04.259> will<00:02:04.380> make<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.860> much<00:02:05.009> faster<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that will make it so much faster and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.249 
that will make it so much faster and
you'll<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.659> set<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> cards<00:02:07.110> each

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you'll get a lot of a set of cards each

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.809 
you'll get a lot of a set of cards each
vault<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.560> glass<00:02:07.590> red<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.129> could<00:02:08.280> easily<00:02:08.670> get

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
vault of glass red you could easily get

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
vault of glass red you could easily get
around<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.119> 20<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> 30<00:02:09.840> ascendant<00:02:10.619> shards

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
around like 20 to 30 ascendant shards

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
around like 20 to 30 ascendant shards
however<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:11.970> not

gasps waves there are other ways to get

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.220 
gasps waves there are other ways to get
ascendant<00:02:17.730> shards<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.480> first<00:02:18.780> being<00:02:19.080> the

ascendant shards the first being the
daily<00:02:19.620> mission<00:02:20.190> now<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.550> daily<00:02:20.940> mission<00:02:21.300> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
daily mission now this daily mission is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.090 
daily mission now this daily mission is
actually<00:02:21.810> changed<00:02:22.170> based<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.650> level<00:02:22.890> if

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
actually changed based on your level if

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually changed based on your level if
you<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> level<00:02:24.030> 30<00:02:24.270> difficulty<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you do the level 30 difficulty if you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.390 
you do the level 30 difficulty if you
have<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> friend<00:02:25.710> dragged<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.130> through<00:02:26.160> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
have a friend dragged you through it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.980 
have a friend dragged you through it
which<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.820> actually<00:02:26.940> not<00:02:27.330> really<00:02:27.390> hard<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
which is actually not really hard the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.660 
which is actually not really hard the
level<00:02:28.260> 30<00:02:28.470> daily<00:02:28.890> missions<00:02:29.190> are<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.460> very

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
level 30 daily missions are not very

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.580 
level 30 daily missions are not very
very<00:02:29.940> difficult<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.900> probably<00:02:31.110> could<00:02:31.350> still

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
very difficult you probably could still

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
very difficult you probably could still
do<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.740> level<00:02:32.010> 28<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> level<00:02:32.700> 30<00:02:32.970> mission<00:02:33.270> if

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
do a level 28 on a level 30 mission if

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.610 
do a level 28 on a level 30 mission if
you<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.600> know<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> mission<00:02:34.230> pretty<00:02:34.440> well

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you just know the mission pretty well

to actually get a Senate shards I think

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.280 
to actually get a Senate shards I think
it's<00:03:36.090> because<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.390> lot<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.630> people<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.870> using

it's because a lot of people just using

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.600 
it's because a lot of people just using
their<00:03:37.380> mouths<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:37.680> buying<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.489> just

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
their mouths like buying it and just

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.670 
their mouths like buying it and just
getting<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.030> which<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.360> kind<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.690> weird<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
getting it which is kind of weird but a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.320 
getting it which is kind of weird but a
really<00:03:40.860> ingenious<00:03:41.220> strategy<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:41.820> ya<00:03:42.030> know

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
really ingenious strategy but ya know

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.210 
really ingenious strategy but ya know
that<00:03:42.630> does<00:03:42.959> not<00:03:43.230> work<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.620> get<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> second

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that does not work to get you a second

what<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> recommend<00:03:46.950> doing<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.519> finding<00:03:47.790> at

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
what I recommend doing is finding at

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.699 
what I recommend doing is finding at
least<00:03:48.269> two<00:03:48.600> friends<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.500> higher

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
least two friends that have the higher
