00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
showing on screen right now and then

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.090 
showing on screen right now and then
next<00:00:43.420> thing<00:00:43.540> you<00:00:43.630> want<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.870> do<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.110> proceed<00:00:44.620> to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
next thing you want to do is proceed to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.150 
next thing you want to do is proceed to
this<00:00:45.400> point<00:00:45.850> on<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.210> map<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.710> reason<00:00:47.980> why

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
this point on the map and the reason why

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.369 
this point on the map and the reason why
is<00:00:48.220> because<00:00:48.540> this<00:00:49.540> is<00:00:49.780> one<00:00:50.080> of<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.230> more

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
is because this is one of the more

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.830 
is because this is one of the more
popular<00:00:51.220> spots<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.300> guess<00:00:52.559> where<00:00:53.559> people<00:00:54.840> have

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
popular spots I guess where people have

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.870 
popular spots I guess where people have
money<00:00:56.829> in<00:00:57.040> their<00:00:57.100> bank<00:00:57.250> accounts<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.760> stuff

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
money in their bank accounts and stuff

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.670 
money in their bank accounts and stuff
so<00:00:58.420> if<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.710> find<00:01:00.280> out<00:01:00.520> that<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:00.970> can't<00:01:01.680> hack

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
so if you find out that you can't hack

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.590 
so if you find out that you can't hack
anybody's<00:01:03.220> bank<00:01:03.430> balance<00:01:03.790> probably<00:01:04.210> because

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
anybody's bank balance probably because

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320 
anybody's bank balance probably because
