00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Good day to all good people 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.590
 keep doing my hairy 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 wooden box it came to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.969
 top cover means I typed two 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.199
 shirts 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.900
 Here are the other oak from the other paduk 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.619
 cut then yes to whom the size 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.109
 plywood is 4 millimeters plywood 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.010
 such a picture I think will be on 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.410
 cap 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.649
 pretty simple just starting mean 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.120
 I will use double sided tape for 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.059
 stapling bags glued on plywood 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 paduk top beech already help 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 glue stick and glue fix here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.410
 this one is a leaf with a picture of a mole tape 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 The whole thing is optin in general, then the package 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.180
 I'm ready to cut now by marking on 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.100
 jig saw 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.150
 Jigsaw I have jets ski but I already 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 quite a long time ago 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 the old model in my opinion is now new 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.259
 appeared nothing with him especially did 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.259
 because the tool 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.590
 I use it not so often the only thing 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.870
 what I bought 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.780
 a compressor from the aquarium and hooked it up 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.020
 instead of the regular pump because blew 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.020
 Of course, no staff 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.870
 here is a bunch of diaper pieces 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.430
 now this whole story will be needed 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 neatly disassemble like paris in 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.360
 The era of Louis 13 was not Ruslan Batista 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.450
 handkerchiefs so our books 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.600
 shops in general books about marquetry 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.940
 and the days are very rich and there are many 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.489
 books there 1 2 chapters 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.959
 about this story but this is clearly 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.530
 I did n't find enough 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.739
 the book is a translation from Spanish 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.350
 publishing house 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.140
 art-spring there in this book, it is very 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.350
 thin 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.310
 In general, this is its big drawback, but 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:02.870
 quite a few pictures and all the details 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:07.010
 painted though many methods don't seem 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.910
 a bit already archaic particular there 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.790
 veneer packages are nailed 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.660
 thin and choking i used 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.450
 double-sided tape if you find out 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.970
 books in Russian and in English 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.890
 good blots 3 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.420
 Please specify in the comments 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:36.350
 I will be grateful I will disassemble using 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:40.100
 different knives palette knife scotch separated 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.930
 I used it quite easily 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:49.540
 Here tape and polypropylene base 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.540
 thin here it looks like this 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.930
 I cling the edge with a knife, but then with a palette knife 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.960
 quietly moving very uncomfortable 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.740
 it's all done on camera in general then i 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.260
 I think the process is clear well, slowly 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.770
 Little by little it turns out such a set 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.530
 more precisely two sets of alternating mean different 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.660
 veneer strips fit together 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.780
 very good 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.020
 scotch moves away from gu worlds quite 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.820
 decently the only thing is that the spatula 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.410
 Of course you need to periodically wipe 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.690
 solvents scraping the residue here 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:47.330
 of this glue that's on tape here 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.870
 such a set is almost not 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.860
 nakosyachil here where nakosyachil this 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.440
 corrected now I will recruit already 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.950
 I put together these stripes between 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.950
 by myself 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.910
 finished typing and two shirts now 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:12.150
 glue them to the plywood on both sides 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:17.290
 I put in the press I glued to glue 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:20.380
 geberit such here means everything between 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:26.320
 two scraps chipboard 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:29.490
 there is more linoleum laid and newspapers will 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.190
 wait until the whole story is dry 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:37.630
 dismantled the forest improvised tres 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.950
 Itâ€™s probably almost a day now 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.740
 protruding edges 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.740
 what to cut off in the jamb 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.640
 I would shoot the bulk of the world 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.050
 pre- moisten with water like this 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.550
 here 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:06.970
 scraper but finally go belly 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.970
 cycle 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:28.040
 it turns out like this then the side is 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.170
 the second side finish is not yet 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.340
 final already before assembly will be 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:38.510
 again I will go around the chains that I forgot to say 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:41.000
 that before I type my shirt 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.850
 from the back but that side on 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.460
 which was applied to the clique on the veneer wiped 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.660
 white spirit and because there 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:53.930
 scotch marks left 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.770
 I will veneer plywood that will go 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.310
 at the bottom of the box 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:04.420
 probably on it for today all thanks 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.420
 for watching bye
