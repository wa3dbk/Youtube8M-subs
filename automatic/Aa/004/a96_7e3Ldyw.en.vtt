 the one played in marseille vivaux 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.960
 recently the 2 take this race count 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 of 1 the goal for him the real shot 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 sure to play the leading roles and why 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 not who was a two favorite number 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.800
 one is thirteenth day that was far 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 to be at the building of his fault the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 last time and very recently in the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.590
 final turning he comes back to the region 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 Parisian with ambitions all the same 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.120
 that he proved his speed 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.630
 12 overall Mitna but is also 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.980
 credit do not need him 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.270
 he hold rigor of his last race 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.440
 yelled and forced to progress in 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.920
 fourth thickness before going down 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.660
 flag 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 she finds here the opportunity to put 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.870
 the clocks at the hour then for the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.800
 places each number 4 say in fine to 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.130
 I do not think we have any more 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.510
 maneuver 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.460
 but a place is in her strings she 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.780
 is regular the number nine small jobs 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.310
 hard horse to the effort that comes from 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.790
 manifest a slight revival of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 condition 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.230
 you have to be wary of it as much as he had 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.690

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.190
 2013 and the number 5 wars and gauthier 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 even if most confirmed on the saddle 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.250
 he remains capable of lashing out at 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.650
 hitched mistrust is needed 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.240
