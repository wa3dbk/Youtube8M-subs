the pond this is the ponds here we're
car<00:01:04.470> keys<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> you've<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.689> medulla

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
car keys so you've got your medulla

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.520 
car keys so you've got your medulla
oblongata<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.880> pawns<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.869> cuz<00:01:10.350> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
oblongata then your pawns look cuz like

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
oblongata then your pawns look cuz like
further<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> book<00:01:11.310> intensity<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.360> your

further in the book intensity I got your

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
further in the book intensity I got your
found<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:13.470> hypothalamus<00:01:13.979> he's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
found this in your hypothalamus he's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.700 
found this in your hypothalamus he's
turning<00:01:15.090> oh<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.720> how's<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.350> optic<00:01:16.740> nerve

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
turning oh really how's your optic nerve

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
turning oh really how's your optic nerve
optic<00:01:19.710> nerve<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
optic nerve there on that what it is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
optic nerve there on that what it is
called<00:01:22.670> these<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.950> kairi<00:01:25.950> kairi<00:01:26.780> kairi

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
are the little folds if you touch the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.980 
are the little folds if you touch the
brain<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.540> feel<00:01:31.310> them<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> jury

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
brain you can feel them I think the jury

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.700 
brain you can feel them I think the jury
are<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> apex<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.700> full<00:01:38.180> gonna<00:01:39.180> man<00:01:39.710> your

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
different lobes of the brain can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.919 
different lobes of the brain can
actually<00:01:54.810> identify<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.399> brain

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually identify them on the brain

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.550 
actually identify them on the brain
that's<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.289> longitudinal<00:01:59.159> fissure<00:02:00.119> here

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340 

friends<00:02:04.560> alone<00:02:05.090> yes<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.509> does<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:07.020> friend

friends alone yes how does my friend

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.369 
friends alone yes how does my friend
Tyrell<00:02:07.709> your<00:02:07.920> parietal<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:09.450> occipital<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
Tyrell your parietal your occipital and

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.680 
Tyrell your parietal your occipital and
temporal<00:02:10.769> oh<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:13.920> comes<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.879> here<00:02:15.209> would<00:02:15.660> be

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
temporal oh here comes up here would be

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.069 
temporal oh here comes up here would be
the<00:02:16.819> olfactory<00:02:17.819> some<00:02:18.720> tracks<00:02:21.079> olfactory

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
the olfactory some tracks olfactory

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.680 
the olfactory some tracks olfactory
bulbs<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.799> tracks<00:02:23.099> are<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.489> here<00:02:23.880> then<00:02:24.299> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
bulbs and tracks are in here then you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.190 
bulbs and tracks are in here then you
have<00:02:24.720> your<00:02:25.010> their<00:02:26.010> optic<00:02:26.670> nerve<00:02:26.940> yeah<00:02:27.840> see

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
have your their optic nerve yeah see

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
have your their optic nerve yeah see
it's<00:02:28.319> down<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> optic<00:02:29.549> tract<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.329> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
it's down in the optic tract and the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.360 
it's down in the optic tract and the
optic<00:02:31.110> ok<00:02:31.760> kazma<00:02:32.760> which<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.900> ok<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.470> how

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
optic ok kazma which is here ok so how

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.410 
optic ok kazma which is here ok so how
are<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.670> man<00:02:38.940> Mary<00:02:39.239> body<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:41.420> can't

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
are you the man Mary body is can't

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
are you the man Mary body is can't
really<00:02:42.629> see<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.829> it's<00:02:43.890> under<00:02:44.459> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
really see it here but it's under it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.960 
really see it here but it's under it
would<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.910> underneath<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.629> pineal<00:02:46.170> gland

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
would be underneath the pineal gland

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.500 
would be underneath the pineal gland
under<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.660> white<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.349> color
