00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.000
 and now everything is ready in 1 video and 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.880
 well now let's see something new that 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.849
 he's also from the 1.4 he got a new 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 use to the network comparator with apart from 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.980
 all those with hopper with currents of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.320
 red ton and others now has a new use 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 as I had this use very well this is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.899
 they will ask that this maybe not me that 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.230
 be good if there is an item in it 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.760
 add a current one but if we turn 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.410
 this item 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.540
 every time we choose more go 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.370
 adding more current among others 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.470
 things can already be rotated diagonally 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.890
 before it could only be rotated four times 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.770
 well so and as normal of course in 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.329
 diagonal as if it were what a 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.359
 kind of 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.800
 I do not know how good it has several twists and 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.140
 those turns are activating the reaction 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.220
 As you can see , it occurred to me 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.869
 as to give more examples of a use that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.420
 would this be this this is kind of 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.799
 vault system for them to work 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.289
 everyone has to be in a position 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.289
 exact when it has to be 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 there or higher is a problem that 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.280
 may be higher this has to 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.909
 being there is perfect and this has to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.310
 be there and how can you see the door 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.319
 there it was opened if this one moved it more than the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.909
 account but today in this very 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.799
 perfected will close the door or 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 there is the new thing more than the account and this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.880
 it's okay if the door does not open 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.299
 you need all three to be well for 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 open up and well that's the new use 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.179
 it is very useful 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.060
 louis in a video part because that same 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.560
 interesting and well basically good of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 this would be all for this video we 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.929
 we will see in a next video until the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.929
 next goodbye 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990
 yes 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.540
 the antlers 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
