temperature is going up or going down at
the<00:02:34.760> moment<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> see<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> temperature<00:02:36.019> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the moment you see the temperature is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.040 
the moment you see the temperature is
slightly<00:02:36.410> rising<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:38.300> temperature<00:02:38.330> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
slightly rising the temperature is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.020 
slightly rising the temperature is
measured<00:02:39.380> every<00:02:40.069> two<00:02:40.280> minutes<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.790> right

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
measured every two minutes on the right

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.910

side<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.599> temperature<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
side of the temperature you have the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.300 
side of the temperature you have the
moon<00:02:46.130> face<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.989> can<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.560> all<00:02:48.799> covered

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
moon face you can see it's all covered

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.240 
moon face you can see it's all covered
now<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:50.569> all<00:02:50.720> black<00:02:51.019> which<00:02:51.410> means<00:02:51.709> there's<00:02:52.190> a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
now it's all black which means there's a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.190 
now it's all black which means there's a
new<00:02:52.340> moon<00:02:54.280> when<00:02:55.280> there<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:56.120> nothing<00:02:56.750> covered

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
new moon when there is nothing covered

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.319 
new moon when there is nothing covered
so<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:58.010> completely<00:02:58.580> empty<00:02:58.790> there's<00:02:59.180> no

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
so it's completely empty there's no

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.479 
so it's completely empty there's no
black<00:02:59.599> parts<00:03:00.049> there<00:03:00.319> it's<00:03:01.040> full<00:03:01.340> moon

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
black parts there it's full moon

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.240 
black parts there it's full moon
depending<00:03:04.489> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.510> moon<00:03:05.900> phase<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
depending on the moon phase and the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.759 
depending on the moon phase and the
watch<00:03:07.610> calculates<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.690> best<00:03:08.720> time<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.680> you

to<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.069> fishing<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:11.360> has<00:03:11.599> something<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.049> do

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
to go fishing it has something to do

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.670 
to go fishing it has something to do
with<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.620> tides<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.000> water<00:03:14.680> so

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
with the tides of the of the water so

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.660 
with the tides of the of the water so
with<00:03:15.860> full<00:03:16.099> moon<00:03:16.340> or<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.720> new<00:03:17.930> moon<00:03:17.959> is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
with full moon or when the new moon is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.319 
with full moon or when the new moon is
there<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:21.200> will<00:03:21.230> see<00:03:21.440> all<00:03:21.829> these<00:03:22.220> fishes<00:03:22.819> here

chance of catching a fish okay you see
the<00:03:38.480> temperature<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.019> dropping<00:03:39.230> because<00:03:39.680> I'm

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
the temperature is dropping because I'm

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.039 
the temperature is dropping because I'm
not<00:03:40.250> wearing<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:40.819> watch<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.359> my<00:03:41.480> wrist<00:03:41.510> at

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880

you<00:06:23.880> can<00:06:24.060> of<00:06:24.180> course<00:06:24.210> at<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.750> end<00:06:24.780> load<00:06:25.080> time

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
you can of course at the end load time

zone also to the time zone that you are
in<00:06:27.660> but<00:06:27.870> then<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:28.200> have<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.500> analog<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:29.130> the

digital time zone displaying the same

digital time zone displaying the same
time<00:06:31.889> which<00:06:32.160> is<00:06:32.340> a<00:06:32.370> little<00:06:32.760> bit<00:06:32.820> useless<00:06:33.300> in<00:06:33.479> my

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
time which is a little bit useless in my

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.159 
time which is a little bit useless in my
eyes<00:06:33.810> but<00:06:34.139> that's<00:06:34.650> just<00:06:34.860> my<00:06:35.100> opinion<00:06:35.510> as<00:06:36.510> you

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
eyes but that's just my opinion as you

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.020 
eyes but that's just my opinion as you
can<00:06:37.470> see<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.770> moonface<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.520> now<00:06:38.729> totally

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
can see the moonface is now totally

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.629 
can see the moonface is now totally
empty<00:06:39.510> if<00:06:39.770> you<00:06:40.770> would<00:06:41.040> see<00:06:41.220> this<00:06:41.370> in

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
empty if you would see this in

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.879 
empty if you would see this in
timekeeping<00:06:42.540> mode<00:06:42.600> it<00:06:42.990> would<00:06:43.169> mean<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:43.740> it's

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
timekeeping mode it would mean that it's

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.820 
timekeeping mode it would mean that it's
a<00:06:44.040> full<00:06:44.280> moon<00:06:44.490> and<00:06:44.790> it's<00:06:45.600> it's<00:06:45.960> always<00:06:46.560> right

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
a full moon and it's it's always right

a full moon and it's it's always right
when<00:06:47.370> you<00:06:47.550> when<00:06:47.850> you<00:06:47.970> look<00:06:48.120> at<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.560> indicator
