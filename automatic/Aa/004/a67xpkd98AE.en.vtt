00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.849
 I made the ice cream pot 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.820
 You see I found it very interesting. 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.830
 I liked it and I decided to share it with you. 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 I think everyone has a tablet today. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 No, but I wonder who has a support? 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 for the tablet 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.210
 Look how beautiful I got cut the pot. 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 I left this space to support 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.140

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.180
 this time and here a little bit more 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.130
