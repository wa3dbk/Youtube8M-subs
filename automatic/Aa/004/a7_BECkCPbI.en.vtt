00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.349
 sometimes we don't notice we have gods 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.509
 double bonds 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.730
 what it means we seem to be 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.070
 bound to a situation by a bond 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.230
 actually they are two but you know what the thing is 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.539
 worst is that when we complain 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.089
 because a bond prevents us from doing 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.710
 something and we say that that bond is 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.170
 the problem 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.080
 the problem is not that link but is the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.839
 second link what we have created 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.690
 us because this is really 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.789
 paradoxical when we take it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.570
 for something, for example, we are 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.250
 arguing 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.809
 let's say we fight because there is one 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.850
 that makes us fight 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.219
 attention this seems the link and the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.399
 make another bond if you stay 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 you are the second bond by fighting 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.350
 you who put yourself in that situation 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.280
 whenever you are in a condition that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.860
 you don't like it there is the second bond 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.080
 because the first link is obvious 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 that makes you think you're inside 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.119
 that situation with those limits but the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.610
 question is what you do with that 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.340
 situation and why you renew the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.340
 conviction of having those limits understand 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.849
 sometimes you're stuck there but not for 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.509
 always 

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:34.330
 besides parrying the other point of view 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.310
 when touching your point of view e 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.110
 put the conditions to change the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.569
 situation 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 now never describe the reality that you 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.789
 it only blocks by means of a bond 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 when you notice that there is something that you 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.099
 it blocks beyond the obvious bond 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.739
 look for the second link because that 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.319
 that you have to dissolve and you can do it because 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:59.200
 the second link you created that you 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.390
 second link is your availability a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.629
 remain bound to something that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.629
 I do not like
