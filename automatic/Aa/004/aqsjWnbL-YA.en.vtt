to like help your lanes this has been
for<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> power<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.260> farm<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> with

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
for you to power a farm and this is with

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
for you to power a farm and this is with
ye<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.849> he's<00:00:27.029> probably<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.660> fastest

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
ye and so he's probably the fastest

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.279 
ye and so he's probably the fastest
possible<00:00:28.650> um<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> show

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
possible um but this is going to show

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.030 
possible um but this is going to show
you<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> ridiculousness<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.770> actually<00:00:34.770> how

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you the ridiculousness of actually how

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
you the ridiculousness of actually how
fast<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.780> start<00:00:36.870> at

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
fast you can go so I'm going to start at

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.540 
fast you can go so I'm going to start at
35<00:00:37.680> 45<00:00:38.219> 30<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> place<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> ward

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.459 

and<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.420> alt<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.140> well

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
from buff to buff just giving you the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
from buff to buff just giving you the
maximum<00:01:00.629> speed<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.710> how<00:01:01.949> stuff<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
maximum speed on just like how stuff is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
maximum speed on just like how stuff is
you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.180> crits<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.960> things

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you can get crits you could get things

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870 
you can get crits you could get things
that<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.439> speed<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.769> hopefully<00:01:05.519> nunu

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that would speed you up hopefully nunu

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.719 
that would speed you up hopefully nunu
doesn't<00:01:06.210> annoy<00:01:06.990> me<00:01:07.310> um<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> yeah<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.189> right

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
doesn't annoy me um but yeah so right

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.570 
doesn't annoy me um but yeah so right
now<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.570> through<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:13.020> entire<00:01:13.580> one

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
now I have been through my entire one

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.670 
now I have been through my entire one
side<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.330> less<00:01:15.659> than<00:01:15.840> 30<00:01:16.080> seconds

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.010 

and<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> partially<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.570> I'd<00:01:24.780> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and this is partially you know I'd you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.110 
and this is partially you know I'd you
might<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.350> slower<00:01:25.620> based<00:01:25.920> off<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.340> items<00:01:26.670> but

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
might be slower based off like items but

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.390 
might be slower based off like items but
I<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> money<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.070> inventory

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I have a lot of money in my inventory

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.680 
I have a lot of money in my inventory
but<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:32.330> normally<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:33.570> would

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
but I also not and normally you would

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.120 
but I also not and normally you would
use<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.080> tower<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:37.130> get

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
use the tower that's right here to get

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.290 
use the tower that's right here to get
here<00:01:39.650> basically<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.369> reduce<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
here basically you would reduce the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.969 
here basically you would reduce the
cooldown<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.170> long<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.530> take<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
cooldown on how long it would take so it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.969 
cooldown on how long it would take so it
was<00:01:44.070> 180<00:01:44.640> seconds<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.360> use<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:46.650> like

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
was 180 seconds to use this this like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.780 
was 180 seconds to use this this like
method<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.520> method

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
method and you can see that this method

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
method and you can see that this method
is<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.300> fast<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.080> am<00:01:52.229> able<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.650> do<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is so fast that I am able to do it and I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.139 
is so fast that I am able to do it and I
am<00:01:53.850> waiting<00:01:54.600> waiting<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> camps<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
am waiting waiting on the camps to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.560 
am waiting waiting on the camps to
spawned<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.190> not<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> faster<00:02:00.149> method<00:02:00.300> i

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
spawned there is not a faster method i

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830 
spawned there is not a faster method i
have<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.080> entire<00:02:01.560> jungle<00:02:02.369> cleared<00:02:02.880> there's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
have my entire jungle cleared there's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.710 
have my entire jungle cleared there's
there's<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> faster<00:02:05.009> method<00:02:05.160> I<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.539> to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
there's not a faster method I I have to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.340 
there's not a faster method I I have to
wait<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.560> buffs<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.039> respawn<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> now

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
wait on the buffs to respawn and so now

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.650 
wait on the buffs to respawn and so now
i'm<00:02:11.100> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.580> use<00:02:11.820> smite<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> one

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
i'm going to use smite on that one

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.380 
i'm going to use smite on that one
because<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.230> know<00:02:13.320> might<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.739> well<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.910> so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
because you know might as well but so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.090 
because you know might as well but so
I'm<00:02:15.480> waiting<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.840> white<00:02:16.050> ball<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.070> was

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
part of this which is important when

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.170 
part of this which is important when
your<00:02:30.570> teleport<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> not<00:02:31.739> up<00:02:31.950> repeat<00:02:32.640> NOT<00:02:32.970> up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
your teleport is not up repeat NOT up

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.199 
your teleport is not up repeat NOT up
you<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.930> Home<00:02:34.170> Guard<00:02:34.470> boots<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.150> now<00:02:36.150> you

you have Home Guard boots and now you

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.270 
you have Home Guard boots and now you
get<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> movement<00:02:36.780> speed<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.070> going

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
get the movement speed and you are going

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.340 
get the movement speed and you are going
to<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.670> back<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.209> remember<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:41.269> 4530

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to get back to remember as a it was 4530

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.930 
to get back to remember as a it was 4530
spend<00:02:43.350> two<00:02:43.530> minutes<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.280> gotten<00:02:44.640> 10

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
spend two minutes I have gotten 10

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.140 
spend two minutes I have gotten 10
stacks<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.810> my<00:02:46.170> fire<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> flare<00:02:46.739> 10<00:02:47.430> stacks<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
stacks on my fire a flare 10 stacks and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.819 
stacks on my fire a flare 10 stacks and
then<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:50.120> about<00:02:51.120> two<00:02:51.360> minutes<00:02:51.570> now<00:02:54.590> i'm<00:02:55.590> gonna

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
then in about two minutes now i'm gonna

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:08.120 
then in about two minutes now i'm gonna
hit<00:02:56.519> my<00:02:56.760> alt<00:03:05.269> dump<00:03:06.269> them<00:03:06.540> done<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.799> about<00:03:07.950> two

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
hit my alt dump them done it's about two

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.870 
hit my alt dump them done it's about two
and<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.250> half<00:03:08.280> minutes<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:09.650> 12<00:03:10.700> stacks<00:03:11.700> in

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
and a half minutes that's 12 stacks in

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:22.100 
and a half minutes that's 12 stacks in
two<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> half<00:03:12.209> minutes<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> could<00:03:22.019> have

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
two and a half minutes now I could have

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.560 
two and a half minutes now I could have
used<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.320> sooner<00:03:27.200> now<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.260> gonna<00:03:28.410> go<00:03:28.560> be<00:03:29.570> so

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
used that sooner now I'm gonna go be so

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.300 
used that sooner now I'm gonna go be so
yeah<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.260> um<00:03:33.320> 16<00:03:34.320> stacks<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:35.070> three

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
yeah so that's um 16 stacks in three

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.900 
yeah so that's um 16 stacks in three
minutes<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:38.310> we're<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.579> going<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:38.820> keep

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
minutes and we're just going to keep

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.420 
minutes and we're just going to keep
going<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.269> little<00:03:39.419> bit<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.130> just<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> show

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
going a little bit just to just to show

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.580 
going a little bit just to just to show
just<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.730> methodology<00:03:42.570> I'm<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.560> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just the methodology I'm gonna do to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.949 
just the methodology I'm gonna do to
that<00:03:43.739> there<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:45.090> makes<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.359> slow<00:03:45.600> alright

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
that there that makes it slow alright

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.500 
that there that makes it slow alright
what<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.139> just<00:03:46.350> did<00:03:46.500> made<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.889> slower<00:03:47.209> um<00:03:48.209> but

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
what I just did made it slower um but

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.430 
what I just did made it slower um but
yeah<00:03:48.720> notice<00:03:49.290> how<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.560> would<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.889> up<00:03:50.010> again

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
yeah notice how this would be up again

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.470 
yeah notice how this would be up again
so<00:03:52.440> basically<00:03:55.760> what<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.000> showed<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.239> is

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
so basically what I just showed you is

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.909 
so basically what I just showed you is
you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.139> get<00:03:59.600> some<00:04:00.600> really<00:04:00.720> fast<00:04:01.230> math<00:04:01.560> would

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
you can get some really fast math would

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.689 
you can get some really fast math would
be<00:04:02.209> 16<00:04:03.209> stacks<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.959> about<00:04:04.139> three<00:04:04.380> minutes<00:04:04.699> and

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
be 16 stacks in about three minutes and

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.150 
be 16 stacks in about three minutes and
then<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.299> can<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:06.660> another<00:04:06.840> 18<00:04:07.590> there<00:04:07.949> eight

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
then you can get another 18 there eight

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.020 
then you can get another 18 there eight
stacks<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.940> about<00:04:09.329> another<00:04:10.010> men<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> half

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.969 

so<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.239> means<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:16.280> minute<00:04:17.540> 18<00:04:19.790> let's<00:04:20.790> see

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
so that means that minute 18 let's see

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.659 
so that means that minute 18 let's see
16<00:04:24.410> plus<00:04:25.410> eight<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:26.370> twenty-four<00:04:28.100> 24<00:04:29.100> stacks

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
16 plus eight is twenty-four 24 stacks

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.959 
16 plus eight is twenty-four 24 stacks
in<00:04:30.240> about<00:04:30.979> six<00:04:31.979> or<00:04:32.100> seven<00:04:32.220> minutes

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.339 

so<00:04:35.509> and<00:04:36.879> 24<00:04:37.879> stacks<00:04:38.269> once<00:04:38.839> you've<00:04:39.049> built<00:04:39.229> this

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
so and 24 stacks once you've built this

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.499 
so and 24 stacks once you've built this
out<00:04:39.649> is<00:04:39.919> going<00:04:40.189> to<00:04:40.339> give<00:04:40.489> you<00:04:40.639> an<00:04:40.789> extra<00:04:41.089> I

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
out is going to give you an extra I

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.229 
out is going to give you an extra I
don't<00:04:44.509> know<00:04:45.099> 24<00:04:46.099> stacks<00:04:46.369> I<00:04:46.579> think<00:04:46.610> gives<00:04:46.999> you<00:04:47.209> a

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:47.239 
don't know 24 stacks I think gives you a

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:52.779 
don't know 24 stacks I think gives you a
hundred<00:04:47.869> and<00:04:51.219> basically<00:04:52.219> you're<00:04:52.339> going<00:04:52.699> to

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
hundred and basically you're going to

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.749 
hundred and basically you're going to
increase<00:04:53.209> your<00:04:53.239> fire<00:04:53.629> flares<00:04:53.959> up<00:04:57.489> strength<00:04:58.489> by

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
increase your fire flares up strength by

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.100 
increase your fire flares up strength by
a<00:04:58.789> huge<00:04:59.419> amount<00:04:59.809> so<00:05:00.349> yeah<00:05:01.629> that's<00:05:02.629> the<00:05:02.899> fire

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
a huge amount so yeah that's the fire

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.899 
a huge amount so yeah that's the fire
flare<00:05:03.469> and<00:05:03.769> I<00:05:04.099> hope<00:05:04.279> you<00:05:04.399> guys<00:05:04.459> enjoyed<00:05:04.819> the
