00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
on after my setting powder this isn't a

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.690 
on after my setting powder this isn't a
tutorial<00:01:48.929> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.670> makeup

tutorial this is just how I do my makeup
and<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> important<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> apply

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
and I think it's important just to apply

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.260 
and I think it's important just to apply
concealer<00:01:54.569> where<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.259> needed<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:57.029> do

eyes because I have freckles there and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.269 
eyes because I have freckles there and
that<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:03.869> look<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.049> weird<00:02:04.709> just<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.099> have

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
that will look really weird just to have

that will look really weird just to have
like<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.490> triangle<00:02:06.179> shape<00:02:06.389> type<00:02:07.139> thing<00:02:07.469> and

bow and I just think that adds a really
nice<00:06:06.270> glow<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.080> makes<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:08.040> look<00:06:08.250> look<00:06:08.760> way

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
nice glow and makes the look look way

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
day-to-day basis but that will be a very

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.170 
day-to-day basis but that will be a very
short<00:06:25.530> video<00:06:25.980> so<00:06:26.460> this

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
short video so this

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.029 
short video so this
if<00:06:27.449> I<00:06:27.600> just<00:06:27.840> want<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.229> be<00:06:28.350> a<00:06:28.380> little<00:06:28.650> bit<00:06:28.860> more

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
if I just want to be a little bit more

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.870 
if I just want to be a little bit more
extra<00:06:29.910> put<00:06:30.389> a<00:06:30.419> little<00:06:30.720> bit<00:06:30.900> more<00:06:31.139> time<00:06:31.440> into<00:06:31.830> it

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
extra put a little bit more time into it

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.340 
extra put a little bit more time into it
but<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:32.940> think<00:06:33.240> it's<00:06:33.389> important<00:06:33.870> not<00:06:33.990> to<00:06:34.050> wear

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
but I think it's important not to wear

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.320 
but I think it's important not to wear
makeup<00:06:34.650> every<00:06:35.100> day<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.729> let<00:06:35.880> your<00:06:36.060> skin
