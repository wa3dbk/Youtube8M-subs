00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
specific glitch is in Chapter 7 a couple

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.089 
specific glitch is in Chapter 7 a couple
of<00:00:12.000> rooms<00:00:12.210> after<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> AI<00:00:12.929> core<00:00:13.349> room<00:00:13.620> another

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
of rooms after the AI core room another

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
of rooms after the AI core room another
one<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.670> destroy<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.599> fuses

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
one where you have to destroy the fuses

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.670 
one where you have to destroy the fuses
to<00:00:16.590> show<00:00:16.770> off<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> security<00:00:17.340> system<00:00:18.680> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to show off the security system this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.220 
to show off the security system this
which<00:00:19.980> isn't<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:20.939> nearly<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.689> good<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
which isn't really nearly as good as the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679 
which isn't really nearly as good as the
infinite<00:00:22.769> power<00:00:22.949> node<00:00:23.220> glitch<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.850> chapter<00:00:24.240> 14

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
infinite power node glitch in chapter 14

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230 
infinite power node glitch in chapter 14
but<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> chapter<00:00:26.369> 7<00:00:26.820> way<00:00:26.939> sooner

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
but now this is a chapter 7 way sooner

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.019 
but now this is a chapter 7 way sooner
you<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.410> need<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.890> power<00:00:29.189> node<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.849> able<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you do need one power node to be able to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
you do need one power node to be able to
do<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.269> glitch<00:00:30.510> though<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.340> since<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.550> have

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
do this glitch though and since you have

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.819 
do this glitch though and since you have
to<00:00:32.790> repeatedly<00:00:33.329> save<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.079> while<00:00:34.469> doing

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
to repeatedly save your game while doing

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.040 
to repeatedly save your game while doing
this<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.329> can't<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.960> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this you know you can't really do it in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.130 
this you know you can't really do it in
hardcore<00:00:38.059> alright<00:00:39.059> Oh<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.780> things<00:00:40.050> first

hardcore alright Oh first things first
is<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.890> make<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> quick<00:00:41.610> save<00:00:41.940> file<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.629> at

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
is just make a quick save file here at

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.389 
is just make a quick save file here at
this<00:00:42.930> safe<00:00:43.170> port<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> case<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this safe port just you know in case you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.520 
this safe port just you know in case you
mess<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> before<00:00:49.410> you've

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mess up you can go back to before you've

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.330 
mess up you can go back to before you've
done<00:00:49.559> anything<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:51.770> save<00:00:52.770> losses<00:00:53.160> right

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
done anything at all save losses right

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
done anything at all save losses right
there<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> note<00:00:55.320> room<00:00:55.680> right

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
there and there is the note room right

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.479 
there and there is the note room right
here<00:00:56.989> alright<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.219> use

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
here alright so what you do is just use

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
here alright so what you do is just use
a<00:00:59.520> node<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.359> unlock<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.079> door<00:01:02.930> open<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> door

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a node to unlock this door open the door

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
a node to unlock this door open the door
and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.129> use<00:01:05.720> Kinesis<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.650> pick<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and then use Kinesis to pick up the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
and then use Kinesis to pick up the
money<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> credits<00:01:10.140> rather

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
money that's for the credits rather

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
money that's for the credits rather
that's<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> shelf<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.869> it's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that's on the shelf right there it's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.359 
that's on the shelf right there it's
easier<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> use<00:01:13.409> Kinesis<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> don't

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
easier to use Kinesis that way you don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.539 
easier to use Kinesis that way you don't
accidentally<00:01:14.790> pick<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.180> something<00:01:15.420> else<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
accidentally pick up something else and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
accidentally pick up something else and
that<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.210> open<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> door

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that way you don't have to open the door

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.530 
that way you don't have to open the door
in<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> room<00:01:20.400> once<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.360> pick

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
in to get out of the room once you pick

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.609 
in to get out of the room once you pick
up<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> credits<00:01:22.170> come<00:01:22.830> over<00:01:23.130> save<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.970> game

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
up the credits come over save your game

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.640 
up the credits come over save your game
do<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> different<00:01:26.040> file

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.370 

after<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.460> saves<00:01:31.870> checkpoint<00:01:32.870> restored

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
after it saves checkpoint restored

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.070 
after it saves checkpoint restored
really<00:01:33.980> quick<00:01:34.190> you're<00:01:34.400> right<00:01:34.580> back<00:01:34.790> here<00:01:35.090> open

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
really quick you're right back here open

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.870 
really quick you're right back here open
this<00:01:36.200> door<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:38.830> if<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:39.980> look<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.460> money<00:01:40.700> is

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
this door and if you look the money is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.010 
this door and if you look the money is
back<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.500> there's<00:01:42.500> two<00:01:43.190> semiconductors<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
back and there's two semiconductors and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.170 
back and there's two semiconductors and
there's<00:01:45.230> actually<00:01:45.680> each<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.100> those<00:01:46.220> crates<00:01:46.670> is

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
there's actually each of those crates is

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.630 
there's actually each of those crates is
actually<00:01:47.690> two<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.230> I<00:01:48.320> were<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.530> shoot<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.860> you

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
actually two if I were to shoot it you

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.670 
actually two if I were to shoot it you
know<00:01:49.730> all<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.120> sudden<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:50.630> would<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.020> pop

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
know all of a sudden one would like pop

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.230 
know all of a sudden one would like pop
out<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.920> nowhere<00:01:52.040> like<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.790> two<00:01:52.970> were<00:01:53.090> just

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
out of nowhere like the two were just

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.800 
out of nowhere like the two were just
ghosting<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:53.810> top<00:01:54.050> of<00:01:54.170> each<00:01:54.260> other<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.810> yeah

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
ghosting on top of each other so yeah

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.670 
ghosting on top of each other so yeah
just<00:01:57.230> like<00:01:57.350> before<00:01:58.600> grab<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.780> money<00:01:59.960> with

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
just like before grab the money with

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.350 
just like before grab the money with
Kinesis<00:02:01.600> run<00:02:02.600> back<00:02:02.810> over<00:02:02.960> here<00:02:03.290> save<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.100> game

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
Kinesis run back over here save the game

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:16.720 
Kinesis run back over here save the game
once<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.510> saves<00:02:05.800> reload<00:02:15.130> what's<00:02:16.130> happening<00:02:16.580> I

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
once it saves reload what's happening I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.810 
once it saves reload what's happening I
don't<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.120> how<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.570> every<00:02:18.290> time<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
don't really know how but every time you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.850 
don't really know how but every time you
pick<00:02:19.820> up<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> money<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.300> save<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.690> game<00:02:20.860> one

pick up the money and save the game one
more<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.400> everything<00:02:22.520> appears<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.570> now<00:02:23.690> you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
more of everything appears so now you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
more of everything appears so now you
can<00:02:23.960> see<00:02:24.140> there's<00:02:24.350> four<00:02:24.980> if<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> look<00:02:25.490> at<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
can see there's four if you look at the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.750 
can see there's four if you look at the
corner<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> top<00:02:26.720> left<00:02:27.020> right<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.760> you

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
corner on the top left right there you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.830 
corner on the top left right there you
can<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.120> there's<00:02:29.420> four<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.840> them<00:02:30.050> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
can see that there's four of them and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.229 
can see that there's four of them and
again<00:02:32.840> each<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.260> those<00:02:33.380> should<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:33.890> be<00:02:34.370> three

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
again each of those should now be three

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.199 
again each of those should now be three
or<00:02:35.390> four<00:02:35.630> on<00:02:35.900> top<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.290> each<00:02:36.380> other<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.209> you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
or four on top of each other so you

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.870 
or four on top of each other so you
choose<00:02:38.450> money<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.830> really<00:02:40.160> just<00:02:40.370> repeat<00:02:40.700> this

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
choose money and really just repeat this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.020 
choose money and really just repeat this
over<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.690> over<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.080> over<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.610> can't<00:02:43.850> do<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
over and over and over you can't do a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.550 
over and over and over you can't do a
whole<00:02:44.270> lot<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.720> conductor's<00:02:45.260> that's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
whole lot with the conductor's that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.590 
whole lot with the conductor's that's
just<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.220> visible<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.209> see<00:02:47.450> that

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
just it's visible so you can see that

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.870 
just it's visible so you can see that
everything<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:47.959> duplicating<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.670> since

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
everything is duplicating but since

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.580

there is no story around here you can't
sell<00:02:51.890> them<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.780> build<00:02:54.080> up<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.410> lot
