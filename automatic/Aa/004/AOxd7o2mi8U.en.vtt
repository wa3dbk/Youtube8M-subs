00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.070 
right back to where it was so it's uh
once<00:06:51.580> it's<00:06:51.820> implemented<00:06:52.390> will<00:06:52.510> be<00:06:52.630> very<00:06:52.870> quick

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
once it's implemented will be very quick

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.760 
once it's implemented will be very quick
to<00:06:53.260> turn<00:06:53.440> on<00:06:53.710> and<00:06:53.890> off<00:06:54.010> and<00:06:55.560> there's<00:06:56.560> a<00:06:56.650> lot

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
to turn on and off and there's a lot

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.870 
to turn on and off and there's a lot
more<00:06:56.830> I<00:06:57.040> can<00:06:57.250> possibly<00:06:57.640> do<00:06:57.790> for<00:06:57.820> it<00:06:58.240> anyways
