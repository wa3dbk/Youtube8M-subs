00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.890 
my god she is nowhere do you ask
I<00:00:10.820> think<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.910> asked<00:00:12.210> around<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> footwear

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I think you asked around the footwear

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020 
I think you asked around the footwear
area<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.469> side<00:00:13.710> looks<00:00:13.950> pretty<00:00:14.219> good<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
area this side looks pretty good the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.220 
area this side looks pretty good the
other<00:00:15.059> side<00:00:15.509> there's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> little<00:00:16.020> bit<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
other side there's a little bit of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.180 
other side there's a little bit of
bubbly<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.529> I'll<00:00:16.619> show<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
bubbly and I'll show you that in a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.000 
bubbly and I'll show you that in a
second

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.269 

yeah<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.539> nice<00:00:24.859> Sidda<00:00:25.859> hasn't<00:00:26.160> been

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
yeah it's it's nice Sidda hasn't been

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.980 
yeah it's it's nice Sidda hasn't been
resprayed<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> last<00:00:27.150> eight<00:00:27.599> years<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.189> it

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
resprayed in the last eight years but it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.909 
resprayed in the last eight years but it
looks<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.169> pretty<00:00:31.500> good

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
looks like a pretty good

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.680 
looks like a pretty good
a<00:00:31.950> recent<00:00:32.550> respray<00:00:32.970> job<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> could<00:00:33.600> be

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a recent respray job but I could be

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.049 
a recent respray job but I could be
wrong<00:00:33.720> so<00:00:34.680> underneath<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.940> bit

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
wrong so underneath there's a little bit

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
wrong so underneath there's a little bit
of<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.690> looks<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.020> they've<00:00:37.170> done<00:00:37.320> some

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of it looks like they've done some

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160 
of it looks like they've done some
protection<00:00:38.160> work<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.579> mean<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> can't<00:00:39.150> see<00:00:40.019> any

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
protection work I mean I can't see any

00:00:40.170 --> 00:01:01.100 
protection work I mean I can't see any
signs<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:41.180> really<00:00:42.180> rusty<00:00:42.540> stuff<00:00:42.809> under<00:00:43.140> there

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.310 

in<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.290> back<00:01:02.640> yeah<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:04.050> struts<00:01:05.050> the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
in the back yeah that struts the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680 
in the back yeah that struts the
hydraulic<00:01:05.970> struts<00:01:06.970> probably<00:01:07.240> need<00:01:07.360> replacing

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
hydraulic struts probably need replacing

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.170 
hydraulic struts probably need replacing
their<00:01:08.020> look<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.130> look<00:01:09.250> pretty<00:01:09.580> good<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.790> here<00:01:10.150> I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
their look so look pretty good in here I

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.930 
their look so look pretty good in here I
mean<00:01:10.300> there's<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.570> little<00:01:10.810> bit<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.700> call

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
mean there's a little bit of we call

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.520 
mean there's a little bit of we call
that<00:01:13.150> cracking<00:01:14.280> around<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.900> looks<00:01:17.140> down<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
that cracking around it looks down the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.440 
that cracking around it looks down the
back<00:01:17.770> there<00:01:18.040> like<00:01:18.190> there<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.910> don't<00:01:19.180> know<00:01:19.330> if

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
back there like there I don't know if

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.900 
back there like there I don't know if
it's<00:01:19.600> naturally<00:01:20.110> sprayed<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.670> sprayed

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
it's naturally sprayed if it's sprayed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.969 
it's naturally sprayed if it's sprayed
with<00:01:22.090> fish<00:01:22.330> oil<00:01:22.630> or<00:01:22.840> rust<00:01:23.290> protector<00:01:23.650> from<00:01:23.830> the

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
with fish oil or rust protector from the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.900 
with fish oil or rust protector from the
shop<00:01:24.190> but<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:24.550> it's<00:01:25.210> got<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.600> fish<00:01:26.320> oil

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
shop but it's it's got that fish oil

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.660 
shop but it's it's got that fish oil
spray<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:27.970> there<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.380> that's<00:01:29.530> what's<00:01:30.430> down

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
spray in there and that's what's down

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
spray in there and that's what's down
here<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:32.850> probably<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> good<00:01:34.000> thing<00:01:36.119> underneath

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here to probably a good thing underneath

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.400 
here to probably a good thing underneath
it<00:01:38.619> looks<00:01:38.860> all<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:40.180> reasonably<00:01:40.780> clean<00:01:41.140> in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
it looks all all reasonably clean in

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.980 
it looks all all reasonably clean in
here

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.350 

and<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.760> not<00:01:47.940> really<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.330> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and like was it's not really much to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.289 
and like was it's not really much to
seen<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.520> doesn't<00:01:50.729> look<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.119> there's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
seen there and doesn't look like there's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.500 
seen there and doesn't look like there's
any<00:01:51.479> rust<00:01:52.159> underneath<00:01:53.159> here

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:05.410 

so<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.810> looks<00:01:58.729> reasonably<00:01:59.729> good<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.150> there

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.660 

once<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> different<00:02:07.470> badging

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.339 

a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> blemish<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:12.990> something

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
a little bit of a blemish or something

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.309 
a little bit of a blemish or something
in<00:02:13.470> there

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.479 

so<00:02:19.860> once<00:02:20.849> again<00:02:21.030> around<00:02:21.510> here<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:23.129> all<00:02:23.250> looks

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
so once again around here it all looks

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.540 
so once again around here it all looks
pretty<00:02:24.019> pretty<00:02:25.019> good

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
pretty pretty good

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.380 
pretty pretty good
with<00:02:26.910> no<00:02:27.090> sponsor<00:02:27.600> my<00:02:27.900> trust

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.860 

now<00:02:32.870> at<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> front<00:02:33.560> there

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.720 

it's<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.050> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.500> bubbly<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.519> just

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it's a little bit of bubbly it's just

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440 
it's a little bit of bubbly it's just
starting<00:02:38.180> around<00:02:38.300> here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.620 

I<00:02:42.500> mean<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> looked<00:02:43.770> in<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.390> not

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
I mean I looked in there and it's not

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.740 
I mean I looked in there and it's not
really<00:02:45.900> all<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.319> through<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.360> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
really all the way through so it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.479 
really all the way through so it's
probably<00:02:49.250> right<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.430> start<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:52.340> picked<00:02:53.340> up

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
probably right at the start I picked up

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.520 
probably right at the start I picked up
and<00:02:53.670> had<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> look<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.420> mean<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.660> that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and had a look in here I mean that that

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.070 
and had a look in here I mean that that
all<00:02:55.680> looks<00:02:55.890> pretty<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.900> yet

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
all looks pretty good in there so yet

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.699 
all looks pretty good in there so yet
inside<00:02:58.500> all<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.220> nice<00:02:59.370> a<00:03:00.319> couple<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.440> tiny

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
inside all really nice a couple of tiny

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.390 
inside all really nice a couple of tiny
hairline<00:03:02.280> cracks<00:03:02.670> around<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.980> aircon

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
hairline cracks around here the aircon

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.320 
hairline cracks around here the aircon
works<00:03:06.620> there's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.709> lid<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.220> roof

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.200 

doesn't<00:03:11.990> look<00:03:12.080> like<00:03:12.140> there's<00:03:12.530> any<00:03:13.210> any

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
doesn't look like there's any any

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.370 
doesn't look like there's any any
leaking<00:03:14.690> from<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.990> roof

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
leaking from the roof

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.890 
leaking from the roof
it<00:03:15.710> all<00:03:15.860> looks<00:03:16.070> pretty<00:03:16.310> good<00:03:18.400> may<00:03:19.400> even<00:03:19.610> be<00:03:19.730> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
it all looks pretty good may even be a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.510 
it all looks pretty good may even be a
don't<00:03:20.900> know<00:03:20.990> if<00:03:21.050> it's<00:03:21.140> new<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.350> not

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:35.350 

all<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.090> wheels<00:03:26.300> look<00:03:26.480> pretty<00:03:26.750> good

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.590 

so<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.200> seats<00:03:36.500> got<00:03:36.770> a<00:03:36.830> little<00:03:37.070> bit<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.600> just

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
so the seats got a little bit of a just

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.930 
so the seats got a little bit of a just
starting<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.050> come<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:40.100> bit<00:03:40.730> more

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
starting to come up there a bit more

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.480 
starting to come up there a bit more
where<00:03:41.240> I<00:03:41.270> guess<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.840> could<00:03:42.020> clean<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.130> up

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.240 

under<00:03:46.490> there<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.819> all<00:03:46.940> looks<00:03:47.150> pretty<00:03:47.270> good

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.360 

it'll<00:03:51.250> look<00:03:51.460> good<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.540> think<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:57.100> got<00:03:57.250> an

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
it'll look good so I think I just got an

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.290 
it'll look good so I think I just got an
email<00:03:57.490> off<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:00.970> just<00:04:01.150> see<00:04:01.270> a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
email off you so you can just see a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.590 
email off you so you can just see a
little<00:04:01.420> bits<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:02.100> some<00:04:03.100> like<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.820> little<00:04:04.480> bit

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
little bits of it some like a little bit

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.110 
little bits of it some like a little bit
of<00:04:04.690> overspray<00:04:05.080> above<00:04:05.560> sure<00:04:05.950> exactly<00:04:06.640> Lynch

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
of overspray above sure exactly Lynch

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.550 
of overspray above sure exactly Lynch
original<00:04:07.630> color<00:04:07.840> could<00:04:08.590> be<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:10.470> certainly<00:04:11.470> a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
original color could be but certainly a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.120 
original color could be but certainly a
very<00:04:12.340> good<00:04:12.460> condition<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.650> paint<00:04:14.920> job<00:04:15.100> was

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
very good condition the paint job was

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:26.550 
very good condition the paint job was
done<00:04:15.400> eight<00:04:15.550> years<00:04:15.790> ago

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.260 

let<00:04:26.800> me<00:04:26.889> just<00:04:27.070> put<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.340> cameras<00:04:27.670> in<00:04:27.790> there

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:44.580 

a<00:04:40.960> lot

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.560 

so<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> little<00:04:45.950> bit<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.160> respray<00:04:46.790> marks<00:04:47.270> along

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
so a little bit of respray marks along

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.820 
so a little bit of respray marks along
here<00:04:50.020> let's<00:04:51.020> go<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:51.200> little<00:04:51.260> bit<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.680> all<00:04:51.800> I

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
here let's go a little bit of it all I

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.830 
here let's go a little bit of it all I
like<00:04:52.070> down<00:04:52.340> there<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.730> front<00:04:52.910> just

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
like down there in the front just

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.640 
like down there in the front just
cleaned<00:04:54.140> it<00:04:54.290> up

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
cleaned it up

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.790 
cleaned it up
maybe<00:04:55.160> it's<00:04:55.340> had<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:59.200> couple<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.350> things<00:05:00.560> down

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
maybe it's had a couple of things down

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.230 
maybe it's had a couple of things down
there<00:05:01.010> like<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.220> couple<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.670> rubbers<00:05:02.060> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240

there like a couple of rubbers and
bounced<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.980> probably<00:05:03.980> are<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.190> little<00:05:04.490> bit

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
bounced that probably are a little bit

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.160 
bounced that probably are a little bit
on<00:05:04.700> their<00:05:04.850> way<00:05:05.030> out<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:07.310> got<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.460> new<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:08.170> new
