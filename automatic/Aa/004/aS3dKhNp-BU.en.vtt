00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.570
 and such tips for you to decorate your home 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.790
 this is our framework in the program in 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 focus always remembering you 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.810
 I have the honor prominent in voith is 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.390
 my side is the architect ana maria 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.180
 miller alright Marian rajoy is good 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.450
 great and wanting to be oriented 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.220
 for you and the women also goianas 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.420
 people separated some things here for 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.760
 this room is not 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 what would you put as a point 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.380
 essential for this room that people 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.210
 is to be in this she then said 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.980
 What happens wants to see when mounting 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.559
 A living room of us has to 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.570
 thinking in a general context is then 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.640
 principle we chose to talk about 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.980
 be a leather furniture that is one thing 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.600
 What advice are you using? 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.280
 because it is a mobile that has a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.820
 longer durability 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.580
 it is a sofa a timeless couch rate 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.280
 Are you going to be a good housewife? 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.260
 woman for a long time and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 It's true then it 's a couch that he's mean 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.450
 then the wild card you keep the sofa and 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.090
 With time you change the throne plays a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 own rug pattern and you get the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.590
 walk and evolve and change the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.240
 your room without losing sight of the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.400
 main feature the most 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.820
 strong room that is the sofa 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.670
 the idea today for our castes who 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.860
 we are watching is putting a sofa 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.480
 that today we speak only for three 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.620
 No, it's not like that anymore. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.470
 We already say it's a big sofa. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.710
 every three four people a more 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.530
 Obviously no limitation for this is a couch 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.360
 that fits on your wall is usually 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.480
 important that it does not occupy the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.240
 whole has a space on the sides 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.600
 who is putting a little table a support 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.820
 and here we put it in that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.190
 space we put this sofa 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.140
 we put two two more armchairs 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
 that we call and not 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.840
 those few who accompanied 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.120
 they speak 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.730
 are the drier seats are the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.379
 narrower for you to know 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.569
 when it in smaller environments 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.400
 It's okay, let's talk about the colors, it 's us. 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.189
 saw that the leather we used a 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.290
 brown could have been another light color 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.069
 and dark when I choose whether the color is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.769
 light and dark 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.859
 is this doubt a very frequent doubt 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.709
 It's very tasty, you're wearing color. 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.389
 dark because you are easy to clean 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.139
 you see the dirt is much easier 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:47.689
 but a clear sofa makes all the difference 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.120
 especially in small environments 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.269
 so the tip tip for those who are in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.310
 watching is that the sofas they have to 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.500
 be five small environments and colors 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.200
 clear because the flowers and light colors 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.980
 that make it easier to appear that the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 it's bigger 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.269
 then're a nice tip is what we 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.760
 used here too i used some ornaments 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.829
 which are silver with silver 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.810
 they stay are also kind of 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.459
 timeless and you may be trading 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.319
 then he for the pain in the blue reds 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.810
 according to what you me 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.819
 I liked that void store is that the body 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 It is very soft ness and noticed how the 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.090
 leather that well but that makes the difference 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.889
 when it's time to buy is to see what kind of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.049
 leather that you are buying and that I say 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:33.859
 much to my customers when you go 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.459
 buy a couch like that from voith senta 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.319
 It is experiment touch cup hand grasp 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.209
 you felt so comfortable and only 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.639
 has design has quality 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.409
 understood everything that we touch and 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.299
 that we feel that it is not pleasant 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.370
 do not buy because you do not have quality 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.049
 and what's cool about couch and not 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.329
 Warm up, you're not going to sit there alone. 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.560
 will be left tingling warming 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.810
 that thing to comfort so it is 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.900
 need to look is not buying is and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.669
 The good thing about voith here is that this 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.930
 these leather sofas are sofas 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.509
 pleasant 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.189
 they are soft and they are not hot it is 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:09.590
 a worry of the goiano time we 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.449
 we live in a climate it's hot she 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.489
 understood then we have to have something 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.019
 which is more pleasant and has been very 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.239
 beautiful this space let's now to 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.680
 our tv room sure will 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.680
 walk with us here form 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.009
 the arena 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.499
 ae looks yummy room here that our 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.289
 tv room as comfortable in her maria 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:37.479
 It is a very nice room that 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.659
 We can be riding in space. 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.729
 of any house any apartment and 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.919
 so the tip is the staff who are 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.139
 watching us is that the software we 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.449
 we used here was a retractable couch 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.699
 which is a retractable sofa is a sofa that 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.949
 both it open you can watch 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.599
 a tv while he closed it 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.409
 turns into a living room 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.029
 I looked then and it's very cool 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.870
 It's very important to leave this very 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.150
 clear 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.979
 Let's go to the apartments today. 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.349
 have option of doing the part of 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.379
 are apartments that are 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.139
 they are not too big you do not 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.300
 you have the option of having a living room and 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.360
 a tv room tv room the people 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 opting in the case here for leather and people 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.189
 it is worth emphasizing once again this type of 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.520
 lucky thing it does not get hot it's a 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.889
 chocolat it the more it is used 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.710
 more comfortable stay on the softer street 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.719
 The more pleasant end is the fabric of 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.599
 armchairs and we can spare 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:40.330
 entered the very beautiful is this is 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.719
 and we made a joke 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.520
 people used a mosaic with a stamp 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.639
 in the armchairs to create a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.589
 different is nice and hence a 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.300
 time if you play you can change this 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.189
 tissue put another change 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.560
 completely thrown from a rug 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:58.719
 You also chose silk threads, right? 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.319
 silk thread as I already said he has a 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.389
 Very soft touch and it's nice to go 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.610
 suppose dad and mom are sitting in the 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.259
 room are watching tv 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.870
 and then the movie is joking happily 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.029
 small son gets very focused on what 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.279
 natural jokes and will stay there 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.740
 floor on the floor then it is a 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:20.949
 space to please who is seeing now in 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.399
 charles james one is charles pictures 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:27.699
 beautiful mingus sharemula that one loves 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:31.300
 an armchair is an armchair that she 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.520
 A molejo has a very good balance and 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.990
 I really like to mention charles mistakes. 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.340
 especially when it is colored 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.460
 because the durability of it is greater 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.830
 Finding zines is a lot of designing her. 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.210
 sees it is timeless because it already already 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.940
 has been on the market for many 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.010
 supporting this is that it was drawn 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.740
 I really like the little cottage was 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.750
 that I use the couple's room a lot 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.790
 example where the husband or wife likes 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.740
 to do a reading I always say the 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.810
 charles eames with the sieve nor with the 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.570
 part of putting your feet to you is 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.880
