to put some kind of sealant there you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.270 
to put some kind of sealant there you
could<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:26.760> cause<00:00:27.180> damage<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.980> could<00:00:29.130> get

could actually cause damage it could get

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.830 
could actually cause damage it could get
stuck<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> thermostat<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.510> could<00:00:30.660> you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
stuck in the thermostat it could you

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
stuck in the thermostat it could you
know<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.560> no<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:31.860> for<00:00:32.039> it<00:00:32.309> no<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.880> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
know there's no need for it no need for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170 
know there's no need for it no need for
it<00:00:33.180> whatsoever<00:00:33.980> also<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.940> didn't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it whatsoever also one thing I didn't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.640 
it whatsoever also one thing I didn't
say<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.900> take<00:00:37.050> note<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> how

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
say was you want to take note of how

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.710 
say was you want to take note of how
this<00:00:37.860> came<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.970> go<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.630> this

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
this came off when you go to put this

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.180 
this came off when you go to put this
back<00:00:39.900> on<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> must<00:00:40.470> go<00:00:40.620> back<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> original

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
back on it must go back in the original

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.680 
back on it must go back in the original
position<00:00:41.810> or<00:00:42.810> your<00:00:42.989> hose<00:00:43.140> won't<00:00:43.380> hook<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
position or your hose won't hook back up

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.400 
position or your hose won't hook back up
so<00:00:45.690> line<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.290> all<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> three<00:00:48.410> pieces

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so line it all up with the three pieces

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
so line it all up with the three pieces
there<00:00:49.829> push<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:50.880> place<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:53.579> also

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there push it down into place you also

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
there push it down into place you also
want<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.000> make<00:00:54.120> sure<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.360> push<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.720> into

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
want to make sure you push it down into

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
want to make sure you push it down into
place<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.470> yourself<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> bolts<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
place by yourself don't use the bolts to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
place by yourself don't use the bolts to
pull<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.530> because<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.950> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
pull it down because if you do that you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
pull it down because if you do that you
could<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.640> strip<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> ball<00:01:00.480> door<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
could actually strip the ball door you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
could actually strip the ball door you
could<00:01:01.020> crack<00:01:01.380> it<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.950> plastic<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
could crack it it is plastic and if it's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.910 
could crack it it is plastic and if it's
on<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.690> properly<00:01:03.930> it'll<00:01:04.259> push<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.650> down

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
on there properly it'll push right down

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.969 
on there properly it'll push right down
and<00:01:05.659> then<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.260> ahead<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.530> install<00:01:07.680> your

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and then you go ahead and install your

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.820 
and then you go ahead and install your
three<00:01:08.280> bolts<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.510> ready<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.930> install

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
three bolts then we're ready to install

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
three bolts then we're ready to install
the<00:01:10.979> coolant<00:01:11.460> temperature<00:01:11.850> sensor<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.690> could

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the coolant temperature sensor we could

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
the coolant temperature sensor we could
have<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.440> installed<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.820> removed

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
have actually installed this or removed

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080 
have actually installed this or removed
it<00:01:15.390> after<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.750> took<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> entire<00:01:16.170> unit<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:17.090> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it after we took the entire unit out so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.609 
it after we took the entire unit out so
just<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> show<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> again<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.409> looks

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just to show you again how that looks

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
just to show you again how that looks
like<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> coolant<00:01:21.720> temperature

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like this is the coolant temperature

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
like this is the coolant temperature
sensor<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.560> fits<00:01:22.740> right<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> hole<00:01:23.430> what

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
sensor it fits right into the hole what

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
sensor it fits right into the hole what
this<00:01:24.090> does<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.350> piece<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this does this little piece here it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
this does this little piece here it
actually<00:01:26.130> measures<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.970> temperature<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
actually measures the temperature of the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
actually measures the temperature of the
coolant<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.100> next<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
coolant which it's right next to the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.240 
coolant which it's right next to the
thermostat<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.750> plugged<00:01:31.140> into<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.619> plug<00:01:32.100> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thermostat it's plugged into a plug on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
thermostat it's plugged into a plug on
the<00:01:32.369> vehicle<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> tells<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> vehicle

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the vehicle that tells the vehicle

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.920 
the vehicle that tells the vehicle
computer<00:01:34.500> how<00:01:34.950> hot<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> coolant<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
computer how hot the coolant is and this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
computer how hot the coolant is and this
does<00:01:37.140> two<00:01:37.380> things<00:01:37.409> number<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> may<00:01:38.460> tell

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
does two things number one it may tell

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
does two things number one it may tell
the<00:01:38.820> computer<00:01:39.150> how<00:01:39.299> hot<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.810> number<00:01:40.530> two

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the computer how hot it is number two

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
the computer how hot it is number two
it's<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> tell<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.700> gauge<00:01:41.880> how

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's going to tell you on your gauge how

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.249 
it's going to tell you on your gauge how
hot<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.200> comes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
hot it is so this is where that comes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
hot it is so this is where that comes
from<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> simple<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.340> sensor<00:01:44.850> some

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
from it's a simple little sensor some

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.570 
from it's a simple little sensor some
these<00:01:45.990> new<00:01:46.229> sensors<00:01:46.650> do<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:47.009> bad<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
these new sensors do go bad and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.570 
these new sensors do go bad and
sometimes<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:49.049> idea<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.590> replace

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
sometimes it is a good idea to replace

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.859 
sometimes it is a good idea to replace
those<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.390> nothing<00:01:51.540> wrong<00:01:51.810> with

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
those but there was nothing wrong with

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.420 
those but there was nothing wrong with
this<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:54.090> need<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> replace<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
this one so we don't need to replace it

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
this one so we don't need to replace it
snap<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> clip<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> how<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
snap the clip back in if you see how the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.319 
snap the clip back in if you see how the
clip<00:01:59.159> goes<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.729> holds<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.060> right<00:02:00.180> in

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
clip goes it just holds it right in

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.350 
clip goes it just holds it right in
there<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.900> normal<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> spin<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
there and it's normal for it to spin and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
there and it's normal for it to spin and
now<00:02:03.360> we've<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.930> piece<00:02:04.140> uh<00:02:04.170> ready<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> go

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
now we've got our piece uh ready to go

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.999 
now we've got our piece uh ready to go
ready<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> install<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> vehicle<00:02:07.009> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
ready to install back on the vehicle so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.220 
ready to install back on the vehicle so
we'll<00:02:08.129> bring<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.399> over

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.190 

we<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.040> more<00:02:13.070> gasket<00:02:13.730> left<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:15.020> is

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
we do have one more gasket left it is

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.690 
we do have one more gasket left it is
this<00:02:15.290> gasket<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:15.920> here<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.250> gasket

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
this gasket right here it's a gasket

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.590 
this gasket right here it's a gasket
o-ring<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.060> fits<00:02:17.300> right<00:02:17.450> into<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:18.050> now

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
o-ring it fits right into here now

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.550 
o-ring it fits right into here now
you<00:02:20.600> want<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.870> look<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.080> make<00:02:21.230> sure<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.470> got

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
you want to look and make sure you got

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.210 
you want to look and make sure you got
the<00:02:21.620> old<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.040> off<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> engine<00:02:24.220> because

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
the old one off of the engine because

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.370 
the old one off of the engine because
guess<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.570> did<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:26.960> still<00:02:27.170> down<00:02:27.350> in

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
guess what we did and it's still down in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.710 
guess what we did and it's still down in
there<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:27.950> obviously<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.940> won't<00:02:29.060> go<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.300> if

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
there so obviously it won't go on if

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.460 
there so obviously it won't go on if
it's<00:02:29.870> still<00:02:30.110> there<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:33.080> want<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:33.350> ahead

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's still there so you want to go ahead

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.720 
it's still there so you want to go ahead
and<00:02:33.560> get<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.800> out<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.040> there

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.300 

make<00:02:37.730> sure<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.560> housing<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.680> nice<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.040> clean

again<00:03:30.200> these<00:03:31.190> bolts<00:03:31.580> ended<00:03:31.820> up<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.120> being<00:03:32.360> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
again these bolts ended up all being the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020 
again these bolts ended up all being the
same<00:03:32.690> size<00:03:32.989> but<00:03:33.470> take<00:03:34.070> note<00:03:34.340> as<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.730> where<00:03:34.910> they

same size but take note as to where they

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.150 
same size but take note as to where they
came<00:03:35.239> out<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.810> take<00:03:36.260> note<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.860> where<00:03:37.010> they

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
go in every once in a while you'll come

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.160 
go in every once in a while you'll come
across<00:03:40.209> three<00:03:41.209> or<00:03:41.330> four<00:03:41.480> bolts<00:03:41.840> holding<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
across three or four bolts holding the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.590 
across three or four bolts holding the
same<00:03:42.380> part<00:03:42.709> on<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.160> again<00:03:43.970> one<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.330> bolts

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
same part on and again one of the bolts

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.930 
same part on and again one of the bolts
is<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.750> different<00:03:45.080> size

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.520 

okay<00:03:53.510> well<00:03:53.720> go<00:03:53.810> ahead<00:03:53.960> and<00:03:54.050> snug<00:03:54.260> these<00:03:54.470> down

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
okay well go ahead and snug these down

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.770 
okay well go ahead and snug these down
now<00:03:55.150> basically<00:03:56.150> all<00:03:56.270> we<00:03:56.330> got<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.570> do<00:03:56.660> is

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
now basically all we got to do is

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.050 
now basically all we got to do is
reattach<00:03:57.050> everything<00:03:57.770> got<00:03:58.610> our<00:03:58.730> coolant

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
reattach everything got our coolant

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.510 
reattach everything got our coolant
temperature<00:03:59.510> sensor<00:03:59.980> plug<00:04:00.980> we<00:04:01.100> need<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.340> plug

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
temperature sensor plug we need to plug

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.650 
temperature sensor plug we need to plug
back<00:04:01.760> in<00:04:03.880> snap<00:04:04.880> sure<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.210> in<00:04:05.300> till<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.510> hear

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
back in snap sure it in till you hear

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:14.290 
back in snap sure it in till you hear
the<00:04:05.780> snap<00:04:06.020> put<00:04:06.710> your<00:04:06.830> hoses<00:04:07.040> back<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:13.270> put<00:04:14.270> your

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
the snap put your hoses back on put your

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.699 
the snap put your hoses back on put your
wires<00:04:14.630> into<00:04:15.230> place<00:04:17.230> again<00:04:18.230> these<00:04:18.530> little

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
wires into place again these little

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.390 
wires into place again these little
Christmas<00:04:19.190> trees<00:04:19.459> have<00:04:19.670> little<00:04:21.190> just<00:04:22.190> little

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
Christmas trees have little just little

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.110 
Christmas trees have little just little
push<00:04:22.640> they<00:04:22.880> push<00:04:22.910> right<00:04:23.270> into<00:04:23.510> place<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.970> you

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
push they push right into place if you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.350 
push they push right into place if you
can<00:04:26.150> find<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.630> hole<00:04:28.780> there<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.990> is

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.059 

again<00:04:35.990> we<00:04:36.139> got<00:04:36.259> to<00:04:36.349> attach<00:04:36.560> our<00:04:36.740> upper

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
again we got to attach our upper

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.279 
again we got to attach our upper
radiator<00:04:37.250> hose<00:04:40.659> now<00:04:41.659> there's<00:04:41.960> going<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.199> be

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
radiator hose now there's going to be

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.920 
radiator hose now there's going to be
obviously<00:04:43.069> some<00:04:43.310> air<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.729> here<00:04:43.969> some<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.780> the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
obviously some air in here some of the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.809 
obviously some air in here some of the
systems<00:04:45.439> have<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.800> bleeder<00:04:46.159> screw<00:04:46.280> right<00:04:46.699> on

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
systems have a bleeder screw right on

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.409 
systems have a bleeder screw right on
the<00:04:46.909> top

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
the top

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.540

this<00:04:47.810> particular<00:04:48.259> sealed<00:04:48.560> system<00:04:49.099> is<00:04:49.280> done

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
this particular sealed system is done

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.670 
this particular sealed system is done
differently<00:04:49.819> you<00:04:50.479> could<00:04:50.719> actually<00:04:50.900> pull<00:04:51.319> poor

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
differently you could actually pull poor

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.499 
differently you could actually pull poor
coolant<00:04:52.069> of<00:04:52.189> the<00:04:52.310> hose<00:04:52.490> into<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.879> thermostat

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
coolant of the hose into the thermostat

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.629 
coolant of the hose into the thermostat
but<00:04:54.050> there's<00:04:54.259> really<00:04:54.500> not<00:04:54.740> much<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.280> air<00:04:55.430> will

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
but there's really not much the air will

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.100 
but there's really not much the air will
work<00:04:55.819> itself<00:04:56.150> back<00:04:56.389> out<00:04:56.599> of<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:56.810> overflow

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
work itself back out of the overflow

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.879 
work itself back out of the overflow
bottle<00:05:01.750> I'm<00:05:02.750> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.960> fit<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.319> hose<00:05:03.560> right

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
bottle I'm going to fit that hose right

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.700 
bottle I'm going to fit that hose right
back<00:05:04.099> as<00:05:04.280> far<00:05:04.520> down<00:05:04.550> as<00:05:04.729> it<00:05:05.419> went<00:05:05.569> before<00:05:08.710> your

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
back as far down as it went before your

hose camp clamp pliers run your clamp

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.020 
hose camp clamp pliers run your clamp
right<00:05:14.090> back<00:05:14.330> down<00:05:14.569> where<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.900> was<00:05:16.030> that's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
right back down where it was that's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.879 
right back down where it was that's
another<00:05:17.300> thing<00:05:17.509> these<00:05:17.659> original<00:05:18.289> clamps<00:05:18.770> are

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
another thing these original clamps are

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.670 
another thing these original clamps are
all<00:05:19.009> spring<00:05:19.490> type<00:05:19.819> clamps<00:05:20.389> they<00:05:21.050> do<00:05:21.110> last<00:05:21.530> a

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
all spring type clamps they do last a

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.100 
all spring type clamps they do last a
while<00:05:21.860> but<00:05:22.219> they<00:05:22.340> do<00:05:22.400> wear<00:05:22.759> out<00:05:22.789> too<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.599> if

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
while but they do wear out too so if

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.930 
while but they do wear out too so if
you're<00:05:24.319> replacing<00:05:24.830> hoses<00:05:25.280> or<00:05:25.490> when<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.789> go<00:05:25.909> to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
you're replacing hoses or when you go to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.879 
you're replacing hoses or when you go to
replace<00:05:26.270> hoses<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:27.349> may<00:05:27.500> want<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.710> go<00:05:27.860> with

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
replace hoses you may want to go with

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.969 
replace hoses you may want to go with
replacing<00:05:28.639> these<00:05:28.759> clamps<00:05:29.629> because<00:05:30.440> they<00:05:30.770> all

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
replacing these clamps because they all

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.779 
replacing these clamps because they all
wear<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.669> they<00:05:31.849> all<00:05:32.000> suffer<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.080> same<00:05:33.789> time

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
wear and they all suffer the same time

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.409 
wear and they all suffer the same time
and<00:05:35.120> wear<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.479> tear<00:05:36.819> okay<00:05:37.819> you<00:05:38.029> want<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.330> be

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
and wear and tear okay you want it to be

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.029 
and wear and tear okay you want it to be
all<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.569> way<00:05:38.840> down<00:05:39.050> so<00:05:39.289> it<00:05:39.379> doesn't<00:05:39.409> pop<00:05:39.800> off

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
all the way down so it doesn't pop off

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.050 
all the way down so it doesn't pop off
when<00:05:40.279> it's<00:05:40.400> under<00:05:40.639> pressure

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
when it's under pressure

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.240 
when it's under pressure
make<00:05:41.810> sure<00:05:42.020> everything's<00:05:42.440> correct<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.159> its

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
make sure everything's correct and its

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.159 
make sure everything's correct and its
position<00:05:43.460> nothing<00:05:43.940> should<00:05:44.210> be<00:05:44.270> twisted<00:05:44.840> or<00:05:45.020> in

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
position nothing should be twisted or in

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.040 
position nothing should be twisted or in
the<00:05:45.259> way<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:47.000> spark<00:05:47.360> plug<00:05:47.539> wires<00:05:47.750> should

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
the way the the spark plug wires should

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.249 
the way the the spark plug wires should
be<00:05:48.169> right<00:05:48.529> where<00:05:48.560> they<00:05:48.770> were<00:05:48.889> before

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
be right where they were before

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.260 
be right where they were before
basically<00:05:51.259> all<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.949> got<00:05:52.069> to<00:05:52.159> do<00:05:52.250> now<00:05:52.430> is<00:05:52.729> fill

temperature<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:56.349> check<00:05:57.349> make<00:05:57.560> sure<00:05:57.589> it's<00:05:57.860> not

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
temperature and check make sure it's not

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.850 
temperature and check make sure it's not
overheating<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:59.169> you've<00:06:00.169> done<00:06:00.409> this<00:06:00.589> job

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860

there's no way to check the radiator or

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.059 
there's no way to check the radiator or
add<00:06:04.879> coolant<00:06:05.599> to<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.900> radiator<00:06:06.259> so<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:06.979> is

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
add coolant to the radiator so it is

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.930 
add coolant to the radiator so it is
done<00:06:07.339> by<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.580> radiator<00:06:08.000> overflow<00:06:08.389> bottle
