00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and talk about some of the things I did

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.839 
and talk about some of the things I did
wrong<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.859> quite<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> few<00:00:29.160> mistakes<00:00:29.460> in

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
wrong there's quite a few mistakes in

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
wrong there's quite a few mistakes in
this<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.179> they're<00:00:30.330> pretty<00:00:30.510> obvious<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.099> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
this one they're pretty obvious but it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
this one they're pretty obvious but it
seems<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> interesting<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
seems kind of interesting because it's a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
seems kind of interesting because it's a
pretty<00:00:33.600> good<00:00:33.780> lap<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.920> anyway

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
pretty good lap time here so anyway

00:00:35.340 --> 00:01:41.250 
pretty good lap time here so anyway
check<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> out

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.330 

so<00:01:42.260> obviously<00:01:42.770> there's<00:01:43.040> quite<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> few

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
so obviously there's quite a few

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.680 
so obviously there's quite a few
mistakes<00:01:43.640> there<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.240> ended<00:01:44.450> up<00:01:44.510> pulling

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
mistakes there but I ended up pulling

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.560 
mistakes there but I ended up pulling
off<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.930> 103<00:01:45.710> point<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.400> something<00:01:46.850> can't<00:01:47.360> quite

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
off a 103 point to something can't quite

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.900 
off a 103 point to something can't quite
see<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.810> here<00:01:48.110> but<00:01:48.350> yeah<00:01:49.310> let's<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.580> how<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.700> did

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
see it here but yeah let's see how I did

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.090 
see it here but yeah let's see how I did
it<00:01:50.030> first<00:01:50.330> first<00:01:50.630> corner<00:01:51.020> full<00:01:51.440> throttle<00:01:51.740> not

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
it first first corner full throttle not

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.250 
it first first corner full throttle not
a<00:01:52.130> problem<00:01:52.700> hook<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.240> nice<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.110> inside

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
a problem hook it nice and on the inside

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.740 
a problem hook it nice and on the inside
right<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:55.090> double<00:01:56.090> come<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> little<00:01:56.600> bit

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
right there double come a little bit

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.390 
right there double come a little bit
short<00:01:56.990> here<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.410> is<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> big<00:01:57.860> mistake<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
short here and this is a big mistake I

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.160 
short here and this is a big mistake I
usually<00:01:58.670> hook<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.750> brother<00:01:59.990> right

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
usually hook that that brother right

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.720 
usually hook that that brother right
there<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.470> middle<00:02:00.650> but<00:02:00.980> back<00:02:01.310> end<00:02:01.520> came

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
there in the middle but back end came

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.340 
there in the middle but back end came
out<00:02:01.910> actually<00:02:02.300> makes<00:02:02.600> me<00:02:02.630> come<00:02:02.870> short<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
out actually makes me come short on that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.580 
out actually makes me come short on that
table<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.460> commit<00:02:04.820> just<00:02:05.000> keep<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.360> pinned

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
table but I commit just keep it pinned

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.810 
table but I commit just keep it pinned
actually<00:02:06.590> at<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.710> outside<00:02:07.160> line<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:07.790> I

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
actually at the outside line there I

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.850 
actually at the outside line there I
usually<00:02:08.300> go<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.450> little<00:02:08.630> bit<00:02:08.810> farther<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.260> over

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
usually go a little bit farther in over

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.620 
usually go a little bit farther in over
jump<00:02:10.100> but<00:02:10.550> end<00:02:10.730> up<00:02:10.820> kind<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.060> hipping<00:02:11.480> it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
jump but end up kind of hipping it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.900 
jump but end up kind of hipping it
really<00:02:11.960> same<00:02:12.590> thing<00:02:12.800> here<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> nice<00:02:13.310> hip<00:02:13.670> into

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
really same thing here a nice hip into

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.930 
really same thing here a nice hip into
the<00:02:14.030> corner<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:15.130> liked<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.310> line<00:02:16.550> gives<00:02:16.850> you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the corner I liked that line gives you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.460 
the corner I liked that line gives you
enough<00:02:17.270> speed<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.570> clear<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.020> nice<00:02:18.290> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
enough speed to clear this nice and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.890 
enough speed to clear this nice and
smoothly<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:19.100> could<00:02:19.820> cut<00:02:20.000> way<00:02:20.180> farther<00:02:20.480> inside

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
smoothly I could cut way farther inside

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.570 
smoothly I could cut way farther inside
right<00:02:21.140> there<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.710> pin<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.250> make<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
right there but I pin it and make it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.950 
right there but I pin it and make it
work<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.180> see<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.360> actually<00:02:23.570> carried

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
work you can see I actually carried

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.880 
work you can see I actually carried
quite<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.380> bit<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.740> speed<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.100> there<00:02:26.890> nothing

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
quite a bit of speed you there nothing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.590 
quite a bit of speed you there nothing
really<00:02:27.980> bad<00:02:28.250> right<00:02:28.610> here<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.270> try<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> get

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
really bad right here just try to get

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.290 
really bad right here just try to get
this<00:02:29.690> nice<00:02:29.930> double<00:02:30.610> full<00:02:31.610> throttle<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.120> this

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
this nice double full throttle in this

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.050 
this nice double full throttle in this
inside<00:02:34.450> hit<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.800> get<00:02:36.800> enough<00:02:37.070> speed<00:02:37.400> really

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
inside hit this get enough speed really

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.970 
inside hit this get enough speed really
launched<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:38.930> make<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.560> look<00:02:39.710> cool<00:02:39.950> but

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
launched this one make it look cool but

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160 
launched this one make it look cool but
I'll<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.520> flat<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.690> throws<00:02:41.870> me<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.080> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
I'll and flat and it throws me to the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.960 
I'll and flat and it throws me to the
left<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> zigzag<00:02:43.280> around<00:02:43.430> these<00:02:43.760> two

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
left like a zigzag around these two

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.790 
left like a zigzag around these two
pumps<00:02:44.420> which<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.750> definitely<00:02:44.989> not<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.770> to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
pumps which is definitely not the way to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.890 
pumps which is definitely not the way to
do<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.730> make<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.120> work<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:47.630> stay

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
do it but I make it work just stay

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.350 
do it but I make it work just stay
pinned<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.470> committed<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.160> yeah<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.270> we

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
pinned and committed and yeah there we
