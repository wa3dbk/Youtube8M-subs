 from green nursery joy describes us 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 different varieties of these species 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.020
 do not 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.510
 hello in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.449
 to show 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 plants that are also easy to 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.100
 cultivate that are helmets 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.350
 ah 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.530
 if you have gone to the northern areas 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 to the area of ​​the hills always go to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 see that these little plants that accompany the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.600
 landscape are very beautiful we can 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 have at home in a very good place 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.360
 illuminated and apart from contributing these 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 so curious ways to use them in 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 the gardens in inner courtyards in the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.060
 which we can use it to do 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.759
 those dry gardens with mixtures of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.860
 stones that are very nice we can 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.380
 use them also under other 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.200
 presentations like they can be look 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.750
 these cute plastic cubes like 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.290
 to make a colorful corner or in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.500
 more traditional ways 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.820
 in the pots is this kind of 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.370
 ceramic and many other 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.080
 presentations that we are going to go 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.080
 approaching in in other programs 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 these plants have many shapes 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.300
 different if you see these seem 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 they have shadow of flat shapes and they go 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.909
 giving 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.120
 his prolongations of the little plant and 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.340
 they are full of little spines that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.489
 you do not notice that some have thorns 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.700
 of yellowish colors others have 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.040
 spirits of white color if you see 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.920
 here 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 they have another type that they have here white 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.420
 here yellow 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.379
 some are covered with hairs that the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.420
 completely covers the plant and here 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.230
 we have these that appear as beards 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.910
 long and in the middle are the thorns 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.060
 those thorns 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.470
 and they give it a very nice feature 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.080
 to the little plant and we can 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.650
 use it look at these there are many 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.690
 cactus genera and we can combine them 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.990
 in pailas 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.330
 or we can use them individually 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.120
 they have to be in a very place 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.790
 bright so that the plant 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.560
 develop well and so too can 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.290
 enjoy them with the little flowers because 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.810
 all these plants give flowers they have 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.480
 that give the necessary conditions here 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.750
 we have if you see this are already 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.900
 opening the little flowers are tiny and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.940
 when he finishes giving the flower 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.280
 usually gives a fruiting that 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.440
 It is also interesting because it gives as 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.380
 the colored fruits that are conserved 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.510
 during a certain time in the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.510
 plant 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.030
 what conditions we have to consider 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.400
 with this plant they have to be in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.239
 a very bright place with a place 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.989
 sunny and we do not have to exceed them 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.840
 of water because they are plants that by 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.090
 of areas of origin that have 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.069
 generally these plants are watered very 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.709
 little because they retain moisture 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.910
 because they are from areas where practically 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.940
 Nothing rains then, like every so often 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.300
 receive water that have been adapted for 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.150
 to be able to conserve water if you see 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.220
 they no longer have leaflets or the modification 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.449
 of the leaves has been transformed into 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.750
 thorns 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.419
 that helps them that these plants do not 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.910
 transfer too much and do not lose water 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.940
 they are modifications that the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.610
 nature so that they adapt to 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.610
 the area where they are from 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.210
 and 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.210
 we have to use all of these 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.780
 as I said with little irrigation and have 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.060
 to be well draining soils and other 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.580
 particularity is that we 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.010
 generally apart from covering them with 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.620
 these little stones that give a lot 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.130
 colorful has a double function that 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.040
 when we add water, not the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.590
 splashes too much on the little plant and that 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.590
 way we insulate better from moisture 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.430
 they irrigate very little during the 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.700
 winter and in the summer when the plant 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.940
 is more active we arrived but neither 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.060
 much more or less once every 10 or 15 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.800
 days and in winter 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.570
 the months that are the coldest is 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.660
 preferable to have it without water these 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:55.500
 plants do not miss anything they 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.690
 they behave very well and this is why they 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.690
 said they are easily cultivable 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.400
 we are going to show you ways to use 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.880
 these plants are beautiful and consider 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.060
 one more option to brighten the windows 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.520
 some corner of the house some gallery or 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.220
 out there if you want to use it as 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.160
 a dry garden I hope you have them 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.000
 liked this new proposal and good we 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.000
 we see in the next
