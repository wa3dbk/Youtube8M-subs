if<00:03:44.510> not<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.440> can<00:03:45.470> add<00:03:46.010> some<00:03:46.700> more<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.870> slowly

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
if not you can add some more now slowly

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.810 
if not you can add some more now slowly
keep<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.680> adding<00:03:48.980> little<00:03:49.250> amount<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.760> water

keep on adding little amount of water

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.030 
keep on adding little amount of water
and<00:03:50.450> then<00:03:51.170> start<00:03:51.579> forming<00:03:52.579> it<00:03:52.730> down<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.950> need

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
and then start forming it down we need

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:09.000 
and then start forming it down we need
to<00:03:55.100> make<00:03:55.400> our<00:03:55.700> tight<00:03:55.970> dough

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.740 

so<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.370> should<00:04:10.580> be<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.760> consistency<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
so this should be the consistency of the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.979 
so this should be the consistency of the
dough<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.709> hard<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.459> stiff<00:04:13.790> dough<00:04:14.060> but

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
dough this is a hard and stiff dough but

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.719 
dough this is a hard and stiff dough but
at<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> same<00:04:15.440> time<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.040> nice<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.400> smooth

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
at the same time this is nice and smooth

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.479 
at the same time this is nice and smooth
as<00:04:17.239> well<00:04:17.479> so<00:04:18.229> I'm<00:04:18.380> going<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.829> give<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.250> final

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
as well so I'm going to give it a final

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:27.010 
as well so I'm going to give it a final
need<00:04:22.090> add<00:04:23.090> few<00:04:23.510> drops<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:24.050> oil<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.720> it

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
need add few drops of oil so that it

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.930 
need add few drops of oil so that it
doesn't<00:04:27.290> form<00:04:27.530> any<00:04:27.710> skin<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.040> top<00:04:28.400> because<00:04:28.729> we

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
doesn't form any skin on top because we

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.969 
doesn't form any skin on top because we
are<00:04:29.000> going<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.360> cover<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.169> rest<00:04:30.770> it

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
are going to cover this up and rest it

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.330 
are going to cover this up and rest it
for<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:32.180> 5<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.990> 10<00:04:33.169> minutes<00:04:35.949> so<00:04:36.949> I'm<00:04:37.039> going<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
for just 5 to 10 minutes so I'm going to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.790 
for just 5 to 10 minutes so I'm going to
cover<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.729> up<00:04:37.910> and<00:04:38.120> rest<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.690> for<00:04:38.870> about<00:04:39.350> 5<00:04:39.650> to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
cover this up and rest it for about 5 to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.610 
cover this up and rest it for about 5 to
10<00:04:39.979> minutes<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.600> door<00:04:41.810> absorbs<00:04:42.380> all

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
10 minutes so that the door absorbs all

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.740 
10 minutes so that the door absorbs all
the<00:04:42.770> flavors<00:04:43.160> from<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.699> spices<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.570> we

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
the flavors from the spices that we

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.060 
the flavors from the spices that we
added<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.830> rest<00:04:46.160> time<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.400> done<00:04:47.710> I'm<00:04:48.710> going

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
added so the rest time is done I'm going

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.500 
added so the rest time is done I'm going
to<00:04:49.190> divide<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.820> into<00:04:50.150> two<00:04:50.810> equal<00:04:51.500> portions

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.409 

and<00:04:56.510> I'm<00:04:56.630> going<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.930> shape<00:04:57.199> it<00:04:57.440> into<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.610> circle

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.629 

and<00:05:02.419> do<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.660> same<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.199> another<00:05:03.490> dumpling<00:05:04.490> as

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
and do the same with another dumpling as

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.670 
and do the same with another dumpling as
well<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:06.940> my<00:05:07.940> oil<00:05:07.970> for<00:05:08.720> deep-frying<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:09.349> going

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
well and my oil for deep-frying is going

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.350 
well and my oil for deep-frying is going
on<00:05:09.830> medium<00:05:10.190> already<00:05:12.580> after<00:05:13.580> smoothing<00:05:14.000> this

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
on medium already after smoothing this

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.690 
on medium already after smoothing this
I'm<00:05:17.360> going<00:05:17.599> to<00:05:17.720> start<00:05:17.990> rolling<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.830> into<00:05:19.580> a

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
I'm going to start rolling it into a

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.120 
I'm going to start rolling it into a
roti<00:05:20.560> just<00:05:21.560> grease<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:23.240> counter<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:24.130> little

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.790 
bit of oil few drops and then start
rolling<00:05:29.599> it

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:55.920 

we<00:05:41.340> need<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.610> roll<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:42.140> thin

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:05.680 

hold<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.080> as<00:05:57.470> thin<00:05:57.890> as<00:05:58.010> possible<00:06:04.690> after

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
hold it as thin as possible after

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.290 
hold it as thin as possible after
rolling<00:06:06.020> into<00:06:06.200> a<00:06:06.350> very<00:06:06.710> thin<00:06:06.950> roti<00:06:07.400> like<00:06:08.060> so

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
rolling into a very thin roti like so

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.620 
rolling into a very thin roti like so
I'm<00:06:08.900> going<00:06:09.260> to<00:06:09.290> prick<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.980> dhoti<00:06:10.790> Hollow<00:06:11.300> both

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
I'm going to prick the dhoti Hollow both

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.680 
I'm going to prick the dhoti Hollow both
using<00:06:12.170> a<00:06:12.260> form<00:06:12.590> so<00:06:13.580> that<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.790> doesn't<00:06:14.270> puff<00:06:14.480> up

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
using a form so that it doesn't puff up

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.610 
using a form so that it doesn't puff up
