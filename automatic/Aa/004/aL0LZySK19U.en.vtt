00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 f 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.749
 Hello in this way I would like to introduce you to a program with which you 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.929
 remote control of any other Windows computer can use such programs 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.239
 in the past have already repeatedly presented from the package II 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:27.229
 One of them was Reil VMC Riahi VNC is based on 4 19 and that too here 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:31.179
 featured large logo is actually a VNC client and server 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.539
 but so cleverly packaged so making a connection like that 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.129
 is simpler and that is exactly the objective Cosmo is a software 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.170
 with which you can help other people on the Internet just to the fast 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.290
 assuming they have a problem 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 they have the solution, the biggest problem is going to happen at all 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.600
 Computer to access the other 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.990
 and that makes cost sharing especially easy for us i show puts them 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.820
 on the basis of two XP PCs but of course that works just as well 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 under Wiestler and Windows 7 and just between the respective daughters 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.160
 so 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.870
 from XP to 7 or until 7 and so on 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.310
 In this way it will cost and still install and on the two places 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 is cost and already installed 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.719
 there is already started and it starts with this interface what Melanie 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.230
 you will see her soon 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.530
 instead of more so first on the computer on which it still need to install 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.220
 our standard browser 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.750
 Send me to our city by tractor and the questioning will follow 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.960
 free 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 we should find big ones coming 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.150
 Bought 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 with the possibility to burn free download 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.360
 then he got another download Bartender Kicker on it then 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 we offered the store all the way from the bet 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 with the rest of the world 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.830
 we accept the agreements 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 important is the desktop icon 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.469
 Roßwog start 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.329
 and also here because the easy interface with the two tabs tabs access and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.999
 Access and there are access by default 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.689
 started that's just easier 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.480
 because in our scenario, we assume that you are the one we do 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.909
 to help you have less idea of ​​the whole matter 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.329
 important information for those who have the corresponding so the green 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 Calculator should first be the calculator Heerstraße takes knowledge and on 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.399
 the 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.679
 wants to access blue bill here 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.029
 In that regard, the winner computer must have this access code 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.289
 there is Plauen Rechners 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.159
 and the winner in the case not directly on the appropriate calculator 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.469
 can look 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.750
 it is therefore relatively important for you as a helping one to help them 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.129
 know that from the beginning 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.399
 shortly after the start 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.739
 those whom they should help with this corresponding access code already 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.509
 Seeger as they do not need to say so click on access 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:08.569
 Men by accident 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.919
 is allowed on access and so on 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.109
 So we need appropriate code 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.079
 For so much sugar copies, take over the rest of the phone 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.029
 Of course, the other computer wants to access the hangover tab 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:21.710
 click 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.639
 and then enter the corresponding code here 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.299
 Member of course at the moment either via Voice over IP or even 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.289
 normal phone 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.469
 or via e-mail informed why 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.749
 where was always exchanged he can here the client 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.219
 looks like the blue calculator 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.009
 a sale of diapers click 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.339
 Now the connection is established and now Wörth waited for two minutes 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.549
 if someone Connected to this computer and if not 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.280
 If so, the connection will be disabled again for security reasons 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.180
 Shut up nose we connect it pulls too 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 in a nutshell 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.109
 takes a moment and on the opposite side 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.989
 is now being asked again here is someone who can access their computer 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.819
 they want and want to allow this or they do not want to allow it 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.230
 to make her dirty checkbox 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.549
 For example, we can indicate that the other one is watching us 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.329
 would like to 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.069
 only allowed to observe 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.329
 that they themselves 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.329
 do not perform any actions reported that so they confirm with yes 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.559
 Schalke again 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.559
 here waiting for the approval that today she is a moment 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.729
 Make sure that ads launch program 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.180
 and we get a scaled view of the other PC delivered 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.539
 which we can access now as normal as we now our own 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.479
 Calculator would be just the door to the gate 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.149
 States and the corresponding instructions for example when writing 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.249
 to help the other one should end up with some configuration options 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.290
 the sensual and an interface so i can use the other's keyboard 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.879
 the moment where I am now the blue PCB 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.360
 just 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.310
 the other one does not access i can use the keyboard and the mouse of course 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.129
 at any time in case something happens 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.110
 which I'm not really fond of now 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.530
 as well I can turn over the complete story that means I habs Schaub AG 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.270
 although the connection already stands 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.759
 and of course we can also see files of course he will see ten again 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.610
 meaningful 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.490
 again this time here to do it again 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.520
 and so on 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.050
 here we have the corresponding interface again for the EM ones 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.809
 who access the other computer 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:48.869
 Just open the file while taking this file 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.800
 one is deep 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.539
 However, she quickly succeeded in asking again on the blue calculator 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.020
 because the file Calc, of course, a virus 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.319
 Included in this case, though, are sure and the whole thing 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.210
 save 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.270
 clearly that the party is now relatively small since that's right of course 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.780
 fast 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.069
 at larger currently over normal 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.509
 Network can be a bit longer but everything is quite 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.509
 possible everything super easy 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.909
 So as I said the focus of the program is the possibility 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.619
 Without much effort, helping another person is the big problem 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:24.529
 often 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.139
 the eventual configure a firewall that yes now the person 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.329
 we have to help out and how did I have to do that? 

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:35.430
 Do not do everything not only because the two computers with the not the only one 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:36.779
 have done times 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.100
 give Lam set but that makes cross praise 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.150
 always yourself 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.919
 So it's strictly speaking so the software in little trick and 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.699
 trick it with our firewall but that's what you have to the other video so 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.150
 Super easy in the future
