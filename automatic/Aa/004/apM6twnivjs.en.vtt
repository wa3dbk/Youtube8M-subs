figure<00:02:10.390> before<00:02:10.539> well<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.980> is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
figure before well know that that is

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.070 
figure before well know that that is
basically<00:02:12.819> what<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.269> foot<00:02:13.450> looks<00:02:13.629> like<00:02:13.840> with

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
basically what the foot looks like with

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.350 
basically what the foot looks like with
their<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.530> peg<00:02:14.860> there<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:16.000> either<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
their that peg there for either the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.380 
their that peg there for either the
right<00:02:16.599> or<00:02:16.660> left<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.220> think<00:02:19.000> they've<00:02:19.120> put

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
right or left but I think they've put

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.009 
right or left but I think they've put
the<00:02:19.540> pegs<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:20.019> bit<00:02:20.230> too<00:02:20.440> far<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.980> each<00:02:21.280> side<00:02:22.019> so

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
the pegs a bit too far to each side so

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.070 
the pegs a bit too far to each side so
when<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.470> line<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.190> up<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.940> not<00:02:25.209> perfectly

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
when you line it up it's not perfectly

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.130 
when you line it up it's not perfectly
in<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> center<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.890> them<00:02:27.160> which<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.660> not<00:02:28.870> too

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
in the center of them which I'm not too

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.350 
in the center of them which I'm not too
happy<00:02:29.319> about<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.950> prefer<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.430> if<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.819> if<00:02:31.090> that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
happy about I prefer it if the if that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.710 
happy about I prefer it if the if that
whole<00:02:31.810> point<00:02:32.290> was<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> middle<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
whole point was in the middle of that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.350 
whole point was in the middle of that
that<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.349> between<00:02:35.830> his<00:02:35.950> leg<00:02:36.250> line<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.819> where

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
that in between his leg line there where

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.479 
that in between his leg line there where
his<00:02:37.510> legs<00:02:37.780> would<00:02:38.019> separate<00:02:38.470> if<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:39.040> bit<00:02:39.280> was

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
his legs would separate if that bit was

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.160 
his legs would separate if that bit was
in<00:02:39.700> between<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.870> would<00:02:40.959> make

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
in between that I think that would make

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.130 
in between that I think that would make
it<00:02:41.349> look<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.680> nicer<00:02:42.720> kind<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.840> give<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
it look a lot nicer kind of give it a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.030 
it look a lot nicer kind of give it a
bit<00:02:44.410> more<00:02:44.700> symmetry<00:02:45.700> maybe<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
bit more symmetry maybe I don't know but

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.940 
bit more symmetry maybe I don't know but
yeah<00:02:48.220> he's<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> very<00:02:48.760> good<00:02:48.970> figure

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
yeah he's a very good figure

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.559 
yeah he's a very good figure

on<00:03:11.889> an<00:03:12.190> auction<00:03:12.639> I<00:03:12.790> managed<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.120> get<00:03:13.389> in<00:03:13.569> just

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
on an auction I managed to get in just

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.559 
on an auction I managed to get in just
in<00:03:14.230> time<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.530> steal<00:03:15.040> off<00:03:15.220> someone<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.540> I

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
in time and steal off someone so I

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.150 
in time and steal off someone so I
thought<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.139> got<00:03:17.350> quite<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.620> good<00:03:17.799> deal<00:03:18.010> because

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
thought I got quite a good deal because

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.920 
thought I got quite a good deal because
then<00:03:19.260> for<00:03:20.260> most<00:03:20.799> combiners<00:03:21.760> they'll<00:03:22.060> go<00:03:22.269> for<00:03:22.600> I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
then for most combiners they'll go for I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.710 
then for most combiners they'll go for I
know<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.639> look<00:03:24.819> on<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.299> American

know if you look on some of the American

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.410 
know if you look on some of the American
sites<00:03:25.959> you'll<00:03:26.139> see<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.530> complete<00:03:27.370> ones<00:03:27.639> just

some work on the house I lost load of
