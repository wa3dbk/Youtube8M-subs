easy to get this patch because you only
need<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.000> 3<00:01:33.360> kills<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.900> three<00:01:34.229> score

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
need to get 3 kills or three score

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
need to get 3 kills or three score
points<00:01:34.770> depending<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> mode<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.700> you're

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
points depending on the mode that you're

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210

playing<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.540> within<00:01:37.170> 20<00:01:37.590> seconds<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
playing all within 20 seconds and you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
playing all within 20 seconds and you
won't<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> worry<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.850> dying<00:01:39.210> because

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
won't have to worry about dying because

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
won't have to worry about dying because
it's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> support<00:01:40.259> killstreaks<00:01:40.470> Oh<00:01:40.860> dying
