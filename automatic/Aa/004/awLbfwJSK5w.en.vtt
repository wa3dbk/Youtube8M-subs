00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 the 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.439
 the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.199
 I think it was 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.929
 13 Foxer not more than ten years 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.479
 this this is a true but 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.840
 be using a dictionary too 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 the book come alive 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 next 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.900
 3 started with the year 2010 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.100
 we place 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 jazz 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.830
 was with venice 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.960
 play today 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.010
 actually listen back albayrak 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 her music has always been there 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 I think so 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 let them know 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 what is these videos of hip hop 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.920
 10 in dale the spectrum say it was the speed through jumbo 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 that is soon next to this role 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 watch the first video and there mine 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.530
 dr 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.540
 so that they are on and you can of course no ass at all but it occurs 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.830
 that you then the offer 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.900
 but for me was much more 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.280
 life 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 technically very much will be what I do with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.460
 I have the bed with music 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.120
 just unlucky that will 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.810
 certainly want to do well but that I was not skating much more the earlier then 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.850
 it from the street and goes down 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 so the music and those who sleep with people over the internet do not mean that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.110
 book to show who runs each 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.370
 the supporters 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.420
 late with his book, but it was a record really not too long then 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.579
 the tree is driven 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.589
 and you should try not to put the club in as a bomb could 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.790
 the content is that you watch where we get anywhere through students 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:23.009
 special look like geert man, however, almost all got inspiration 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.529
 from 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.529
 actually I could postpone it 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.089
 I'm fine MTV here 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.669
 Friday night was apparently not after 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.259
 software ensures that it fails 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.719
 young people suggested that he was the first goal after ten years 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.550
 there was one of the best 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.299
 something like that I confess that it sounds 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.540
 khn 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.590
 things i don't want is it not for the remote 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.909
 apparently on stage as well as outside I was completely 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.569
 There was total Poortvliet Lalalalala inspiration, great Halman 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.909
 now i actually make i hope this kind of thing i don't know how much 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.319
 places that's it 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.879
 you get back to finished 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.249
 but it's not around respect 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.849
 heart 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.470
 anyway just take the scratch all day and night 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.049
 with 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.049
 this is the second place we already had at home and 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:33.790
 I had nothing but me that I did not forget for players to walk around me 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.289
 became Tuesday was already the first half year 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:43.350
 the that means that at that time I had it then it was good then 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.979
 the goal and an assist 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.019
 then it started to work, which is strange that it is a bit equal 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.269
 And the worst SBM knows is that it is natural to grow 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.189
 Find this for the line new series he is not the one 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.149
 technology and 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.639
 just as much should you be ready for it, I am only now starting to hang my there 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.829
 they together so that is 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.019
 So you really know what that is about 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.219
 but that doesn't help 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.219
 I'm really on their way there, but that was new 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.009
 the etf make their own fireplace the tilster 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.340
 years later, it was a Sunday sandwich 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.439
 dirk days 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.809
 the sickness 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.809
 and I came across someone 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.500
 4 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.800
 the and to cross at a given time 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 and then it was 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.240
 actually everything ran quickly along with years was really discovered in the first 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.509
 year was just what happens here 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.629
 after the line 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.559
 oh yeah 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.559
 bombay china the booemoem cock fur i was on many points 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.120
 much more out of doors than 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.350
 really the cjib on the spokesman after the first may i think i had one 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.990
 goal then I immediately thought at this school 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.830
 life no longer exists this is the day 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.110
 that was immediately clear 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.930
 especially too 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.199
 I always say that you can 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.430
 no you have been a site if I didn't have the business world 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.839

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:28.359
 kicking off too many resins you are just totally in your own world and you 

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:30.120

 world top places you can do that athens 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.400
 hans 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.939
 the 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:44.740

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.259
 and she has done the studio says and has obtained training 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.930
 I can always be late because I was already offering them to build and own audience 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.349
 again with a profit 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.389
 with the school 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.039
 the first phone call 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.139

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.550
 canada but could welcome new planes that evening
