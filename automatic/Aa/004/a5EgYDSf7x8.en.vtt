those buttons would control mode air you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.450 
those buttons would control mode air you
know<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:25.830> those<00:00:25.980> things<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.369> you

know they do all those things that you
used<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> seen<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.109> cool

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
used to seen it but this is really cool

the central knob controls basically the
whole<00:00:31.650> shooting<00:00:31.859> match<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.279> push<00:00:32.610> auto<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.180> turn

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
whole shooting match I push auto to turn

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
whole shooting match I push auto to turn
it<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.410> look<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> boxes<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it on and then look at the boxes here so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
it on and then look at the boxes here so
I<00:00:35.640> grab<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> move<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> left<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> from

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I grab this and move it left and from

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.830 
I grab this and move it left and from
there<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.340> change<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> mode<00:00:39.120> by<00:00:39.270> twisting

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
there I can change the mode by twisting

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
there I can change the mode by twisting
you<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.230> changing<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.680> vents<00:00:41.149> move<00:00:42.149> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you see I'm changing the vents move it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
you see I'm changing the vents move it
back<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> adjust

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
back to the right and then I can adjust

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
back to the right and then I can adjust
the<00:00:44.010> fan<00:00:44.219> speed<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> they've<00:00:46.079> really

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the fan speed so they've really

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
the fan speed so they've really
simplified<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
if we run it auto what controls

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
if we run it auto what controls

everything else but they really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
everything else but they really
simplified<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.300> time<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.690> outside

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
