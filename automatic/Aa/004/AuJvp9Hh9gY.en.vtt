00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello to all of you this is the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.849
 regeneration so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.790
 excuse me for the pronunciation but 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 I do not know too much about this boarding school 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.150
 today I make you a little 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 article about the wolf yeah I have 7210 or 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 also called panama by orange 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 so I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 presentation on this phone that is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.019
 simple but at the same time that has 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.670
 nice options 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.950
 I will start first with 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.100
 disadvantages of this phone the first 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.660
 big disadvantage on a touch is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 already not being able to lock it where 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 we want what makes me actually 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 can lock it only on the page 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 welcome kind if dropped in the menu I 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.540
 can not locked if I do I 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.040
 do all close together to turn yes eh 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.740
 Well it gives me on the beach the teloche 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.620
 pol bury that on the home page that 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.400
 it is very very disadvantageous especially 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.610
 on a touch so appreciated this is it 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.110
 so there I show you is quickly done 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.690
 the controller more indebted everything to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.000
 time excuse me for contrast a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.430
 little rotten this little keyboard here that 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.320
 rament for those who are not 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.770
 accustomed to using this sertic is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.540
 still pretty small level must we 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 can easily get into the habit that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 me because I had a big dose 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.660
 to have this phone but if we do not like 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.910
 not and we can not make that one write 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.270
 is good believe me you're going to have to 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.479
 mast 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.710
 other than that there is not that it's true 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.710
 that there is no button on the side there 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.759
 frankly nothing was button of 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.610
 volume to the annexed binon that in France is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.729
 can and to the the the button of the apparatus 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.470
 photo is missing gap still separates 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.759
 so the too serious and there is no 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.890
 button to lock it is for the eye 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.460
 of a strong effect more than he is if he 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.470
 was on that side I'm a brief after 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.750
 a synth fans first ready it does not take 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.310
 no longer expect kind 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.300
 at the aesthetic level and all levels 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.990
 galaxy s2 so that's good bah speaking 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.940
 beauty 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.320
 that's coaches I stuck a c 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.720
 to see and at the aesthetic level it is 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.560
 very simple it is very simple but it 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.120
 is not too ugly we will say 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.660
 you can make a little trick 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.340
 design sweat on the black so there we 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.209
 had we got the headphones out 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 classic a usb output like on the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.470
 blackberry or samsung is a 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.290
 classic release that you can 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.690
 certainly possible own it has a 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.250
 little head of a peeled rhone like that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.920
 with the key at best the were high 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.519
 except that there any familiar is not used to 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.660
 a fact back she she gets into the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.890
 middle question so this is a screen 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.900
 of watch that I put that I 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.850
 custom we can put a screen of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.400
 standby waiting for everyone after this 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.959
 little loudspeaker life know they 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.269
 work well it's a phone 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.190
 entry-level so is not of a 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.010
 great quality it's also not a 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.670
 here is a microphone at the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.150
 what are we talking about 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.400
 it's a little thing that works well 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.870
 but rough quality of sound is not 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.750
 not at the top 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.090
 by the way it's speakers there for 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.450
 the music or when to put a call 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.980
 on speaker he works very well 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.269
 but frankly it does not work badly 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.099
 this is by setting apart that 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.450
 could encounter a bug that means 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.940
 that you are listening you are trying 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.680
 to listen to music and suddenly the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.599
 music the baths starts to have more than 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.739
 base either are weird so if it takes 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.360
 to do is just pause and 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.310
 put back play and the center will become 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.760
 as before so I share that it works 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.620
 very very good the 3.2 camera 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.790
 megapixel 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.579
 I also showed you a little tip 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.170
 for the to delegate the video because 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.220
 that actually on this laptop 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 the live video much wear the top 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.269
 speaker sim card that are here the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.769
 SD card if you searched for it goes in 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.349
 below and just below the map 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.019
 sim and the battery and so the device 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.139
 photo so this camera him and 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.150
 well he takes one takes beautiful pictures 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.970
 frankly must confess to the bar kind 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.229
 equivalent in trumpeting the videos 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.970
 it's the same once we've got them 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.400
 delegate ben late we found the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.340
 method for pruning the video she's getting 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.660
 takes very very well too and 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.889
 so here I want to do it right it's 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.449
 leave to present a little 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.520
 the aesthetics of the phone how they 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.590
 work out and I 'm doing a 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.780
 part of the nave to represent the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.070
 this phone's navigation if you 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.630
 want to look at the negation is all about 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.470
 continuation in the part of this service does 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.570
 look at this here is where it takes 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.770
 just have to go to the options 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.080
 it's a stupid thing for the delegate 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.180
 I came across and it takes 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.870
 care that takes in three gp the place of 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.120
 take in mp4 like samsung berrois 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.290
 new limit star player without that it's 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 the same thing is the same quality 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.229
 video 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.639
 the home in fact it's just the quality 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.650
 sion takes a little worse in three 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.110
 gp that's all sense to the quality is 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.830
 not so for that finally 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.620
 if it will ccq 3.2 so these voices its there 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.850
 qualities peron video level its qualities 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.970
 will like a test of three points two 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.669
 not the 5 megapixels or something like that 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.160
 so that's all going I introduced you 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.870
 a little aesthetic level 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.500
 features he has a beautiful all- in-one 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.990
 to the wifi 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.580
 the version of ubuntu will not do it if I 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.919
 believe you quote him because I 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.639
 remember colder also at 2.0 a 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.620
 something like that 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.220
 wifi I have no idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.800
 version that's so yeah he's endowed 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.770
 the wii made a wi fi of a 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.599
 It is not say that it works well 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.379
 but hey she is not super either 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.629
 elevated the wii made a here at 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.159
 disadvantage it's I have another flaw to 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:07.699
 propose on this phone is the 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:11.020
 orange navigation on orange world 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:14.960
 the nation I do not want to say and to have 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.060
 so she is very small like that one 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.569
 can not grow and we can navigate that 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.340
 in this little square it's okay 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.449
 fluid is still okay but the blemish 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.500
 know that you can not enlarge it 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.090
 we can put it like that we can not 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.699
 to emit swept so on this 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.289
 phone is not the development has to 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.419
 do it yourself when there is the touch 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.460
 indicated for next phone but 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.680
 that ended up more 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.550
 various and download mini opera like 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.669
 often does one that is easy 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.810
 access full of different versions - 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.490
 personally the best version 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.330
 opera mini games on phone this is where 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.400
 this is the 4.2 frankly because that 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.659
 according to her is more beautiful level 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.409
 aesthetic and all but al ahram 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:02.449
 so much more so here 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:07.069
 after it's customizable 1 it's 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:09.380
 very nice but that's the game when 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:12.440
 I will stop this part here I will 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.409
 let's look at part 2 for the 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.389
 browsing this phone has already done 7 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.490
 minutes of presentation how they 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.860
 were etc 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.629
 I think it should go if you 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.740
 it may be forgotten defects because 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:26.690
 that I know it is a little good 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.139
 package of fairs tell about this 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.349
 phone 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.910
 if you know about it yourself says 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:36.060
 month by comment 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:39.840
 finally here that's it I stop this 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:42.509
 share is holding here i'm going to show you in 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.060
 now part ii of the nakba where 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:47.669
 I will navigate the phone for 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.289
 show the navigation what is fluid 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:54.259
 or not and that it was finally you will see 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:54.259
 in part ii now thank you goodbye
