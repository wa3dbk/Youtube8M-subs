 the recipe 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.280
 and these are the ingredients that I'm going to 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.240

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.550
 as always a very easy recipe the 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.840
 kilogram of apples will be more or less 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.700
 three or four apples according to their size and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.440
 The first thing to do is to peel 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.440
 two of the apples 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.900
 since half of us are going to use them for 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.690
 cake and the other half to decorate by 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.790

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.290
 cup of flour the egg 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.070
 the milk cup 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.159
 [Music] 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.250
 the cup of sugar if you want you can 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.020
 use white sugar or brown sugar 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.150
 I'm going to mix a little bit with a spoon 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 and then mixer 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.350
 [Music] 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 [Applause] 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.970
 we must make it all 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.370
 ingredients 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.690
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.210
 no apple pieces left 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.650
 [Music] 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.650
 [Applause] 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:05.420
 and now yes here we have the preparation 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.420
 list you have to keep a mold 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.210
 where we will place 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.210
 the cake 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.970
 and above I will decorate 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.080
 with the apple that was cut in 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.630
 blades 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.630
 [Music] 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.700
 with a big apple or two small 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.700
 achieves well to decorate up 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.899
 [Music] 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.360
 you can crush a little bit so that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.140
 is well even and now if you have to 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.300
 Take it to the oven at 180 degrees during 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.300
 about 40 minutes 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.000
 and once we have it ready we are going to 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.230
 paint over with a little 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.330
 Orange marmalade 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.330
 [Music] 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.699
 you have to let it cool 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.699
 [Music] 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.740
 and once it's cold you can 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.740
 disassemble 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.969
 As you can see , the mold comes out very easily 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.190
 to remove the bottom part with the 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.230
 help from a spatula 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.540
 we are going to lift it, we have to put it in 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.300
 a plate and we have the cake ready 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.910

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.350
