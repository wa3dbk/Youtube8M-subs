the count is running the audio is

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.190 
the count is running the audio is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and crops you get a good clean movie

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.550 
and crops you get a good clean movie
pitch<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.570> edge<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:52.689> all<00:01:52.780> right

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
pitch to edge you see it's all right

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
pitch to edge you see it's all right
after<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.830> edges<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.250> really<00:01:54.369> nice<00:01:54.520> to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
after the edges so it's really nice to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.340 
after the edges so it's really nice to
give<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.909> 10<00:01:55.090> alone<00:01:55.179> flanking<00:01:55.689> so<00:01:56.170> when<00:01:56.289> you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
give it a 10 alone flanking so when you

the<00:02:10.030> same<00:02:10.239> size<00:02:10.290> iphone<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.400> course<00:02:12.580> for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
the same size iphone and of course for

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.960 
the same size iphone and of course for
resolution<00:02:14.519> shouldn't<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.670> able<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.880> do

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
resolution shouldn't you be able to do

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.610 
resolution shouldn't you be able to do
one<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.360> code<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.810> will<00:02:16.930> work<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.380> iPod

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
one in code that will work on iPod

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.400 
one in code that will work on iPod
iPhone<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.760> Apple<00:02:18.940> TV<00:02:19.420> yeah<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:20.319> you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
iPhone and Apple TV yeah I think if you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.740 
iPhone and Apple TV yeah I think if you
do<00:02:20.560> well<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.220> ipod<00:02:21.549> small<00:02:21.880> it'll<00:02:22.630> work

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
do well if you do ipod small it'll work

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.449 
do well if you do ipod small it'll work
on<00:02:22.930> every<00:02:23.110> product<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.100> course<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.370> won't

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
on every product but of course you won't

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.860 
on every product but of course you won't
get<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> best<00:02:24.880> resolution<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> bigger

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
get the best resolution on the bigger

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.320 
get the best resolution on the bigger
devices<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:26.530> i<00:02:26.769> think<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.819> larger

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
devices so i think if you do a larger

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.150 
devices so i think if you do a larger
like<00:02:28.959> ipod<00:02:29.260> larger<00:02:29.560> code<00:02:29.769> i<00:02:29.860> think<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.099> won't

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
like ipod larger code i think it won't

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.039 
like ipod larger code i think it won't
work<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.580> original<00:02:30.970> ipods<00:02:31.299> okay<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
work on the original ipods okay but it

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.930 
work on the original ipods okay but it
works<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.319> everything<00:02:32.380> else<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.040> i<00:02:33.280> pod<00:02:33.670> small

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
works and everything else so i pod small

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.430 
works and everything else so i pod small
will<00:02:34.060> work<00:02:34.209> on<00:02:34.360> everything<00:02:34.599> but<00:02:34.810> not<00:02:34.989> full

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
will work on everything but not full

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.199 
will work on everything but not full
resolution<00:02:35.620> exactly<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.579> an<00:02:36.700> iphone's<00:02:37.030> got

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
resolution exactly like an iphone's got

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.819 
resolution exactly like an iphone's got
a<00:02:37.239> high-resolution<00:02:37.900> screens<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
a high-resolution screens and the

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.590 
a high-resolution screens and the
regional<00:02:39.130> ipod<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.420> want<00:02:40.570> to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
regional ipod so you really want to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.940 
regional ipod so you really want to
encode<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.019> larger<00:02:41.350> size<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.769> going<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
encode on a larger size if you going to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.759 
encode on a larger size if you going to
be<00:02:42.010> using<00:02:42.160> products<00:02:42.579> like<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:43.620> $119<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
be using products like that $119 to

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.590 
be using products like that $119 to
scare<00:02:45.010> most<00:02:45.700> files<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.239> can<00:02:46.420> all<00:02:46.480> be

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
scare most files now can all be

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.729 
scare most files now can all be
something<00:02:46.870> straight<00:02:47.019> into<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.230> iphone<00:02:47.590> or

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
something straight into your iphone or

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.130 
something straight into your iphone or
your<00:02:47.769> iPod<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.299> really<00:02:49.480> fun<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.989> easy

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
your iPod so it's a really fun and easy

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.630 
your iPod so it's a really fun and easy
product<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.530> use<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.220> think<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.609> looks

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
product to use and I think it looks

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.060 
product to use and I think it looks
great<00:02:51.850> but<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.930> also<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.530> it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
great but you can also it's it's

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.880 
great but you can also it's it's
basically<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.519> h.264<00:02:55.299> encoder<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.870> our<00:02:56.109> h.264

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
basically in h.264 encoder is our h.264

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.790 
basically in h.264 encoder is our h.264
files<00:02:57.100> if<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.930> open<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.019> up<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.329> there

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
files if I open one up there is there

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.250 
files if I open one up there is there
h.264<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:05.210> it's<00:03:05.390> slightly<00:03:05.690> less<00:03:05.930> than<00:03:05.960> full

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
h.264 and it's slightly less than full

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.790 
h.264 and it's slightly less than full
resolution<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> crop<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> little

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
resolution is the crop a little

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.710 
resolution is the crop a little
now<00:03:09.400> when<00:03:09.550> i<00:03:09.670> first<00:03:09.940> started<00:03:10.030> looking<00:03:10.540> tasty

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
now when i first started looking tasty

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.650 
now when i first started looking tasty
up<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.140> 64<00:03:11.620> i<00:03:11.860> was<00:03:12.040> spending<00:03:12.660> unimaginable

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
up to 64 i was spending unimaginable

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.200 
up to 64 i was spending unimaginable
amounts<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.110> time<00:03:14.260> encoding<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.010> g5<00:03:15.430> which

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
amounts of time encoding on my g5 which

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.970 
amounts of time encoding on my g5 which
is<00:03:16.330> what<00:03:16.450> i<00:03:16.480> was<00:03:16.630> using<00:03:16.780> back<00:03:17.020> then<00:03:17.230> yeah<00:03:17.620> so

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
is what i was using back then yeah so

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.170 
is what i was using back then yeah so
that's<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.340> great<00:03:18.550> thing<00:03:18.580> about<00:03:18.760> video

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
that's the great thing about video

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's the great thing about video
recorder<00:03:19.510> because<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.780> records<00:03:19.990> indicate

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
recorder because it records indicate

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.170 
recorder because it records indicate
statistics<00:03:20.800> for<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.610> don't<00:03:21.760> need<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.970> do<00:03:22.060> any

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
statistics for you don't need to do any

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.690 
statistics for you don't need to do any
rendering<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.020> your<00:03:23.170> IT<00:03:23.320> ipod<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
rendering to get it to your IT ipod and

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.830 
rendering to get it to your IT ipod and
also<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> good<00:03:25.150> thing<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.450> can<00:03:25.540> use<00:03:25.570> much

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
also the good thing is you can use much

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.750 
also the good thing is you can use much
slower<00:03:26.050> computers<00:03:26.560> because<00:03:26.890> all<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.130> work<00:03:27.580> is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
slower computers because all the work is

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.030 
slower computers because all the work is
done<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.480> device<00:03:28.780> itself<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.800> we've<00:03:29.920> had<00:03:29.950> to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
done in a device itself so we've had to

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.580 
done in a device itself so we've had to
work<00:03:30.250> enormously<00:03:30.700> hard<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.000> get<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.150> complete

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
work enormously hard to get a complete

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.380 
work enormously hard to get a complete
h.264<00:03:32.590> encoder<00:03:32.890> product<00:03:33.310> into<00:03:33.940> such<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> small

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
h.264 encoder product into such a small

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.080 
h.264 encoder product into such a small
USB<00:03:34.690> size<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.980> know<00:03:36.070> if<00:03:36.130> we<00:03:36.250> did<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.430> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
USB size but you know if we did that you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.760 
USB size but you know if we did that you
can<00:03:37.210> drop<00:03:37.300> any<00:03:37.480> laptop<00:03:37.900> bag<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.380> can<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.650> it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
can drop any laptop bag you can have it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.770 
can drop any laptop bag you can have it
you<00:03:39.280> know<00:03:39.400> available<00:03:39.910> with<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.360> other<00:03:40.510> you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
you know available with the other you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.420 
you know available with the other you
know<00:03:40.870> with<00:03:40.990> your<00:03:41.080> computer<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:41.680> everything

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
know with your computer so everything

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.590 
know with your computer so everything
can<00:03:42.490> be<00:03:42.550> benefit<00:03:42.910> from<00:03:43.000> being<00:03:43.120> small<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.570> a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
can be benefit from being small on a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.490 
can be benefit from being small on a
