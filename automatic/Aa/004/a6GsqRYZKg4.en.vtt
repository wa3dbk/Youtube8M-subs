I had the HUD hidden there but the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.779 
I had the HUD hidden there but the
minute<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:45.989> menus<00:00:46.520> there<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
minute we go to our menus there it is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580

I<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:51.090> it'll<00:00:51.239> show<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> video<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I think it'll show up on the video it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.319 
I think it'll show up on the video it
may<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.320> hopefully<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.829> does<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.910> anyway<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
may not hopefully it does but anyway you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
may not hopefully it does but anyway you
guys<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.809> probably<00:00:54.899> aware<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.559> whenever

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
guys are probably aware of that whenever

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
guys are probably aware of that whenever
you<00:00:56.309> pick<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.640> item<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.030> mouse<00:00:57.180> cursor

through<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.640> game<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:09.530> into<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.250> know

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
through the game and going into you know

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.330 
through the game and going into you know
level<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:10.790> interfaces<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.720> kind<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.020> stuff

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
level up interfaces that kind of stuff

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.130 
level up interfaces that kind of stuff
we<00:03:13.340> don't<00:03:13.430> have<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.730> deal<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.600> cursor

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
we don't have to deal with the cursor

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
we don't have to deal with the cursor
popping<00:03:15.470> up<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.739> completely<00:03:16.160> destroying<00:03:16.520> any

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
immersion that we had going on in the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.560 
immersion that we had going on in the
game<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.880> as<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.180> see<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.390> not

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
game so as you can see it's not

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.009 
game so as you can see it's not
available<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.080> level<00:03:21.320> up<00:03:21.410> menu<00:03:21.560> anymore

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
available in the level up menu anymore

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.560

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
because it was a major frustration for

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.650 
because it was a major frustration for
me<00:03:57.260> but<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.250> little<00:03:58.370> piece<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:58.730> software<00:03:58.850> did

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
me but this little piece of software did

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.479 
me but this little piece of software did
pretty<00:03:59.840> well<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.650> pretty<00:04:00.829> much<00:04:00.980> completely

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
pretty well it's pretty much completely

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.250 
pretty well it's pretty much completely
resolved<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:01.970> issue<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.840> handy<00:04:02.989> if<00:04:03.170> you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
resolved the issue and it's handy if you

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.720 
resolved the issue and it's handy if you
need<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.470> for<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.590> PowerPoint<00:04:04.070> presentation<00:04:04.100> or

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
need it for a PowerPoint presentation or

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.640 
need it for a PowerPoint presentation or
something<00:04:04.970> else<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.329> that<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.019> pretty<00:04:06.530> good

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
something else like that so pretty good

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.100 
something else like that so pretty good
little<00:04:06.739> piece<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.070> software<00:04:07.870> like<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:08.959> said

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
little piece of software like I said

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.069 
little piece of software like I said
there<00:04:09.230> are<00:04:09.260> other<00:04:09.530> ways<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.709> do<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:11.079> I

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
there are other ways to do this but I I

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.479 
there are other ways to do this but I I
don't<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.590> recommend<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:13.100> unless<00:04:13.250> you're

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
don't really recommend it unless you're

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.289 
don't really recommend it unless you're
getting<00:04:13.760> ready<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.910> model<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.209> start

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
getting ready to model to start

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.850 
getting ready to model to start
modifying<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.870> game<00:04:15.079> files<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.590> things<00:04:15.680> like

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
modifying the game files and things like

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.800 
modifying the game files and things like
that<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> good<00:04:17.180> way<00:04:17.299> if<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:17.540> just<00:04:17.630> want

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
that this is a good way if you just want

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.330 
that this is a good way if you just want
to<00:04:17.989> keep<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.290> immersion<00:04:18.530> factor<00:04:18.979> going<00:04:19.250> on

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
to keep that immersion factor going on

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.440 
to keep that immersion factor going on
and<00:04:19.549> completely<00:04:19.880> get<00:04:20.030> rid<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.329> mouse

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
and completely get rid of the mouse

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.260 
and completely get rid of the mouse
while<00:04:21.320> you're<00:04:21.500> using<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.859> controller<00:04:22.270> this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
while you're using a controller this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.029 
while you're using a controller this
would<00:04:23.450> be<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.630> way<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.780> do<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.110> but<00:04:24.979> that's

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
would be the way to do it but that's

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.680 
would be the way to do it but that's
about<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.370> guys<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
about it guys and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.410 
about it guys and
we<00:04:26.810> will<00:04:26.930> see<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.200> around
