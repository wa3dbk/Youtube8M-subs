hi I'm Karla Schaffer TNT speech

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.190 
hi I'm Karla Schaffer TNT speech
designer<00:00:04.819> and<00:00:05.120> today<00:00:05.450> we're<00:00:05.690> going<00:00:05.960> to<00:00:06.080> go

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
designer and today we're going to go

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.060 
designer and today we're going to go
over<00:00:06.410> how<00:00:06.559> to<00:00:06.590> make<00:00:06.740> an<00:00:07.010> elastic<00:00:07.490> bracelet

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.430 

today<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.700> using<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.440> gemstone

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
today we're going to be using a gemstone

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
today we're going to be using a gemstone
double<00:00:14.160> hold<00:00:14.630> or<00:00:15.630> double-stranded<00:00:16.560> bead<00:00:17.029> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
double hold or double-stranded bead so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.120 
double hold or double-stranded bead so
I'm<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.689> to<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.869> five<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.380> these<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.950> then

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I'm going to use five of these and then

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.700 
I'm going to use five of these and then
I'm<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.640> using<00:00:21.000> an<00:00:21.119> 8<00:00:21.330> millimeter

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
I'm going to be using an 8 millimeter

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.050 
I'm going to be using an 8 millimeter
Swarovski<00:00:22.710> crystal<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.200> also<00:00:25.200> a<00:00:25.230> Bali<00:00:25.590> bead

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
Swarovski crystal and also a Bali bead

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
Swarovski crystal and also a Bali bead
this<00:00:27.060> stringing<00:00:27.900> material<00:00:28.320> we're<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this stringing material we're going to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.350 
this stringing material we're going to
be<00:00:28.680> using<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.040> an<00:00:29.160> elasticity<00:00:29.610> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.239> to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
be using as an elasticity and I want to

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.170 
be using as an elasticity and I want to
use<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.540> point<00:00:30.960> eight<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> because<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
use a point eight so because it's a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.250 
use a point eight so because it's a
little<00:00:33.390> heavier<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.810> little<00:00:33.989> stronger

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little heavier and a little stronger

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.569 
little heavier and a little stronger
because<00:00:34.470> these<00:00:34.649> beads<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.040> tend<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
because these beads are tend to be a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
because these beads are tend to be a
little<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.970> heavy<00:00:36.149> side<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.500> only

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
little on the heavy side and the only

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.710 
little on the heavy side and the only
tool<00:00:37.980> you'll<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.370> needing<00:00:38.640> today<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> pair

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
tool you'll be needing today is a pair

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.060 
tool you'll be needing today is a pair
of<00:00:39.750> nipper<00:00:39.930> tools<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.380> cut<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> elasticity

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of nipper tools to cut the elasticity

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.360 
of nipper tools to cut the elasticity
and<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.570> hypo<00:00:43.320> cement<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.829> glue<00:00:43.859> or<00:00:44.160> knots

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and some hypo cement to glue or knots

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
and some hypo cement to glue or knots
okay<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.329> started<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.500> actually

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
okay to get started I'm not actually

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.009 
okay to get started I'm not actually
going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> cut<00:00:47.429> the<00:00:47.910> elasticity<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
going to cut the elasticity off the

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.240 
going to cut the elasticity off the
roller<00:00:49.199> I'm<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.710> directly<00:00:49.920> off

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
roller I'm going to work directly off

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.099 
roller I'm going to work directly off
the<00:00:50.429> Roll<00:00:50.640> which<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.359> something<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.929> a

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
the Roll which is something that's a

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.419 
the Roll which is something that's a
little<00:00:52.199> easier<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.339> working

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
little easier to do when you're working

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.430 
little easier to do when you're working
with<00:00:53.640> elasticity<00:00:54.179> so<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.170> thing<00:00:55.320> I'm

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
with elasticity so the first thing I'm

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
with elasticity so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.589> do<00:00:55.769> is<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.519> string<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
going to do is I'm going to string on a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
going to do is I'm going to string on a
Bali<00:00:57.960> bead<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.260> then<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.409> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> string

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Bali bead and then I'm going to string

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.250 
Bali bead and then I'm going to string
it<00:01:02.219> through<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.579> top<00:01:02.789> hole<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.100> bead<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
it through the top hole of the bead and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.330 
it through the top hole of the bead and
then<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> put<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.800> another<00:01:07.950> Bali

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
then I'm going to put on another Bali

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.430 
then I'm going to put on another Bali
and<00:01:08.900> a<00:01:09.900> crystal<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:11.480> then<00:01:12.480> another<00:01:12.720> Bali<00:01:13.050> and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
and a crystal and then another Bali and

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.929 
and a crystal and then another Bali and
this<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.800> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.009> be<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.189> pattern<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.790> we

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
this is going to be our pattern that we

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
this is going to be our pattern that we
do<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.740> we're<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
do all the way around and we're going to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
do all the way around and we're going to
do<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:22.040> strands<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.310> holes<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
do the top strands or holes first and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.889 
do the top strands or holes first and
then<00:01:25.170> we'll<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.469> bottom<00:01:26.540> when<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
then we'll do the bottom when we get the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.660 
then we'll do the bottom when we get the
top<00:01:28.079> done<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.590> we'll<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.890> ahead<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.070> knot<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
top done then we'll go ahead and knot it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899 
top done then we'll go ahead and knot it
and<00:01:30.079> then<00:01:31.079> we'll<00:01:31.229> work<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> bottom<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and then we'll work the bottom now that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.289 
and then we'll work the bottom now that
I've<00:01:33.000> completed<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.689> top<00:01:34.579> strand<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.909> hole<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I've completed the top strand or hole on

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
I've completed the top strand or hole on
these<00:01:36.509> beads<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.439> tie<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.649> off<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
these beads I'm going to tie it off and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
these beads I'm going to tie it off and
now<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> am<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.210> ahead<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
now I am actually going to go ahead and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.609 
now I am actually going to go ahead and
snip<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.490> elasticity<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> nipper<00:01:42.090> tool

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
snip the elasticity with the nipper tool

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
snip the elasticity with the nipper tool
and<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> knot<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.689> going

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and I'm going to knot this and I'm going

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.240 
and I'm going to knot this and I'm going
to<00:01:45.869> show<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.469> reason<00:01:46.799> why<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> started

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to show you the reason why I started

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
to show you the reason why I started
with<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> Bali<00:01:47.759> bead<00:01:48.030> was<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.659> hide

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
with the Bali bead was so I could hide

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
with the Bali bead was so I could hide
my<00:01:48.899> knot<00:01:49.439> inside<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.219> valley<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
my knot inside this valley because it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
my knot inside this valley because it
has<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> bigger<00:01:51.570> hole<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.920> we're<00:01:53.039> going<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
has a bigger hole so what we're going to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
has a bigger hole so what we're going to
do<00:01:53.310> first<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> we're<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.509> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
do first is we're just going to do like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.330 
do first is we're just going to do like
you're<00:01:55.289> tying<00:01:55.469> your<00:01:55.590> shoe<00:01:56.659> first<00:01:58.310> until<00:01:59.310> we

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you're tying your shoe first until we

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
you're tying your shoe first until we
get<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> nice<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.180> snug<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.469> we're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
get it nice and snug and then we're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.469 
get it nice and snug and then we're
going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.039> again<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.240> tying

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
going to do it again as if you're tying

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.910 
going to do it again as if you're tying
your<00:02:03.659> shoe<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> cross

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
your shoe but this time when you cross

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
your shoe but this time when you cross
over<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.430> top<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.359> cross<00:02:06.600> over

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
over the top we're going to cross over

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680 
over the top we're going to cross over
it<00:02:07.020> two<00:02:07.289> times<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.149> does<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it two times and what this does is it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.320 
it two times and what this does is it
will<00:02:09.780> make<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.200> stay<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:12.030> easier

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
will make this stay just a little easier

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.990 
will make this stay just a little easier
sometimes<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.900> elasticity<00:02:13.590> tends<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.460> slip<00:02:14.790> out

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
sometimes I elasticity tends to slip out

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720 
sometimes I elasticity tends to slip out
of<00:02:15.180> knots<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.130> double<00:02:17.400> measure<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
of knots and just for double measure I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.760 
of knots and just for double measure I
like<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.240> ahead<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.600> knot<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.590> more

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
like to go ahead and knot it one more

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.330 
like to go ahead and knot it one more
time

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
time

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.540 
time
and<00:02:21.340> again<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:24.060> bring<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.240> over<00:02:25.510> twice

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and again not it bring it over twice

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.699 
and again not it bring it over twice
okay<00:02:27.550> now

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.970 

and<00:02:34.219> see<00:02:34.760> how<00:02:34.939> that<00:02:35.000> knot<00:02:35.870> slides<00:02:36.319> rod<00:02:36.680> into

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
and see how that knot slides rod into

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.649 
and see how that knot slides rod into
that<00:02:37.189> belly<00:02:37.340> bead<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:38.239> what<00:02:38.390> we're<00:02:38.510> going<00:02:38.629> to

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
that belly bead now what we're going to

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:49.220 
that belly bead now what we're going to
do<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.049> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:39.500> some<00:02:39.680> hypo<00:02:40.010> cement

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.740 

we're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> drop<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:50.670> knot<00:02:53.750> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
we're going to drop it on this knot and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
we're going to drop it on this knot and
then<00:02:54.989> I'm<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.470> going<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.920> slide<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.280> knot

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
then I'm just going to slide that knot

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.339 
then I'm just going to slide that knot
inside<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.660> Bali<00:02:57.900> bead<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.290> I'm

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
inside that little Bali bead and I'm

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.839 
inside that little Bali bead and I'm
just<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.739> these<00:02:58.920> tails<00:02:59.190> hang<00:02:59.430> out<00:02:59.580> for

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
just going with these tails hang out for

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.820 
just going with these tails hang out for
just<00:02:59.879> for<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:00.810> now<00:03:00.840> until<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.590> do<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
just for right now until we do the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.940 
just for right now until we do the
bottom<00:03:02.160> strand<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.790> then<00:03:02.970> we'll<00:03:03.150> trim<00:03:03.510> those

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
bottom strand and then we'll trim those

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.610 
bottom strand and then we'll trim those
okay<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> start<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.640> second<00:03:06.480> strand<00:03:06.840> again

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
okay to start the second strand again

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.870 
okay to start the second strand again
all<00:03:07.769> I'm<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.099> do<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.340> string<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
all I'm going to do is string on the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.059 
all I'm going to do is string on the
Bali<00:03:09.090> beep<00:03:09.330> first<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.530> I'm<00:03:10.709> going<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.950> do<00:03:11.040> just

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
Bali beep first and I'm going to do just

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
Bali beep first and I'm going to do just
as<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.760> did<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.239> top<00:03:12.420> I'm<00:03:13.349> going<00:03:13.530> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
as we did for the top I'm going to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.289 
as we did for the top I'm going to
string<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.950> through<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.519> bottom<00:03:14.700> hole<00:03:14.849> in

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
string it through the bottom hole in

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.699 
string it through the bottom hole in
this<00:03:15.750> case<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.220> another<00:03:17.849> Valley<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:22.530> is

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
this case and another Valley this is

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.440 
this case and another Valley this is
also<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.459> technique<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.150> would<00:03:24.269> use

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
also the technique that you would use

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.330 
also the technique that you would use
for<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.750> single<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.430> single<00:03:26.430> strand<00:03:28.340> bracelet

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
for a single a single strand bracelet

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.910 
for a single a single strand bracelet
and<00:03:29.750> really<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.110> only<00:03:31.349> thing<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.620> need<00:03:31.799> to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
and really the only thing you need to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.740 
and really the only thing you need to
remember<00:03:32.130> when<00:03:32.400> working<00:03:32.579> with<00:03:32.819> elasticity<00:03:33.269> is

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
remember when working with elasticity is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.330 
remember when working with elasticity is
that<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:35.120> beads<00:03:36.120> your<00:03:37.190> measurements<00:03:38.190> going

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
that your beads your measurements going

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.890 
that your beads your measurements going
to<00:03:38.430> change<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.790> little<00:03:38.880> bit<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.690> on

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
to change a little bit because it is on

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.350 
to change a little bit because it is on
elastic<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:41.160> not<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.760> necessarily<00:03:41.880> be

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
elastic it's not going to necessarily be

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.150 
elastic it's not going to necessarily be
as<00:03:42.660> long<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.440> were<00:03:43.530> building<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
as long as if you were building a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.770 
as long as if you were building a
regular<00:03:44.549> bracelet<00:03:44.970> where<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.209> were<00:03:45.329> crimping

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
regular bracelet where you were crimping

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.650 
regular bracelet where you were crimping
and<00:03:45.930> using<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.319> toggle<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.920> clasp<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.269> I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
and using the toggle in the clasp so I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.550 
and using the toggle in the clasp so I
would<00:03:49.130> check<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:51.180> against<00:03:51.480> my<00:03:51.690> wrist<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.349> I'm

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
would check it against my wrist as I'm

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.289 
would check it against my wrist as I'm
stringing<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:53.910> make<00:03:54.060> sure<00:03:54.090> I'm

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
stringing it just to make sure I'm

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.680 
stringing it just to make sure I'm
getting<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.630> right<00:03:54.780> size<00:03:55.700> okay<00:03:56.730> again<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.269> have

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
getting the right size okay again I have

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.110 
getting the right size okay again I have
come<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> end<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.670> started<00:04:00.000> with

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
come to the end here and I started with

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.180 
come to the end here and I started with
the<00:04:00.150> valley<00:04:00.840> bead<00:04:01.139> first<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.859> my<00:04:01.980> knot

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
the valley bead first so that my knot
