00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
course then that's why a OE slows us so

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.010 
course then that's why a OE slows us so
so<00:04:39.699> good<00:04:39.849> even<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.270> put<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.539> trap<00:04:40.810> for

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
so good even just put in the trap for

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.600

abilities that are thrown in at the same
time<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:02.020> tank<00:06:02.289> needs<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:02.620> get<00:06:02.740> prioritized

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
time that tank needs to get prioritized

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.430 
time that tank needs to get prioritized
on<00:06:03.669> healing<00:06:04.030> you<00:06:04.270> need<00:06:04.389> to<00:06:04.479> use<00:06:04.659> your<00:06:05.139> tank

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
on healing you need to use your tank

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.409 
on healing you need to use your tank
cooldowns<00:06:05.830> when<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.190> quake<00:06:06.669> stops<00:06:07.030> come<00:06:07.270> in

cooldowns when the quake stops come in

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.330 
cooldowns when the quake stops come in
make<00:06:08.020> sure<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:08.289> keep<00:06:08.409> this<00:06:08.560> tank<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.099> full

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.899 
elf very very important and I mean you
could<00:06:11.320> one<00:06:11.650> tank<00:06:11.979> this<00:06:12.159> fight<00:06:12.370> there's<00:06:12.759> also

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
could one tank this fight there's also

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.790 
could one tank this fight there's also
another<00:06:13.240> ability<00:06:13.599> called<00:06:13.750> snapping<00:06:14.320> bite<00:06:14.530> and

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
another ability called snapping bite and

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.230 
another ability called snapping bite and
this<00:06:14.889> deals<00:06:15.159> a<00:06:15.340> very<00:06:15.610> large<00:06:15.849> amount<00:06:16.030> of

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
this deals a very large amount of

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.060 
this deals a very large amount of
physical<00:06:16.659> damage<00:06:16.810> with<00:06:17.530> armor<00:06:17.889> and

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
physical damage with armor and

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.589 
physical damage with armor and
mitigation<00:06:18.729> everything<00:06:19.210> like<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:19.360> it's

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
mitigation everything like that it's

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.640 
mitigation everything like that it's
around<00:06:19.870> 250<00:06:20.680> came<00:06:20.889> without<00:06:21.130> any<00:06:21.310> cooldowns

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
around 250 came without any cooldowns

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.730 
around 250 came without any cooldowns
so<00:06:23.650> yeah<00:06:24.190> it's<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:24.610> not<00:06:24.849> very<00:06:25.210> nice<00:06:26.139> movie

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
so yeah it's it's not very nice movie

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.950 
so yeah it's it's not very nice movie
it's<00:06:27.099> very<00:06:27.699> very<00:06:27.909> likely<00:06:28.150> that<00:06:28.449> every<00:06:28.780> time

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
it's very very likely that every time

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.570 
it's very very likely that every time
the<00:06:29.080> snapping<00:06:29.440> bite<00:06:29.620> comes<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:30.099> from<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.430> boss

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
the snapping bite comes in from the boss

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.640 
the snapping bite comes in from the boss
it'll<00:06:31.210> take<00:06:31.419> you<00:06:31.630> below<00:06:32.020> that<00:06:32.500> 350<00:06:33.460> K<00:06:33.639> health

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
it'll take you below that 350 K health

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.559 
it'll take you below that 350 K health
which<00:06:35.400> means<00:06:35.639> all<00:06:35.729> about<00:06:35.909> to<00:06:36.060> heal<00:06:36.210> themself

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569
