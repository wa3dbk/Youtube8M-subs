gadgets or any of this other junk it's a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
gadgets or any of this other junk it's a
really<00:00:58.979> simple<00:00:59.309> process<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.420> way<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> do

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
really simple process and the way I do

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.899 
really simple process and the way I do
it<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> garlic<00:01:01.799> practically<00:01:02.339> jumps<00:01:02.729> out<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
it the garlic practically jumps out of

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.320 
it the garlic practically jumps out of
the<00:01:03.030> shell<00:01:04.610> rather<00:01:05.610> than<00:01:05.850> having<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.210> go

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the shell rather than having to go

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330 
the shell rather than having to go
through<00:01:06.360> any<00:01:06.690> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.930> complex<00:01:07.890> method<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
through any kind of complex method of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.899 
through any kind of complex method of
peeling<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.190> think<00:01:11.190> we<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.880> need

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
peeling it so I think we really do need

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
peeling it so I think we really do need
another<00:01:12.299> garlic<00:01:13.110> crushing<00:01:13.470> video<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.549> you

know rather than sit here and talk about

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.830 
know rather than sit here and talk about
it<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> distance<00:01:18.299> why<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.600> come<00:01:18.720> on

and I'll show you why well you'll be
pretty<00:02:10.709> apparent<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
pretty apparent to you when I get to it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
pretty apparent to you when I get to it
I'm<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:15.959> right<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I'm just going to get right to the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
I'm just going to get right to the
crushing<00:02:16.769> part<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.629> we<00:02:18.810> cut

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
crushing part so what we do is we cut

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.089 
crushing part so what we do is we cut
through<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.920> root<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.560> cut<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> root

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
through the root just to cut the root

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.620 
through the root just to cut the root
off<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.530> back<00:02:25.829> end

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
off just like that that back end

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.050 
off just like that that back end
and<00:02:28.630> then<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.050> cut<00:02:29.290> through<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.740> top<00:02:30.130> end<00:02:30.820> also

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
and then we cut through the top end also

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.520 
and then we cut through the top end also
that<00:02:31.420> ended<00:02:31.870> sprouts<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:35.080> can<00:02:35.200> keep<00:02:35.350> those

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that ended sprouts and we can keep those

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.250 
that ended sprouts and we can keep those
little<00:02:35.830> pieces<00:02:36.010> without<00:02:36.910> scan<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.660> course<00:02:37.900> can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
little pieces without scan of course can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.900 
little pieces without scan of course can
come<00:02:38.440> throw<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.680> off<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.010> those<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:42.490> keep<00:02:42.670> those

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
come throw it off of those we keep those

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.480 
come throw it off of those we keep those
over<00:02:43.270> episodic<00:02:43.750> because<00:02:43.930> they're<00:02:44.490> usable

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
over episodic because they're usable

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.870 
over episodic because they're usable
they're<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.050> not<00:02:47.050> going<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> crushed<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> now

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
they're just not going to crushed so now

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.970 
they're just not going to crushed so now
how<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.540> crush<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.990> garlic<00:02:50.440> well<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.890> it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
how do we crush this garlic well here it

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.920 
how do we crush this garlic well here it
is<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.340> pretty<00:02:51.610> simple<00:02:51.880> I'm<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:52.780> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
is this is pretty simple I'm going to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.500 
is this is pretty simple I'm going to
cut<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.290> remaining<00:02:54.280> part<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> garlic

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
cut this remaining part of the garlic

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.080 
cut this remaining part of the garlic
into<00:02:55.750> quarters<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.640> cut<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> quarter<00:02:58.710> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
into quarters so I cut the quarter and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260 
into quarters so I cut the quarter and
through<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> center<00:03:01.510> another<00:03:02.020> quarter<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
through the center another quarter and

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.540 
through the center another quarter and
then<00:03:04.810> down<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> last<00:03:05.620> part<00:03:06.450> quarter<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
then down to the last part quarter and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.070 
then down to the last part quarter and
now<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.610> can<00:03:12.850> see<00:03:13.030> why<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.300> didn't<00:03:13.630> bother<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
now you can see why I didn't bother to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.160 
now you can see why I didn't bother to
peel<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.800> garlic<00:03:14.830> because<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:16.870> cut<00:03:17.050> it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
peel the garlic because when you cut it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.880 
peel the garlic because when you cut it
this<00:03:17.290> way<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.940> shell<00:03:19.590> from<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.710> garlic

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
this way the shell from the garlic

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.520 
this way the shell from the garlic
pretty<00:03:21.400> much<00:03:21.610> falls<00:03:22.450> right<00:03:22.690> away<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.140> garlic

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
pretty much falls right away that garlic

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.750 
pretty much falls right away that garlic
practically<00:03:24.100> jumps<00:03:24.550> out<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> shell<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
practically jumps out of the shell and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.559 
practically jumps out of the shell and
just<00:03:27.760> knock<00:03:28.210> that<00:03:28.240> over<00:03:28.720> there<00:03:28.900> so

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.830 

so<00:03:32.230> here<00:03:32.379> we<00:03:32.500> have<00:03:33.000> four<00:03:34.000> quarters<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.510> garlic

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
so here we have four quarters of garlic

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.170 
so here we have four quarters of garlic
at<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.409> press<00:03:35.590> that's<00:03:35.769> pretty<00:03:35.980> simple<00:03:36.220> use

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
at the press that's pretty simple use

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.580 
at the press that's pretty simple use

you're<00:03:38.739> not<00:03:38.860> comfortable<00:03:39.670> whacking<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.599> sharp

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you're not comfortable whacking a sharp

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.970 
you're not comfortable whacking a sharp
knife<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.959> use<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> pancake<00:03:44.530> turner<00:03:44.739> or

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
knife you can use a pancake turner or
