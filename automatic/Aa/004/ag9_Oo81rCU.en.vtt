disperse 52 fifties smaller wheels so I

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.860 
disperse 52 fifties smaller wheels so I
mean<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.580> means<00:02:05.760> is<00:02:05.970> just<00:02:06.180> lighter<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.720> makes

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.750 
mean that means is just lighter it makes
your<00:02:06.990> board<00:02:07.260> it<00:02:07.470> makes<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:07.740> lighter<00:02:07.980> your

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
your board it makes it lighter your

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.090 
your board it makes it lighter your
board<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.290> bad<00:02:10.470> thing<00:02:10.650> about<00:02:10.740> them

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
board and but the bad thing about them

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.840 
board and but the bad thing about them
is<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.460> get<00:02:12.440> into<00:02:13.440> crack<00:02:13.860> easier<00:02:14.220> they

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
is that they get into crack easier they

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.800 
is that they get into crack easier they
get<00:02:15.090> bumps<00:02:15.870> would<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.470> fall<00:02:16.770> off<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:17.070> board
