and I bring you an episode six of black
ops<00:00:15.969> 101<00:00:16.420> today<00:00:16.720> now<00:00:17.380> in<00:00:17.500> this<00:00:17.590> episode<00:00:17.770> we're

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
ops 101 today now in this episode we're

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.530 
ops 101 today now in this episode we're
gonna<00:00:18.279> be<00:00:18.369> taking<00:00:18.700> a<00:00:18.730> look<00:00:18.880> at<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.090> different

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
gonna be taking a look at the different

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.030 
gonna be taking a look at the different
running<00:00:19.779> times<00:00:20.200> that<00:00:20.439> you<00:00:20.560> have<00:00:20.740> when<00:00:21.009> you're

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
running times that you have when you're

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.470 
running times that you have when you're
holding<00:00:21.310> different<00:00:21.880> weapons

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
holding different weapons

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.990 
holding different weapons
so<00:00:22.689> in<00:00:23.020> black<00:00:23.650> ops<00:00:23.920> whichever<00:00:24.400> weapon<00:00:24.849> you're

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
so in black ops whichever weapon you're

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.760 
so in black ops whichever weapon you're
holding<00:00:25.390> determines<00:00:25.840> your<00:00:25.960> run<00:00:26.170> speed<00:00:26.439> so<00:00:26.680> if

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
holding determines your run speed so if

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.929 
holding determines your run speed so if
you're<00:00:26.890> running<00:00:27.009> with<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.279> light<00:00:27.579> weapon

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
you're running with a light weapon

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.400 
you're running with a light weapon
you're<00:00:28.090> gonna<00:00:28.180> run<00:00:28.419> faster<00:00:28.960> than<00:00:29.110> when<00:00:29.290> you're

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
you're gonna run faster than when you're

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.889 
you're gonna run faster than when you're
holding<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.739> heavy<00:00:29.860> weapon<00:00:30.340> like<00:00:30.460> an<00:00:30.579> LMG<00:00:31.060> so

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
holding a heavy weapon like an LMG so

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.210 
holding a heavy weapon like an LMG so
let's<00:00:32.230> go<00:00:32.290> ahead<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.500> get<00:00:32.560> started<00:00:32.860> with<00:00:33.040> the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
let's go ahead and get started with the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.400 
let's go ahead and get started with the
assault<00:00:33.520> rifles<00:00:34.000> now<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.600> assault<00:00:35.020> rifles

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
assault rifles now the assault rifles

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.580 
assault rifles now the assault rifles
have<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.620> 95%<00:00:36.610> speed<00:00:37.329> so<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:37.690> know<00:00:37.899> 100<00:00:38.290> percent

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
have a 95% speed so you know 100 percent

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.430 
have a 95% speed so you know 100 percent
is<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.950> fastest<00:00:39.430> you<00:00:39.579> can<00:00:39.610> go<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.480> it's<00:00:40.660> 5%<00:00:40.899> off

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
is the fastest you can go so it's 5% off

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.110 
is the fastest you can go so it's 5% off
of<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:41.739> so<00:00:41.950> I<00:00:41.980> mean<00:00:42.100> it's<00:00:42.250> not<00:00:42.309> too<00:00:42.640> bad<00:00:42.850> but

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
of that so I mean it's not too bad but

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.060 
of that so I mean it's not too bad but
it<00:00:43.330> is<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.540> little<00:00:43.810> bit<00:00:43.930> different<00:00:44.320> now<00:00:45.010> the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
it is a little bit different now the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.430 
it is a little bit different now the
SMGs<00:00:45.700> are<00:00:45.970> obviously<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.630> hundred<00:00:46.960> percent<00:00:47.320> you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
SMGs are obviously a hundred percent you

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.020 
SMGs are obviously a hundred percent you
know<00:00:47.560> those<00:00:47.740> bad<00:00:47.950> boys<00:00:48.220> are<00:00:48.400> really<00:00:48.670> light<00:00:48.820> so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
know those bad boys are really light so

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.450 
know those bad boys are really light so
you<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.150> run<00:00:49.450> really<00:00:49.840> fast<00:00:50.080> now<00:00:50.980> moving<00:00:51.160> on<00:00:51.340> to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
you can run really fast now moving on to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.870 
you can run really fast now moving on to
the<00:00:51.550> LMG<00:00:52.120> here<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.500> has<00:00:53.800> an<00:00:53.950> 87<00:00:54.250> point<00:00:54.790> 5

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
the LMG here this has an 87 point 5

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.240 
the LMG here this has an 87 point 5
percent<00:00:55.300> run<00:00:55.690> rate<00:00:55.930> which<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.530> slowest<00:00:57.100> in

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
percent run rate which is the slowest in

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.490 
percent run rate which is the slowest in
the<00:00:57.400> game<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:57.880> you<00:00:58.780> know<00:00:58.900> these<00:00:59.050> things<00:00:59.290> are

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
the game and you know these things are

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.650 
the game and you know these things are
huge<00:00:59.800> they're<00:01:00.100> actually<00:01:00.490> almost<00:01:01.060> impossible

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
huge they're actually almost impossible

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.750 
huge they're actually almost impossible
to<00:01:01.750> carry<00:01:01.900> in<00:01:02.079> real<00:01:02.260> life<00:01:02.470> it's<00:01:02.770> know<00:01:03.460> this<00:01:03.670> is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
to carry in real life it's know this is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.249 
to carry in real life it's know this is
a<00:01:03.790> video<00:01:04.059> game<00:01:04.269> so<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.629> course<00:01:04.869> you've<00:01:05.049> got<00:01:05.079> to

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
a video game so of course you've got to

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.569 
a video game so of course you've got to
be<00:01:05.320> able<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.560> carry<00:01:05.770> them<00:01:05.890> but<00:01:06.159> for<00:01:06.460> that

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
be able to carry them but for that

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.850 
be able to carry them but for that
reason<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:07.090> run<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.299> lot<00:01:07.540> slower<00:01:07.900> I'm<00:01:08.439> now

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
reason you run a lot slower I'm now

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.100 
reason you run a lot slower I'm now
moving<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.430> we've<00:01:09.759> got<00:01:09.790> these<00:01:10.270> shotguns<00:01:10.869> and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
moving on we've got these shotguns and

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.100 
moving on we've got these shotguns and
the<00:01:11.229> sniper<00:01:11.530> now<00:01:12.130> both<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.460> these<00:01:12.729> are<00:01:12.790> at<00:01:13.450> 100%

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
the sniper now both of these are at 100%

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.920 
the sniper now both of these are at 100%
run<00:01:14.620> rate<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.700> don't<00:01:16.300> really<00:01:16.570> know<00:01:16.750> why<00:01:16.900> I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
run rate and I don't really know why I

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.690 
run rate and I don't really know why I
mean<00:01:17.200> shotguns<00:01:17.680> are<00:01:17.800> kind<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.100> small<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.460> well

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
mean shotguns are kind of small as well

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.610 
mean shotguns are kind of small as well
but<00:01:18.970> snipers<00:01:19.510> those<00:01:19.750> are<00:01:19.870> pretty<00:01:20.140> big<00:01:20.320> things

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
but snipers those are pretty big things

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.410 
but snipers those are pretty big things
I<00:01:20.830> think<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.130> thing<00:01:21.310> about<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:22.030> you

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
I think the thing about it is is you

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.120 
I think the thing about it is is you
know<00:01:22.450> you're<00:01:22.720> kind<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:22.990> at<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.170> disadvantage<00:01:23.380> in

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
know you're kind of at a disadvantage in

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.980 
know you're kind of at a disadvantage in
close-range<00:01:24.909> battles<00:01:25.300> with<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.479> sniper<00:01:25.720> so

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
close-range battles with a sniper so

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.210 
close-range battles with a sniper so
they<00:01:26.080> tried<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.380> even<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.860> out<00:01:26.920> with<00:01:27.190> a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
they tried to even that out with a

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.420 
they tried to even that out with a
quicker<00:01:27.549> run<00:01:27.850> right<00:01:28.060> now<00:01:29.010> if<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.100> take<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.280> look

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
quicker run right now if you take a look

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.770 
quicker run right now if you take a look
at<00:01:30.549> all<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.670> graphs<00:01:30.940> here<00:01:31.240> I'm<00:01:31.450> gonna<00:01:31.570> go

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
at all the graphs here I'm gonna go

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.630 
at all the graphs here I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.020> put<00:01:32.140> these<00:01:32.229> lines<00:01:32.530> up<00:01:32.860> there's<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
ahead and put these lines up there's the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.140 
ahead and put these lines up there's the
87.5<00:01:34.479> line<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.900> 95%<00:01:35.380> line<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.070> 100%<00:01:36.430> line<00:01:36.850> so

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
87.5 line the 95% line and 100% line so

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.300 
87.5 line the 95% line and 100% line so
as<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.479> can<00:01:37.600> see<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:38.950> like<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:39.190> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
as you can see here this is like if it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.730 
as you can see here this is like if it
was<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.640> race<00:01:39.880> at<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> certain<00:01:40.720> time<00:01:40.990> period<00:01:41.290> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
was in a race at a certain time period a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.740 
was in a race at a certain time period a
race<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.610> take<00:01:42.790> control<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.299> middle<00:01:43.510> part

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
race to take control of that middle part

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.800 
race to take control of that middle part
of<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.930> map<00:01:44.110> as<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.380> can<00:01:44.500> see<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.860> cracked<00:01:45.250> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of the map as you can see on cracked and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.719 
of the map as you can see on cracked and
as<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.619> see<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.890> hundred<00:01:48.159> percents<00:01:48.520> will

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
as you can see the hundred percents will

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.910 
as you can see the hundred percents will
get<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.090> where<00:01:49.240> they<00:01:49.360> are<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:50.200> assault<00:01:50.560> rifles

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
get to where they are the assault rifles

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.649 
get to where they are the assault rifles
which<00:01:51.100> are<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> 95<00:01:51.760> percent<00:01:52.210> are<00:01:52.360> gonna<00:01:52.450> get

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
which are a 95 percent are gonna get

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.000 
which are a 95 percent are gonna get
kind<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:52.930> close<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.470> they're<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> little

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
kind of close to that they're a little

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.950 
kind of close to that they're a little
bit<00:01:54.130> behind<00:01:54.250> though<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.270> LMG<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.780> gonna

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
bit behind though and the LMG is gonna

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.750 
bit behind though and the LMG is gonna
be<00:01:56.080> lagging<00:01:56.320> way<00:01:56.650> behind<00:01:56.680> he's<00:01:57.250> only<00:01:57.400> gonna<00:01:57.580> be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
be lagging way behind he's only gonna be

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.460 
be lagging way behind he's only gonna be
at<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.939> car<00:01:58.180> at<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.510> start<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> street<00:01:59.260> by

again I'm running faster I'm running at

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.990 
again I'm running faster I'm running at
that<00:02:49.389> 100%<00:02:49.599> rate<00:02:50.439> so<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.700> only<00:02:51.760> problem

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
that 100% rate so but the only problem

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699 
that 100% rate so but the only problem
with<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.269> one<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.719> you<00:02:52.959> don't<00:02:53.109> have<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.260> gun<00:02:53.500> up
