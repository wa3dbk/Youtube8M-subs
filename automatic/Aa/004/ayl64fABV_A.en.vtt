00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
I believe you can use all the weapons

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
I believe you can use all the weapons
just<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.110> Skyrim<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:34.860> matter<00:00:35.040> what

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
just like Skyrim and don't matter what

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
just like Skyrim and don't matter what
class<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.050> access<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
class you are so you do get access to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.080 
class you are so you do get access to
all<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> weapons<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> armor<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

categories<00:00:41.790> inside<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> can

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
categories inside of them that you can

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
categories inside of them that you can
level<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> plus<00:00:44.760> beside

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
one skill point per level and since I'm

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.650

I mean 22 of the skill points from just
leveling<00:01:00.239> itself<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.469> once<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:01.920> max

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
level which I believe is 50 right now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
level which I believe is 50 right now
I'm<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.710> sure<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> missed<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.430> tell

right<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.290> these<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:20.040> extra

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
right now these are how you get extra

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.649 
right now these are how you get extra
snow<00:01:20.520> points<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> skill<00:01:21.390> point

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
snow points you can get a skill point

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.679 
snow points you can get a skill point
per<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.970> skyshard<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> find<00:01:24.479> they

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
per of skyshard that you find they

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
per of skyshard that you find they
extend<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> light<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.619> far<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> air

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
extend the light pretty far into the air

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.649 
extend the light pretty far into the air
they're<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
they're not that

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.840 
they're not that

they're not that easy to miss and I mean

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.670 
they're not that easy to miss and I mean
you<00:01:31.000> have<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.299> I<00:01:31.570> mean<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.080> can<00:01:32.229> see<00:01:32.409> them<00:01:32.500> when

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680

you have to I mean you can see them when
they're<00:01:32.770> pretty<00:01:32.979> folks<00:01:33.250> but<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.030> only<00:01:34.210> thing

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
they're pretty folks but the only thing

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.060 
they're pretty folks but the only thing
about<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.930> they<00:01:35.110> are<00:01:35.290> located<00:01:35.920> like

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
about it is they are located like

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.609 
about it is they are located like
randomly<00:01:37.060> throughout<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.600> math<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.110> will<00:01:38.440> be

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
randomly throughout the math I will be

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.710 
randomly throughout the math I will be
although<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.640> been<00:01:39.790> recording<00:01:40.119> every<00:01:40.570> one

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
although I have been recording every one

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.440 
although I have been recording every one
I<00:01:40.750> got<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:41.740> far<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.310> tracking<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.060> on<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.270> map

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
I got so far and tracking it on the map

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.020 
I got so far and tracking it on the map
so<00:01:43.689> expect<00:01:44.200> when<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.500> find<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.070> lot<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.280> them<00:01:45.520> I'm

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
so expect when I find a lot of them I'm

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.149 
so expect when I find a lot of them I'm
not<00:01:46.149> fumbling<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.659> make<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> video<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
not fumbling to make a video on that I

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.830 
not fumbling to make a video on that I
will<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.670> showing<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.940> guys<00:01:49.090> locations<00:01:49.690> of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
will be showing you guys locations of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.300 
will be showing you guys locations of
these<00:01:50.080> but<00:01:50.320> like<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.590> said<00:01:50.860> they<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.100> little

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
these but like I said they are little

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.859 
these but like I said they are little
getting<00:01:51.580> randomly<00:01:52.030> throughout<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.479> map<00:01:52.659> this

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
getting randomly throughout the map this

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.649 
getting randomly throughout the map this
game<00:01:53.369> emphasizes<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> lot<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:54.759> exploration<00:01:55.509> and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
game emphasizes a lot on exploration and

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.600 
game emphasizes a lot on exploration and
stuff<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.289> because<00:01:56.560> not<00:01:57.190> only<00:01:57.250> do<00:01:57.549> you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
stuff like that because not only do you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.609 
stuff like that because not only do you
have<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.909> explore<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.479> get<00:01:58.899> skill<00:01:59.229> points

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
have to explore now to get skill points

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.410 
have to explore now to get skill points
after<00:02:00.159> level<00:02:00.430> cap<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.819> won't<00:02:01.060> be<00:02:01.179> getting

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
after level cap you won't be getting

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.419 
after level cap you won't be getting
them<00:02:01.509> from<00:02:01.659> levels<00:02:02.110> anymore<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.369> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
them from levels anymore so this is the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.010 
them from levels anymore so this is the
only<00:02:03.580> way<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.819> will<00:02:04.030> begin<00:02:04.179> skill<00:02:04.569> points<00:02:04.840> but

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
only way you will begin skill points but

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.960 
only way you will begin skill points but
you<00:02:05.289> also<00:02:05.710> have<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.039> find<00:02:06.159> mage<00:02:06.429> books<00:02:06.729> and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
you also have to find mage books and

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.969 
you also have to find mage books and
stuff<00:02:07.179> like<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.810> level<00:02:08.140> up<00:02:08.289> guild<00:02:08.709> rings

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
stuff like that to level up guild rings

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.979 
stuff like that to level up guild rings
