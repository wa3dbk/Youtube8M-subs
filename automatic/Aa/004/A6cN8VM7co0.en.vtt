00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.710
 cutting the ham is an art 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.690
 a good cut of the pieces allows us to obtain its best texture flavor and 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.149
 performance 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.309
 the palette we will find three well differentiated parts 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.249
 the mass against mace 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.460
 we will place it in the ham holder with the hoof upwards or what is it 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.289
 same with the mass towards us 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.470
 to start with the escort knife we ​​will make a cross section in the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 highest part of the cone or as deep as bones allow 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.470
 then with the scrapping knife we ​​will join the two ends 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.990
 this cut will not serve as a stop when it comes to cutting 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 the next step the debarking the pallet 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.030
 we will remove the bark and the yellow fat but always leaving hidden or 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 two centimeters of bacon covering the muscular part of the palette 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.690
 if we are not going to make a quick discourteous consumption we will do as we go 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.840
 consuming we will begin to cut the palette by the mace 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.780
 For this we will look for reference the longitudinal axis of the pallet 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.189
 we will be making parallel cuts to this and we will start from the highest part 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 the palette that is the front leg of the pig 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 It has less use than ham for its higher fat content and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.620
 for not having the back of the leg 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.520
 the biggest difference in the cut with respect to the ham is the bone of the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 fan corresponds to the scapula and covers much of the surface of 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.330
 cut 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.120
 making this task difficult 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.630
 as we move forward the bones of the coveted and fan will disappear 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.570
 With the car you must enjoy we will mark and continue the cut 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.340
 This operation is the most important for an optimal use of the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.040
 palette 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.829
 because it allows us to slice more easily and maintain a straight cut 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.920
 with a firm pulse on the ham knife we ​​will count the ones that are very thin 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.960
 avoiding holes that spoil the tasting of the product 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.010
 we will continue cutting until we reach the union between the fan and listed 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.869
 At that point we will turn the palette continue cutting through the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.939
 countermarch 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.940
 in the palette as in the ham 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.769
 is the club the most infiltrated and tasty and offers a more colorful cut 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.489
 the counter mace is also very tasty although more pristine degree 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.460
 we started cutting from the highest part of the palette 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
 in direction from the knuckle to the counter in a straight and parallel line 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.660
 to the cut that we have previously the countermarch of the palette has a lower 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.179
 advantage that the mace 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.489
 when we find ourselves with the union bone of the homeroom cane and the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.079
 bones of the code 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.400
 as we cut off the same tastes as the mass the humerus will disappear 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.249
 fan 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.479
 with a prominent union that will appear in the center of the spot 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.089
 we skirted it with the knife should go and continue cutting 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.089
 until I do not do that, let us get out more uniform minds 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.959
 when we finish denouncing we can take advantage of the rest of the palette 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.959
 to the bones helping us with the car to taste 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.369
 you can continue cutting the palette by the sides and thus we will obtain several 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.229
 bastions more than the chats 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.479
 the rest of the palette can be used in tacos or taquitos 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.209
 the bones once cut by our butcher are very appreciated for 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.719
