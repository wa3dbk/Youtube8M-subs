fiberglass that's rotted stuck will be

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.550

gaps<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> cloud<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:35.659> OSB<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.560> tell

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
gaps in the cloud would OSB you can tell

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.100 
gaps in the cloud would OSB you can tell
it's<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:37.890> marine<00:01:38.280> gray

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's not marine gray

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
it's not marine gray
we'll<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.159> low<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> goes<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we'll see how low it goes but it's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.710 
we'll see how low it goes but it's
pretty<00:01:42.329> wet<00:01:43.790> could<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.240> I've<00:01:45.450> had<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
pretty wet could be because I've had it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800 
pretty wet could be because I've had it
outside<00:01:45.840> since<00:01:46.259> I've<00:01:46.409> gotten<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.659> was

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
outside since I've gotten it but it was

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.069 
outside since I've gotten it but it was
already<00:01:49.020> rotted<00:01:49.500> um<00:01:50.450> before<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> ever<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.960> it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
already rotted um before I ever got it

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.429 
already rotted um before I ever got it
here<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.790> coming<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> pieces

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
here it was just really coming to pieces

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
here it was just really coming to pieces
pretty<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.430> easy<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:57.119> tearing<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pretty pretty easy I was tearing it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.450 
pretty pretty easy I was tearing it
pretty<00:01:58.170> much<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.530> bare<00:01:58.680> hands<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.100> wanted

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
pretty much for my bare hands I wanted

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
pretty much for my bare hands I wanted
to<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.299> did<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> pry

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to but I did have a little bit of a pry

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
to but I did have a little bit of a pry
bar<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.899> been<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> few<00:02:04.259> minutes

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
bar with me it's been a few minutes

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780 
bar with me it's been a few minutes
doing<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.979> think<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.310> spent<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.579> time

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
doing that I think I spent more time

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.719 
doing that I think I spent more time
cleaning<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.960> mess<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:08.220> where<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> did

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
cleaning up my mess from where I did

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.199 
cleaning up my mess from where I did
tear<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.720> hauling<00:02:10.349> off<00:02:11.209> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
tear it out and actually hauling off the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.260 
tear it out and actually hauling off the
garbage<00:02:12.450> from<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> boat

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
garbage from the boat

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.910 
garbage from the boat
I<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.020> spent<00:02:14.170> more<00:02:14.380> time<00:02:14.440> doing<00:02:14.620> that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I think I spent more time doing that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
I think I spent more time doing that
than<00:02:15.100> actually<00:02:15.400> tearing<00:02:15.670> out<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.840> floor

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
than actually tearing out the floor

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.020 
than actually tearing out the floor
which<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:18.010> thought<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> spend

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
which I thought I was going to spend

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.790 
which I thought I was going to spend
lots<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.420> times<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.290> said<00:02:20.470> before<00:02:20.590> I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
lots of times because as I said before I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.540 
lots of times because as I said before I
had<00:02:21.810> circular<00:02:22.810> saw<00:02:23.050> hammers<00:02:23.770> all<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.280> stuff

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
had circular saw hammers all that stuff

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.720 
had circular saw hammers all that stuff
just<00:02:24.820> kind<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.260> nearby<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.590> only<00:02:27.190> ended<00:02:27.640> up

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
just kind of nearby and only ended up

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
just kind of nearby and only ended up
using<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:28.030> hammer<00:02:28.210> and<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> pry<00:02:28.540> bar<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.650> anyway

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
using a hammer and a pry bar so anyway

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.760 
using a hammer and a pry bar so anyway
that's<00:02:30.730> all<00:02:31.030> said<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.420> done<00:02:31.510> moving<00:02:32.290> forward

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
that's all said and done moving forward

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.910 
that's all said and done moving forward
I<00:02:33.250> believe<00:02:33.520> my<00:02:33.970> next<00:02:34.470> bit<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:36.490> do<00:02:36.610> would<00:02:36.880> be

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I believe my next bit of to do would be

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.310 
I believe my next bit of to do would be
making<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.100> cradle<00:02:39.670> making<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.600> stand<00:02:40.900> for<00:02:41.230> my

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
making a cradle making a stand for my

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.750 
making a cradle making a stand for my
motor<00:02:41.590> because<00:02:41.860> I'm<00:02:42.070> going<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.430> pull<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
motor because I'm going to pull the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.590 
motor because I'm going to pull the
motor<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> also<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.210> easier<00:02:46.480> on

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
motor and also to make it easier on

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240 
motor and also to make it easier on
myself<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.230> stringers<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.830> right<00:02:48.010> way

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
myself and do stringers the right way

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.300 
myself and do stringers the right way
I'm<00:02:49.180> separating<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.840> hole<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.590> lot<00:02:51.220> of

the motor separating the hole getting

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.470 
the motor separating the hole getting
ready<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.740> do<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.340> stringer<00:03:45.820> replacement
