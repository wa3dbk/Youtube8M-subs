00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
forward 3/8 of an inch so that means I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.730

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.900 
concept of going forward 3/8 of an inch
back<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.360> back<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:22.080> eighth<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.620> inch

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
back one back one eighth of an inch

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.310 
back one back one eighth of an inch
which<00:02:23.910> leaves<00:02:24.210> me<00:02:24.390> an<00:02:24.630> eighth<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.080> an<00:02:25.230> inch

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
which leaves me an eighth of an inch

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:35.390 
which leaves me an eighth of an inch
space<00:02:26.540> again<00:02:27.540> forward<00:02:28.110> 3/8<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:29.070> an<00:02:29.220> inch<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
space again forward 3/8 of an inch and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.729 
space again forward 3/8 of an inch and
you<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.540> watch<00:02:36.780> me<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.230> these<00:02:37.380> videos

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
you see if you watch me in these videos

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.090 
you see if you watch me in these videos
I<00:02:38.010> start<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> work<00:02:38.820> with<00:02:39.630> my<00:02:39.810> fabric<00:02:40.230> facing

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
I start to work with my fabric facing

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.430 
I start to work with my fabric facing
this<00:02:41.220> way<00:02:41.280> instead<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:43.260> find

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
this way instead of this way I just find

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.370 
this way instead of this way I just find
it<00:02:43.620> easier<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.060> find<00:02:45.840> things<00:02:46.020> come<00:02:46.290> out

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
it easier for me I find things come out

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.580 
it easier for me I find things come out
straighter<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.220> way<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
straighter that way but this is what the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.340 
straighter that way but this is what the
stitch<00:02:49.860> should<00:02:50.130> look<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.900> an<00:02:51.900> eighth<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.260> an

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
stitch should look like an eighth of an

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.720 
stitch should look like an eighth of an
inch<00:02:52.410> stitch<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:53.190> an<00:02:53.280> eighth<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.580> an<00:02:53.670> inch

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
inch stitch with an eighth of an inch

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.130 
inch stitch with an eighth of an inch
space<00:02:55.190> again<00:02:56.450> back<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.630> eighth<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.930> an<00:02:58.019> inch

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
space again back in eighth of an inch

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:08.130 
space again back in eighth of an inch
and<00:02:59.010> forward<00:03:01.430> 3/8<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.700> an<00:03:02.850> inch

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.260 

I<00:03:08.170> can't<00:03:08.890> decorate<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.460> and<00:03:09.820> just<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> show

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
I can't decorate in it and just to show

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.370 
I can't decorate in it and just to show
you<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.750> what<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.930> looks<00:03:11.080> like<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
you this is what it looks like on the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.100 
you this is what it looks like on the
back<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.890> looks<00:03:11.920> kind<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.940> messy<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.930> does

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
back it looks kind of messy and it does

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.870 
back it looks kind of messy and it does
look<00:03:14.320> like<00:03:14.350> it's<00:03:14.890> an<00:03:15.010> overlapping<00:03:15.430> stitch

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
look like it's an overlapping stitch

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.490 
look like it's an overlapping stitch
because<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.270> does<00:03:16.420> overlap<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.290> front

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
because it does overlap and on the front

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.710 
because it does overlap and on the front
you<00:03:17.800> shouldn't<00:03:18.520> see<00:03:18.670> any<00:03:18.700> overlap<00:03:19.270> and<00:03:19.540> all

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
you shouldn't see any overlap and all

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.810 
you shouldn't see any overlap and all
the<00:03:20.050> spacing<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.800> stitches<00:03:21.310> should<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:21.970> equal
