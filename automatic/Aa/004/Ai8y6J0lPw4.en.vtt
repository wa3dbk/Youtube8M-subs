 I chose the subject of this video but 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.099
 now that you know below 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.680
 some theme related to the world of dance 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 What do you think is cool is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.740
 talking with you in my opinion 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 So you see here but we 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.160
 video bring my opinion I'll tell 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.710
 you 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 the theme chosen this time was the style 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 of a good dancer she many people 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 they look at the dancer as if she were the one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 little thing all pink that cute thing 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.449
 class clipboard 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 yes, that's often, but I'm going to give 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.879
 my opinion today to you about this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.219
 theme is ballet and does not interfere with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 a person in the style of the dancer she 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.439
 opted chose ballet because she likes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.110
 because she feels good doing but the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.299
 style the way she dresses the way 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 that she speaks what she has to hear the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 What does she have to like to bring down? 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 from friends these things I think ballet 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 does not interfere with this and often 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 some people think this way 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.189
 Because she's a dancer, she's marina souza. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 ballerina pink can only listen to music 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 classic knows and this we do not have 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 nothing to see 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.299
 people often think that more 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 I came here today to tell you and who 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.799
 think of this way to open new 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.829
 a new Persian rug that is not just 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.360
 this is you can opt for the ballet but 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.700
 you do not necessarily need to be 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.189
 Always listening to classical music, and you? 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.979
 May be liking rock the pop 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.030
 I finally do ballet, I'm a ballet dancer and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.990
 for love 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.360
 I love bittles, I love Ramones. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.210
 of the times styles that have nothing to do 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 with ballet above all the pop I love pop 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.130
 and there is not even a ballet near any type 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200
 Classical music to me. 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.890
 perfecting more in dance than I 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.659
 I chose to do 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.580
 people like that choose the type of dance 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.649
 the one that make her like that she 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.680
 It feels good to do but not 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.959
 necessarily need to follow 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.300
 definitely the world around her 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.980
 Ballerina does not have to wear pink clothes. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 time that many times the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.630
 people think she is fofinha is 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.140
 Guy because she's a dancer, not people. 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.870
 Ballerina can be is bold can use 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.880
 black clothes can ever dare her 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.920
 Do you want to use it and I 'm leaving some 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.110
 here in the course of the video that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.660
 some dancers that I watch 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.340
 taste and that only the judge inspirations so 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 in the world of dance that they are 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.800
 dancers they took this very seriously 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 She is at my age 13 and leads to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.660
 dance as a sport and as life 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 It's their job. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.330
 So it's a publishing house that's 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.170
 a great dancer she simply 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.330
 perfect in the world of dance and she does not use 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.420
 and she had no people she is not cute 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.450
 she dares her children she uses us 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.570
 looks at her and you're playing her then 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.360
 She uses a lot of looks. She wears black. 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.130
 She's good rock too sometimes and 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.650
 she has been like that since she has always been 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.019
 change started and I think it's kind of 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.070
 everything because she is a dancer she is 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.769
 dancer is her job and year takes 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.690
 this world as well as the series as the 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.630
 The way a dancer should bitch 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.540
 the balloon ballet or dance interfere in 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.340
 way a person say you can yes 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.070
 wear any clothes you want to wear 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.570
 any style that does not interfere with me 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.360
 I see many people who are of the type 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.579
 outside plates you pass with you you 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.950
 will not even imagine that person is 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:58.200
 dancer or dancer knows she uses 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:01.230
 All in black. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.930
 end use a lot of thing is rock knows 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.450
 those two really good ones look like 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.290
 I go where and when you will meet the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.660
 person 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.810
 You see you're a super kind person. 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.000
 different, she's also a cute person 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.490
 even wearing that kind of clothing and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.920
 now 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.360
 they inhabit type does not interfere with ballet 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.459
 none of this my opinion on this 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.440
 subject is that in fact bullet has not yet 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.840
 There's a style for me there in that one. 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.730
 person who will dedicate what will do 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.190
 all who are doing what they love 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.170
 loves to dance that they are loved 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.210
 interpret a character who is 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.340
 person you will see on stage you 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.380
 You will say this is a dancer that is the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.220
 Ballerina Mayor knows the ballerina 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.720
 me and this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.150
 and above all, the dancer does not have a 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.010
 style chile and colombia should be is 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.880
 person she was then if you like 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.800
 rock 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.170
 If you like to dress like you, okay? 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.120
 like a waiter look you listen to you 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.460
 You do not have to be always using rosinha 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.140
 You're cute, wearing a little dress. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.930
 you will follow a style that you are 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.580
 independent flames and dancer or not 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.560
 the customization for you because I 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.390
 I know it's a subject that a lot of people 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.520
 thinks the dancer has to follow 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.360
 dancer and if you have nothing to 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.400
 to see 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.660
 my opinion is that ballack does not have one 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.580
 Ballerina's own style is interpreted 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.770
 something and does what he likes but does not have a 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.470
 style of the gallery floor in the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.450
 style of the person she really is 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 So this is my opinion on this. 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.720
 theme 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.910

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.620
