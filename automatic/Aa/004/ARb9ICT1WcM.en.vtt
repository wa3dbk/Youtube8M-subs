00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 no 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.489
 it's been several months of work that's why ideas and advice for 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.460
 a show that is the team town that actually allow to sell if the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 belgium at the international level it was our number 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.979
 in europe she goes to primary 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.680
 it is true that it is hard 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.300
 the juices in the project is beautiful the base 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 after that it's true 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440
 pharmagest% think that 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.030
 from a general genetic point of view I know that not always happen 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.040
 obvious from 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 to tune violins 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270
 between every hour between each rich country I think it's because he 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.760
 love something 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.200
 of fundamental that fire than to create alliances between different countries 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.300
 so me there I think I'm here 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.710
 it's sometimes complicated and I think it's an important step 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220
 it's something we have to launch in the long run the presidency is a 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.010
 opportunity 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 we know something that must last after so I really hope that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.870
 this version 7 meetings and then it can last beyond the presidency 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.030
 but now it's obviously a great time for the departure of a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 other relationship between Brussels residents and the European institutions 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 the european union that represents a lot of things 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.800
 I always want to ignore 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.080
 this is a very many sign I am really happy 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 and symbolically this evening for europe is strong because 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.300
 because I really have to say to myself that we really need 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.730
 that we are conscious 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.150
 it is important 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.030
 to get together so that things move 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.979
 so you need love you need to avoid I think you do not talk 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.080
 policy 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.350
 I'm leaving with the hands 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.630
 we must continue to ask for a change of regime or a language of the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.460
 body 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 google 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.649
 I think that the European Union can be a force for 100% a 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.039
 first he denies the facts 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.269
 a source close to six 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 to change the world in quite a way 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.359
 e positive and 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.499
 with this seventh of the world 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.309
 what can be shown to others 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.989
 that people maybe they do not understand that they do not share 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.139
 the same language can still share the same principles 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.139
 and even if small 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.019
 no 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.159
 20 hours
