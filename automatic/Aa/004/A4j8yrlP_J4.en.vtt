00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.740
 there are special ones for fishing again 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.050
 route but you can say it does not exist 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.250
 the route for fishing again but it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.840
 are different routes for 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.090
 There are different areas of application 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 sorry maybe many routes medium 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.580
 Routing again and forth ran red again 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.240
 because of the difference 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.960
 completely right we have just for the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.380
 different areas and there 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.080
 thought made we start with 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 one easily rested that is 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.270
 Of course at first very easy in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.729
 the hand lying the connection of the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.390
 individual elements in the case are three 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.940
 parts 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.979
 These are normal hofer 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.110
 connectors are also very 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.540
 important to get a complete one 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 circular bend curve gets the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.060
 through to the proportion sticking out 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.160
 Lengths of easily many routes are in 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.870
 usually around 350 to 355 and the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 Of course, tips are very light 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.620
 and very much that starts in this 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.799
 case of 0.5 is an ounce there you can 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 the finest so far 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.170
 weights in the easy again range would 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.750
 I declare from 10 to about 45 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.769
 gram 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 the next area would be the medium 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.320
 Again we have one 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 to come up with a special system and 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.799
 Although we are working here with an extreme 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.720
 long sword connection granted 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.739
 or , of course, guarantees us a lot 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.650
 throw wide and you can load 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.170
 see that until the end of the sword 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.730
 there is hardly a bend in the route 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.720
 So of course, accordingly 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.519
 a lot of backbone and from the first leadership 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.670
 ring then begins the complete 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.180
 parabolica action in the medium range 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.269
 Of course not designed too strong so 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.819
 in about 45 to 100 grams of feed or 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.439
 warmer at about 110 115 grams 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.319
 and then of course there are in parallel 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.510
 again the heavy area again 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.819
 Similar routes are the same 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.189
 Of course, the connection is made difficult by the handlebar 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.200
 a bit more powerful then designed with 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.900
 accordingly stronger tips the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.010
 in the chemical field, the peaks in 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.959
 about 345 can also be 6 ounces in the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.000
 medium range are the tips 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.139
 somewhere between one and two maximum 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.419
 two and a half ounces 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.950
 then one can say medium for that is 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.629
 An all-around route can do it that way 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.790
 say and Harry really like that then 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.590
 for the extreme completely correct if I am myself 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.329
 now only one route should choose 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.219
 then I would always consider myself a medium 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.540
 decide which is very versatile 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.040
 You can fish in the quiet water there 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.380
 it is easier to fish with current 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.930
 you can already distances of 75 m 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.880
 sometimes with longer and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.740
 the hÃ¤fler area that's just special 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.050
 so for the strong current one 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.139
 extreme extreme range heavier forage 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.300
 are body-sized fish from construction ago 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.620
 the routes stop just medium 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.210
 and help only half the stronger 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.210
 design then okay
