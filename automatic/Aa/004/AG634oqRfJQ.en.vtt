00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
very good job of it I'll let you hear it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:53.700

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.550 
got the tone knob at about twelve
o'clock<00:01:01.580> as<00:01:02.030> well<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.630> there's<00:01:03.170> also<00:01:03.380> a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
volume knob a little mini knob that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.170 
volume knob a little mini knob that
allows<00:01:05.870> you<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.380> balance<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.190> volume<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
allows you to balance the volume of the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.050 
allows you to balance the volume of the
distortion<00:01:08.650> where<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.770> effected<00:01:10.610> signal

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
distortion where the effected signal

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.530 
distortion where the effected signal
versus<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.020> volume<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.540> unaffected

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
versus the volume of the unaffected

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.620 
versus the volume of the unaffected
signal<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.490> use<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.880> as<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.000> gain<00:01:20.300> boost

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
signal you can use it as a gain boost

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.109 
signal you can use it as a gain boost
and<00:01:20.990> increase<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.100> volume<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.700> can<00:01:22.880> match<00:01:23.090> it

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and increase the volume you can match it

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.680 
and increase the volume you can match it
at<00:01:23.450> unity<00:01:23.810> gain<00:01:24.290> whatever<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.830> like<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.160> do<00:01:25.690> it

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
at unity gain whatever you like to do it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.530 
at unity gain whatever you like to do it
has<00:01:26.930> plenty<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.350> Drive<00:01:27.790> for<00:01:28.790> kind<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.119> bluesy

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
has plenty of Drive for kind of a bluesy

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.270 
has plenty of Drive for kind of a bluesy
tone<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.229> have<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.470> back<00:01:30.650> off<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.190> the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
tone you really have to back off on the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:47.770 
tone you really have to back off on the
drive

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:00.170 

that's<00:01:48.780> almost<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.970> of

that's almost all the way down and of
course<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.720> turn<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.200> drive<00:02:01.500> knob<00:02:01.830> up

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
course you can turn that drive knob up

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.630 
course you can turn that drive knob up
and<00:02:02.400> get<00:02:03.150> lots<00:02:03.480> of<00:02:03.750> gain<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.550> edge

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and get lots of gain put a little edge

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:21.940 
and get lots of gain put a little edge
on<00:02:05.910> it
