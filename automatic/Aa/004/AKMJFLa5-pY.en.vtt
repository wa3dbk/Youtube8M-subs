00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
through the phone that's not that's why

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.520

I'm not using a jigsaw or anything else

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.310 
I'm not using a jigsaw or anything else
because<00:04:33.310> now<00:04:33.550> I'm<00:04:33.640> going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.850> cut<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.060> foam

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
because now I'm going to cut the foam

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.510 
because now I'm going to cut the foam
smaller<00:04:35.320> on<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.590> inside<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.100> actually<00:04:36.370> leave

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
smaller on the inside and actually leave

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.030 
smaller on the inside and actually leave
a<00:04:36.550> lip<00:04:36.910> within<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.720> trunk<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.320> modern<00:04:38.740> car

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.430 
a lip within the trunk like a modern car
has<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:39.850> it<00:04:39.970> could<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.120> watertight<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.350> I'm

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
has so it could be watertight so I'm

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.870 
has so it could be watertight so I'm
just<00:04:41.560> using<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:41.950> just<00:04:42.370> enough<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.700> cut

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
through the fiberglass so heavy pressure

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.370 
through the fiberglass so heavy pressure
can<00:04:45.910> make<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.120> wheel<00:04:46.270> jump<00:04:46.600> off<00:04:46.720> line<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
can make the wheel jump off line so

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.860 
can make the wheel jump off line so
begin<00:04:47.680> lightly<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.130> cut<00:04:48.340> straight<00:04:48.750> take<00:04:49.750> your

lip I don't already have to do this if
you're<00:06:21.520> making<00:06:21.789> this<00:06:21.879> part<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:23.800> was<00:06:23.949> one<00:06:24.159> way

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:24.309 
you're making this part it was one way

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:26.279 
you're making this part it was one way
we<00:06:24.580> felt<00:06:24.759> we<00:06:24.939> could<00:06:25.089> do<00:06:25.210> that<00:06:25.389> make<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.229> a

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
we felt we could do that make it a

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.230 
we felt we could do that make it a
little<00:06:26.439> a<00:06:26.680> little<00:06:27.610> more<00:06:27.729> like<00:06:27.879> a<00:06:27.909> production

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
little a little more like a production

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.360 
little a little more like a production
part<00:06:28.689> so<00:06:29.229> we're<00:06:29.379> giving<00:06:29.649> it<00:06:29.740> a<00:06:29.800> try

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
part so we're giving it a try

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.239 
part so we're giving it a try
it<00:06:31.029> seems<00:06:31.270> you're<00:06:31.389> working<00:06:31.659> okay<00:06:31.899> so<00:06:31.960> far<00:06:32.349> for

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:33.249 
it seems you're working okay so far for

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:34.980 
it seems you're working okay so far for
this<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.520> work<00:06:33.610> well<00:06:33.879> try<00:06:34.419> to<00:06:34.479> make<00:06:34.659> the<00:06:34.779> cut

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
this to work well try to make the cut

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.749 
this to work well try to make the cut
very<00:06:35.229> shallow<00:06:35.589> so<00:06:35.949> the<00:06:36.039> remaining<00:06:36.339> foam<00:06:36.610> is

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
very shallow so the remaining foam is

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.089 
very shallow so the remaining foam is
not<00:06:36.939> hurt<00:06:37.180> however<00:06:37.839> if<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.289> foam<00:06:38.499> is<00:06:38.680> damaged

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.639 
not hurt however if the foam is damaged
it<00:06:39.310> can<00:06:39.460> be<00:06:39.520> replaced<00:06:39.639> with<00:06:40.089> new<00:06:40.330> pieces<00:06:40.649> up

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:41.649 
it can be replaced with new pieces up

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:42.989 
it can be replaced with new pieces up
