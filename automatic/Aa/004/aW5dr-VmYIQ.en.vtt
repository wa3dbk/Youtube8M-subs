00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the adjustability much again like the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
the adjustability much again like the
Titleist<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.609> dual<00:00:59.940> adjustability

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
Titleist it's got dual adjustability
which<00:01:01.410> means<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.160> alter<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> loft<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
which means you can alter the loft of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.359 
which means you can alter the loft of
the<00:01:03.329> golf<00:01:03.629> club<00:01:03.840> without<00:01:04.409> affecting<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the golf club without affecting the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
the golf club without affecting the
actual<00:01:05.880> face<00:01:06.330> angle<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.020> an

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
actual face angle and that's an

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.219 
actual face angle and that's an
important<00:01:07.740> part<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.299> independent

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
important part so it's it's independent

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
important part so it's it's independent
changing<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.640> love<00:01:11.909> and

changing here so you can do love and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.350 
changing here so you can do love and
face<00:01:12.780> angle<00:01:13.460> independently<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.909> really

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
face angle independently and I really

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
face angle independently and I really
like<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.290> means<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.740> fine-tune<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like that it means you can fine-tune the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
like that it means you can fine-tune the
ball<00:01:17.670> fly<00:01:17.909> exactly<00:01:18.150> how<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.500> I'm
