this emergency driving course every two

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.709 
this emergency driving course every two
years<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.579> do<00:00:36.760> all<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:36.940> our<00:00:37.120> driver<00:00:37.390> training

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
years we do all of our driver training

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.500 
years we do all of our driver training
out<00:00:37.899> here<00:00:38.079> at<00:00:38.200> Pacific<00:00:38.620> raceways<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:40.300> it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
out here at Pacific raceways because it

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
out here at Pacific raceways because it
offers<00:00:40.840> us<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.290> ability<00:00:41.469> to<00:00:41.710> do<00:00:42.010> some

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
offers us the ability to do some

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.729 
offers us the ability to do some
high-speed<00:00:42.989> pursuit<00:00:43.989> training<00:00:44.469> and

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
high-speed pursuit training and

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.890 
high-speed pursuit training and
emergency<00:00:45.070> driver<00:00:45.640> training<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.660> there's<00:00:46.810> a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
emergency driver training so there's a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.720 
emergency driver training so there's a
combination<00:00:47.560> of<00:00:47.710> several<00:00:48.579> different

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
time to brake all you have time is to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.100 
time to brake all you have time is to
recognize<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:04.970> do<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> quick<00:02:05.480> lane<00:02:05.780> change

I don't care which way you decide to go

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.210 
I don't care which way you decide to go
but<00:02:08.420> you'll<00:02:08.660> mix<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.020> up<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:09.590> right<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.010> time

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
but you'll mix it up go right one time

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.980 
but you'll mix it up go right one time
then<00:02:10.490> go<00:02:10.520> left<00:02:10.820> sometimes<00:02:11.270> don't<00:02:11.660> keep<00:02:11.840> going

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
then go left sometimes don't keep going
