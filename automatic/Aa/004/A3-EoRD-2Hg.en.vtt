00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
75 and 8,500 I would say the 8500 has

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.520 
75 and 8,500 I would say the 8500 has
slightly<00:02:00.310> deeper<00:02:00.520> blacks<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:02.110> comparing

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
the two for gaming the HU 7500 is

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.900 
the two for gaming the HU 7500 is

slightly more responsive the HU 8500 has

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.360 
slightly more responsive the HU 8500 has

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
a quad core plus processor while the HU

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.699 
a quad core plus processor while the HU
7500<00:02:13.269> has<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.840> standard<00:02:14.170> quad<00:02:14.440> core

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.970 
7500 has just a standard quad core
processor<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.060> AU<00:02:16.380> 8500<00:02:17.380> should<00:02:17.860> be

processor so the AU 8500 should be

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.520 
processor so the AU 8500 should be
slightly<00:02:18.280> faster<00:02:19.120> when<00:02:19.870> you're<00:02:20.019> running<00:02:20.170> the
