gonna be able to tighten it up or loosen

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.340 
gonna be able to tighten it up or loosen
it<00:01:23.250> correctly<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.970> they're<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.630> enough<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it correctly and they're not enough to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
it correctly and they're not enough to
actually<00:01:25.740> damage<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.189> filter<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:27.119> poke<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
actually damage the filter or poke a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.760 
actually damage the filter or poke a
hole<00:01:27.540> through<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.530> gonna

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
hole through it so you're not gonna

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
hole through it so you're not gonna
cause<00:01:28.979> any<00:01:29.189> leaks<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.420> next<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.930> to

show you exactly how this clamps onto an

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
show you exactly how this clamps onto an
oil<00:01:33.180> filter<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:34.020> we're<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.259> get

filter with this and then we're gonna
install<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.270> new<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.560> well

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
install the new one just to see how well

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.569 
install the new one just to see how well
the<00:01:41.100> 1491<00:01:41.899> actually<00:01:42.899> works<00:01:43.220> okay<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> show<00:01:44.520> you

it right over top of this purolator and
then<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.670> we'll<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.119> clamp<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
then what we'll do is clamp it down so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.539 
then what we'll do is clamp it down so
you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.710> there's<00:01:55.920> still<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.189> little<00:01:56.340> bit

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you can see there's still a little bit

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
you can see there's still a little bit
of<00:01:56.640> play<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.930> order<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> clamp<00:01:58.590> down

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
of play there and in order to clamp down

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
of play there and in order to clamp down
that<00:01:59.070> force<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.969> need<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.659> turn

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that force all you need to do is turn

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.800 
that force all you need to do is turn
the<00:02:01.200> forcing<00:02:01.799> screw<00:02:02.159> clockwise<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:03.570> tighten

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the forcing screw clockwise to tighten

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.160 
the forcing screw clockwise to tighten
it<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.759> as<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.000> tightens<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.719> band<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it up and as it tightens the band is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
it up and as it tightens the band is
gonna<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:07.560> tight<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.670> actual

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
gonna get very tight around the actual

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.540 
gonna get very tight around the actual
filter<00:02:09.239> itself<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.739> once<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.129> bottoms

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
filter itself and then once it bottoms

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
filter itself and then once it bottoms
out<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.180> stop<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.900> now<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
out you can just stop and now the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.590 
out you can just stop and now the
filter<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.920> secure<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.420> how<00:02:15.540> that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
filter is secure you can see how that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
filter is secure you can see how that
band<00:02:15.990> wraps<00:02:16.440> around<00:02:16.710> there<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.670> those

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
band wraps around there and all those

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.630 
band wraps around there and all those
little<00:02:18.120> dots<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.810> actually<00:02:19.230> little

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
little dots are actually little

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.250 
little dots are actually little
indentations<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.880> are<00:02:21.270> pressing<00:02:21.780> into<00:02:22.020> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
indentations that are pressing into the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.280 
indentations that are pressing into the
actual<00:02:22.860> surface<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> filter<00:02:24.210> itself<00:02:24.360> so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
actual surface of the filter itself so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.470 
actual surface of the filter itself so
you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:25.950> me<00:02:26.070> twisting<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.880> it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you can see it was me twisting this it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
you can see it was me twisting this it's
not<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:28.140> anywhere<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.550> wanted<00:02:29.820> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
not going anywhere and if I wanted to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.180 
not going anywhere and if I wanted to
either<00:02:30.360> loosen<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.110> or<00:02:31.260> tighten<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
either loosen it or tighten it up I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.670 
either loosen it or tighten it up I
could<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.640> very<00:02:32.910> easily<00:02:33.200> because<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
could do that very easily because of the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.080 
could do that very easily because of the
beta<00:02:34.920> 1491

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
beta 1491

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.020

oil<00:02:36.510> filter<00:02:36.990> wrench<00:02:37.020> now<00:02:37.980> let's<00:02:38.340> say<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.550> break

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
oil filter wrench now let's say I break

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
oil filter wrench now let's say I break
it<00:02:39.210> free<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.290> want<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> continue<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> turn

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it free and I want to continue to turn

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.070 
it free and I want to continue to turn
it<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.210> I'll<00:02:42.360> need<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.930> just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it then all I'll need to do is just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.860 
it then all I'll need to do is just
loosen<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.800> slightly<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.540> oil

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
loosen this up slightly then the oil

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
loosen this up slightly then the oil
filter<00:02:46.260> wrench<00:02:46.290> will<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.950> rotate<00:02:47.520> I'll

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
filter wrench will actually rotate I'll

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.170 
filter wrench will actually rotate I'll
retighten<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.070> can<00:02:50.430> continue<00:02:50.820> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
retighten it and then I can continue to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.360 
retighten it and then I can continue to
either<00:02:51.360> loosen<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.990> or<00:02:52.200> tighten<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.710> as<00:02:52.890> needed

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
either loosen it or tighten it as needed

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.730 
either loosen it or tighten it as needed
because<00:02:54.030> sometimes<00:02:54.600> he<00:02:54.750> still<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.470> come

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
because sometimes he still will not come

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.470 
because sometimes he still will not come
off<00:02:55.920> very<00:02:55.950> easily<00:02:56.490> right<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> beginning

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
off very easily right at the beginning

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.110 
off very easily right at the beginning
and<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.590> may<00:02:58.770> need<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> oil<00:02:59.250> filter<00:02:59.760> wrench

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and you may need the oil filter wrench

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330 
and you may need the oil filter wrench
to<00:03:00.390> turn<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:00.990> full<00:03:01.350> revolution<00:03:02.130> before

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
to turn it one full revolution before

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.360 
to turn it one full revolution before
you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.790> actually<00:03:02.940> spin<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> off<00:03:03.660> by<00:03:03.900> hand

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
you can actually spin it off by hand

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.310 
you can actually spin it off by hand
okay<00:03:05.370> here's<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.760> oil<00:03:05.790> filter<00:03:06.330> on<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.510> 2003

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
okay here's the oil filter on a 2003

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.530 
okay here's the oil filter on a 2003
Honda<00:03:07.350> Pilot<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.280> typically<00:03:09.180> I'll<00:03:09.330> use<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
Honda Pilot and typically I'll use a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.720 
Honda Pilot and typically I'll use a
large<00:03:09.900> set<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.290> oil<00:03:10.650> filter<00:03:11.040> pliers<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
large set of oil filter pliers and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
large set of oil filter pliers and
squeeze<00:03:12.360> down<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.290> crush<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
squeeze down on this it will crush in

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.890 
squeeze down on this it will crush in
the<00:03:14.010> sides<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.550> filter<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.630> can

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the sides of the filter and then I can

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.440 
the sides of the filter and then I can
rotate<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> loosen<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.100> up<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:18.000> instead<00:03:18.300> of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
rotate it to loosen it up but instead of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.860 
rotate it to loosen it up but instead of
using<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.020> I'm<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.620> use<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.070> beta

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
using this I'm going to use the beta

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.230 
using this I'm going to use the beta

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
you can see just holding this in place

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.380 
you can see just holding this in place
I'm<00:03:35.040> able<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.400> tighten<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.850> band<00:03:36.120> very

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
I'm able to tighten that band very

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.720 
I'm able to tighten that band very
easily<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.170> now<00:03:37.740> just<00:03:37.980> pressing<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.490> it<00:03:38.610> with

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
easily and now just pressing on it with

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.090 
easily and now just pressing on it with
my<00:03:38.880> thumb<00:03:39.180> should<00:03:40.080> be<00:03:40.260> enough<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.680> loosen<00:03:41.010> this

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
my thumb should be enough to loosen this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.400 
my thumb should be enough to loosen this
filter<00:03:41.490> up<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:42.870> see<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.080> filters

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
filter up you can see the filters

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.710 
filter up you can see the filters
rotating<00:03:44.100> at<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.670> point<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.209> need<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.570> do

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
rotating at this point all I need to do

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.080 
rotating at this point all I need to do
is<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:46.140> loosen<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.160> forcing<00:03:47.640> screw<00:03:47.910> back

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
is just loosen that forcing screw back

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.810 
is just loosen that forcing screw back
up<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.860> what<00:03:49.860> I'll<00:03:49.980> do<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.310> remove<00:03:50.670> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
up and what I'll do is remove it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.280 
up and what I'll do is remove it
completely<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:51.930> one<00:03:51.959> that's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
completely but if you have one that's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.320 
completely but if you have one that's
really<00:03:52.410> stuck<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.160> could<00:03:53.790> actually<00:03:53.970> rotate

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
really stuck you could actually rotate

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.420 
really stuck you could actually rotate
it<00:03:54.630> back<00:03:54.840> again<00:03:55.230> retighten<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.250> then

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
it back again retighten it and then

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.729 
it back again retighten it and then
force<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.880> back<00:03:57.060> out<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.390> way<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.380> since<00:03:58.620> I

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
force it back out of the way but since I

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.470 
force it back out of the way but since I
already<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> filter<00:03:59.580> loosened<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:00.209> now

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
already have the filter loosened I'm now

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.320 
already have the filter loosened I'm now
able<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.989> remove<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.650> very<00:04:02.280> easily<00:04:02.550> by<00:04:03.030> hand

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
able to remove it very easily by hand

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.770 
able to remove it very easily by hand
because<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.500> beta<00:04:04.860> 1491<00:04:05.790> oil<00:04:06.150> filter<00:04:06.540> wrench

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
because the beta 1491 oil filter wrench

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.470 
because the beta 1491 oil filter wrench
was<00:04:07.200> able<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.560> loosen<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.920> up<00:04:08.100> for<00:04:08.370> me<00:04:08.520> when

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
was able to loosen this up for me when

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.850 
was able to loosen this up for me when
you<00:04:09.600> want<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> install<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.380> new<00:04:10.410> filter

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
you want to install the new filter

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.370 
you want to install the new filter
you'll<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.459> take<00:04:11.610> some<00:04:11.880> new<00:04:12.060> oil<00:04:12.390> make<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.260> go

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
you'll just take some new oil make it go

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.350 
you'll just take some new oil make it go
around<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.890> actual<00:04:14.310> rubber<00:04:14.550> gasket<00:04:15.209> itself

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
around the actual rubber gasket itself

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.500 
around the actual rubber gasket itself
so<00:04:15.900> nothing<00:04:16.200> hangs<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:17.030> then<00:04:18.030> you'll<00:04:18.209> put<00:04:18.390> it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
so nothing hangs up then you'll put it

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.260 
so nothing hangs up then you'll put it
on<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.080> actual<00:04:19.470> mounting<00:04:19.919> point<00:04:20.250> spin<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.060> on

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.590 

and<00:04:26.470> then<00:04:27.470> you'll<00:04:27.620> hand<00:04:27.950> tighten<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.300> let's

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
and then you'll hand tighten it so let's

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.530 
and then you'll hand tighten it so let's
say<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.840> want<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.110> go<00:04:30.230> around<00:04:31.090> 3/4<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.300> turn

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
say you want to go around 3/4 of a turn

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.200 
say you want to go around 3/4 of a turn
but<00:04:33.020> all<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.590> turn<00:04:33.890> it<00:04:34.070> by<00:04:34.340> hand<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.970> maybe

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
but all you can turn it by hand is maybe

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.980 
but all you can turn it by hand is maybe
half<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.140> turn<00:04:36.380> that's<00:04:37.190> where<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.630> 1491<00:04:38.630> is

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
half a turn that's where the 1491 is

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.110 
half a turn that's where the 1491 is
going<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.290> help<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.740> because<00:04:40.580> what<00:04:40.790> we'll<00:04:40.940> do

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
going to help you because what we'll do

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.270 
going to help you because what we'll do
at<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.390> point<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.960> slip<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.500> over<00:04:42.800> top<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:43.010> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
at this point is slip it over top of the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.260 
at this point is slip it over top of the
brand<00:04:43.640> new<00:04:43.880> filter<00:04:44.920> tighten<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.040> up<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.460> as

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
brand new filter tighten it up just as

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.090 
brand new filter tighten it up just as
we<00:04:47.450> did<00:04:47.600> when<00:04:47.840> we<00:04:47.870> wanted<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.290> loosen<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.890> and

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
we did when we wanted to loosen it and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.190 
we did when we wanted to loosen it and
now<00:04:49.880> we're<00:04:50.060> going<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> rotate<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.900> clockwise

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
now we're going to rotate it clockwise

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.740 
now we're going to rotate it clockwise
in<00:04:51.980> order<00:04:52.160> for<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:52.700> tighten<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.300> actual

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
in order for it to tighten the actual

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.290 
in order for it to tighten the actual
new<00:04:53.960> filter<00:04:54.380> up<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:55.220> now<00:04:55.520> that's<00:04:55.790> tightened

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
new filter up so now that's tightened

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.840 
new filter up so now that's tightened
down<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.780> now<00:04:57.200> we<00:04:57.260> can<00:04:57.560> rotate<00:04:57.950> this<00:04:58.430> filter

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
down and now we can rotate this filter

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.880 
down and now we can rotate this filter
clockwise<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.900> tighten<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.320> up<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.590> final

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
clockwise to tighten it up that final

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.290 
clockwise to tighten it up that final
quarter<00:05:01.400> turn<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:03.610> that's<00:05:04.610> all<00:05:04.790> there<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
quarter turn and that's all there is to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.590 
quarter turn and that's all there is to
it

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
it

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.420 
it
now<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:05.840> would<00:05:06.200> just<00:05:06.380> release<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.190> tension

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
now you would just release the tension

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.840 
now you would just release the tension
on<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.880> forcing<00:05:08.540> screw<00:05:08.840> itself<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.730> then<00:05:10.730> you

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
on the forcing screw itself and then you

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.140 
on the forcing screw itself and then you
can<00:05:11.000> remove<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.560> 1491<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.670> filter<00:05:14.000> is

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
can remove the 1491 and the filter is

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.180 
can remove the 1491 and the filter is
installed<00:05:14.600> correctly<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.440> it's<00:05:15.680> not<00:05:15.860> going

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
installed correctly and it's not going

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.610 
installed correctly and it's not going
to<00:05:16.280> leak<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.330> notice<00:05:17.780> along<00:05:18.320> here

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
to leak and if you notice along here

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.680 
to leak and if you notice along here
there's<00:05:18.860> no<00:05:19.100> damage<00:05:19.610> it<00:05:19.760> did<00:05:19.880> not<00:05:20.000> crush<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.540> in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
there's no damage it did not crush it in

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.110 
there's no damage it did not crush it in
and<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.350> did<00:05:21.530> not<00:05:21.680> peel<00:05:22.010> any<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.640> pain<00:05:22.880> off

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
and it did not peel any of the pain off

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.330 
and it did not peel any of the pain off
or<00:05:23.450> cause<00:05:23.660> any<00:05:23.690> chipping<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.010> filter

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
or cause any chipping on the filter

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.330 
or cause any chipping on the filter
itself<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:27.200> now<00:05:27.440> you've<00:05:27.680> seen<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.100> betta
