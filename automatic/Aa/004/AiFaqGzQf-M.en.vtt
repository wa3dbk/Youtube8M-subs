00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
here it's kind of hard to see this is

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.720 
here it's kind of hard to see this is
still<00:03:43.720> shrink-wrapped<00:03:44.260> but<00:03:45.220> we<00:03:45.310> kind<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.579> have

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
still shrink-wrapped but we kind of have

still shrink-wrapped but we kind of have
the<00:03:45.850> title<00:03:46.269> up<00:03:46.510> here<00:03:46.650> as<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.890> watermark<00:03:48.630> it's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
the title up here as a watermark it's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.800 
the title up here as a watermark it's
subtle<00:03:49.989> but<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.380> can<00:03:50.530> read<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.660> think<00:03:52.660> that

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
subtle but you can read it I think that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.460 
subtle but you can read it I think that
looks<00:03:53.019> really<00:03:53.200> nice<00:03:54.209> same<00:03:55.209> with<00:03:55.360> this<00:03:55.510> one<00:03:55.570> and

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
looks really nice same with this one and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.310 
looks really nice same with this one and
look<00:03:57.010> I've<00:03:57.160> seen<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.459> bottom<00:03:57.760> corner<00:03:58.320> it's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
look I've seen the bottom corner it's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.069 
look I've seen the bottom corner it's
not<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.739> stark<00:04:00.340> white<00:04:00.579> text<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:01.750> more

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
not like a stark white text it's more

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.059 
not like a stark white text it's more
like<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.320> watermark<00:04:02.829> that<00:04:03.130> says<00:04:03.370> what

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
like a watermark that says what

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.610 
like a watermark that says what
