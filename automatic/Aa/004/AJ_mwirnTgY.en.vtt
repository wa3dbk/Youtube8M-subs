this<00:00:04.270> is<00:00:04.390> a<00:00:04.420> quick<00:00:04.690> video<00:00:04.990> about<00:00:05.020> protecting

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
this is a quick video about protecting

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.900 
this is a quick video about protecting
endgrain<00:00:06.130> when<00:00:06.490> you're<00:00:06.610> working<00:00:06.880> with

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
endgrain when you're working with

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.970 
endgrain when you're working with
Greenwood<00:00:07.480> especially<00:00:08.139> with<00:00:08.290> wide<00:00:08.500> boards

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
Greenwood especially with wide boards

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.129 
Greenwood especially with wide boards
the<00:00:09.910> reason<00:00:10.150> you<00:00:10.210> want<00:00:10.360> to<00:00:10.389> protect<00:00:10.720> end<00:00:10.929> grain

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
the reason you want to protect end grain

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.780 
the reason you want to protect end grain
is<00:00:11.170> because<00:00:11.679> grain<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:12.099> very<00:00:12.309> good<00:00:12.460> at<00:00:12.610> one

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
is because grain is very good at one

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.810 
is because grain is very good at one
thing<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.780> that<00:00:14.139> is<00:00:14.639> transferring<00:00:15.639> water

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
thing and that is transferring water

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.850 
thing and that is transferring water
from<00:00:16.240> one<00:00:16.360> end<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.630> another<00:00:16.720> that's<00:00:17.560> what<00:00:17.740> it's

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
from one end to another that's what it's

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.550 
from one end to another that's what it's
been<00:00:18.040> to<00:00:18.430> do<00:00:18.609> so<00:00:19.210> as<00:00:19.570> its<00:00:19.779> drying<00:00:20.050> out<00:00:20.320> you'll

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
been to do so as its drying out you'll

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.250 
been to do so as its drying out you'll
find<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.279> end<00:00:21.310> grain<00:00:21.640> trends<00:00:22.480> transfers

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
find that the end grain trends transfers

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.450 
find that the end grain trends transfers
a<00:00:23.289> lot<00:00:23.529> of<00:00:23.619> water<00:00:23.770> out<00:00:23.980> at<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.160> end<00:00:24.279> of<00:00:24.400> the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
a lot of water out at the end of the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.009 
a lot of water out at the end of the
boards<00:00:24.699> really<00:00:25.029> rapidly<00:00:25.449> and<00:00:25.750> when<00:00:25.900> that

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
boards really rapidly and when that

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.019 
boards really rapidly and when that
happens<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.650> shrinks<00:00:27.100> and<00:00:27.609> you<00:00:27.730> end<00:00:27.880> up<00:00:27.970> with

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
happens it shrinks and you end up with

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.570 
happens it shrinks and you end up with
checks<00:00:28.599> at<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.900> end<00:00:29.080> of<00:00:29.170> your<00:00:29.260> board<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:30.430> it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
checks at the end of your board so it's

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.040 
checks at the end of your board so it's
important<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.150> protect<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.840> from

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
important that you protect that from

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.320 
important that you protect that from
happening<00:00:32.280> and<00:00:33.280> I<00:00:33.489> was<00:00:33.879> trying<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.120> dry<00:00:34.269> this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
happening and I was trying to dry this

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.479 
happening and I was trying to dry this
board<00:00:34.719> out<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.840> little<00:00:35.020> quicker<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:36.160> I<00:00:36.219> let<00:00:36.460> it

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
board out a little quicker so I let it

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.030 
board out a little quicker so I let it
go<00:00:36.579> for<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:36.969> little<00:00:37.210> bit<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.540> it<00:00:38.530> started

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
go for a little bit and it started

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.220 
go for a little bit and it started
showing<00:00:39.309> signs<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:39.969> splitting<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.870> checking

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
showing signs of splitting and checking

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.200 
showing signs of splitting and checking
at<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.440> end<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:42.040> now<00:00:42.460> I'm<00:00:42.700> going<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:42.969> protect

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
at the end so now I'm going to protect

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.680 
at the end so now I'm going to protect
it<00:00:43.739> ideally<00:00:44.739> you'd<00:00:44.950> want<00:00:45.129> to<00:00:45.160> do<00:00:45.309> this<00:00:45.540> as<00:00:46.540> soon

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
it ideally you'd want to do this as soon

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.779 
it ideally you'd want to do this as soon
as<00:00:46.809> you<00:00:46.960> split<00:00:47.289> it<00:00:47.440> or<00:00:47.890> even<00:00:48.100> before<00:00:48.219> you<00:00:48.550> split

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
as you split it or even before you split

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.069 
as you split it or even before you split
it<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.190> don't<00:00:51.370> want<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.700> wood<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
it because you don't want the wood you

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.479 
it because you don't want the wood you
want<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.320> lose<00:00:53.500> any<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.980> lengths<00:00:54.160> of<00:00:54.399> your

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
want to lose any of the lengths of your

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.830 
want to lose any of the lengths of your
boards

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.479 

so<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.930> first<00:01:03.110> thing<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:03.410> do<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.860> cut<00:01:04.370> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
so the first thing you do is cut the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.030 
so the first thing you do is cut the
boards<00:01:04.820> remove<00:01:05.420> any<00:01:05.630> dirt<00:01:05.840> from<00:01:06.680> throwing

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
boards remove any dirt from throwing

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950 
boards remove any dirt from throwing
them<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.370> field<00:01:07.640> or<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.540> know<00:01:08.630> if<00:01:08.870> you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
them in the field or you know if you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.620 
them in the field or you know if you
have<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.110> rough<00:01:09.400> chainsaw<00:01:10.400> rash<00:01:10.640> that's<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.479> good

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
have a rough chainsaw rash that's a good

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690 
have a rough chainsaw rash that's a good
idea<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.260> cut<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> board<00:01:12.770> square<00:01:13.460> at<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
idea just to cut the board square at the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.420 
idea just to cut the board square at the
end<00:01:14.050> next<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.140> take<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> mixture<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:16.130> use

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
end next you take a mixture I use

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.480 
end next you take a mixture I use
mineral<00:01:17.330> oil<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:17.869> beeswax<00:01:18.410> some<00:01:19.100> people<00:01:19.340> also

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
mineral oil and beeswax some people also

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.510 
mineral oil and beeswax some people also
put<00:01:19.759> in<00:01:19.880> walnut<00:01:20.210> oil<00:01:20.920> or<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.190> use<00:01:22.280> olive

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
put in walnut oil or you can use olive

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.160 
put in walnut oil or you can use olive
oil<00:01:22.759> instead<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.210> mineral<00:01:23.479> oil<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.080> know

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
oil instead of mineral oil but you know

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.400 
oil instead of mineral oil but you know
it<00:01:24.259> does<00:01:24.410> go<00:01:24.560> rancid<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:26.150> prefer<00:01:26.810> using

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
it does go rancid so I prefer using

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.900 
it does go rancid so I prefer using
mineral<00:01:27.860> oil<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:28.310> case<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:28.759> some

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
mineral oil in case there's some

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.490 
mineral oil in case there's some
leftover<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.509> wood<00:01:29.660> it's<00:01:30.050> not<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:30.440> to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
leftover in the wood it's not going to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.910 
leftover in the wood it's not going to
be<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.619> problem<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:32.060> ratio<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.170> take<00:01:33.350> beeswax

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
be a problem the ratio is I take beeswax

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.219 
be a problem the ratio is I take beeswax
I<00:01:34.009> get<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.190> 5<00:01:34.399> pound<00:01:34.580> thing<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:35.030> beeswax<00:01:35.420> again

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
I get a 5 pound thing of beeswax again

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.070 
I get a 5 pound thing of beeswax again
from<00:01:36.440> Amazon<00:01:36.800> get<00:01:37.009> it<00:01:37.070> from<00:01:37.160> anywhere<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.080> and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
from Amazon get it from anywhere and and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.999 
from Amazon get it from anywhere and and
I'll<00:01:39.440> melt<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.890> down<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.430> then<00:01:41.320> mix<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.530> at<00:01:42.860> a

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
I'll melt that down and then mix it at a

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.219 
I'll melt that down and then mix it at a
ratio<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.399> about<00:01:43.550> two<00:01:44.270> parts<00:01:44.660> mineral<00:01:44.990> oil<00:01:45.110> to

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
ratio of about two parts mineral oil to

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
ratio of about two parts mineral oil to
one<00:01:45.530> part<00:01:45.560> beeswax<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.940> way<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.149> still<00:01:47.420> get

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
one part beeswax that way you still get

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.060 
one part beeswax that way you still get
a<00:01:47.630> decent<00:01:47.810> amount<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.140> penetration<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.950> then

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
a decent amount of penetration and then

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.380 
a decent amount of penetration and then
you<00:01:49.160> get<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.460> sealing<00:01:49.789> properties<00:01:50.270> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
you get the sealing properties that
