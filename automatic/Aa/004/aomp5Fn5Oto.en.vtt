I

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.900 

hey<00:00:11.530> what's<00:00:11.710> up<00:00:11.860> everyone's<00:00:12.400> missed<00:00:12.730> your

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
hey what's up everyone's missed your

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.360 
hey what's up everyone's missed your
crucial<00:00:13.330> here<00:00:13.480> on<00:00:13.630> my<00:00:13.750> test<00:00:14.080> world<00:00:14.410> have<00:00:15.219> you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
crucial here on my test world have you

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.970 
crucial here on my test world have you
ever<00:00:15.490> wanted<00:00:15.910> two<00:00:16.150> levers<00:00:16.660> can<00:00:17.350> control<00:00:17.710> one

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
ever wanted two levers can control one

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.030 
ever wanted two levers can control one
output<00:00:18.990> without<00:00:19.990> interfering<00:00:20.890> with<00:00:20.920> each

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
output without interfering with each

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.810 
output without interfering with each
other<00:00:21.360> you<00:00:22.360> can<00:00:22.540> see<00:00:22.720> here<00:00:22.930> my<00:00:23.080> quick<00:00:23.320> demo

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
other you can see here my quick demo

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970 
other you can see here my quick demo
both<00:00:24.820> levers<00:00:25.150> will<00:00:25.570> control<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.170> output<00:00:26.320> but

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
both levers will control the output but

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.249 
both levers will control the output but
if<00:00:27.070> you<00:00:27.220> leave<00:00:27.400> one<00:00:27.759> lever<00:00:28.060> on<00:00:28.329> it<00:00:28.630> totally

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
if you leave one lever on it totally

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.100 
if you leave one lever on it totally
makes<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.529> other<00:00:29.710> one<00:00:29.860> useless<00:00:31.110> that's

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
makes the other one useless that's

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
makes the other one useless that's
because<00:00:32.500> power<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:32.950> stuck<00:00:33.579> in<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.820> line<00:00:34.030> here

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
because power is stuck in the line here

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.950 
because power is stuck in the line here
so<00:00:36.460> we're<00:00:36.640> going<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.820> wire<00:00:37.059> up<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.420> compact

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
so we're going to wire up a compact

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.270 
so we're going to wire up a compact
piston<00:00:38.500> version<00:00:38.950> of<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.640> xor<00:00:40.270> gate<00:00:41.250> lay<00:00:42.250> a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
piston version of the xor gate lay a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.279 
piston version of the xor gate lay a
block<00:00:42.640> down<00:00:42.850> with<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.090> redstone<00:00:43.480> torch<00:00:43.750> on<00:00:44.199> the

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
block down with a redstone torch on the

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.400 
block down with a redstone torch on the
side<00:00:45.000> coming<00:00:46.000> from<00:00:46.239> that<00:00:46.300> block<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.929> lay<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
side coming from that block you lay a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.799 
side coming from that block you lay a
repeater<00:00:48.100> with<00:00:48.429> another<00:00:48.760> repeater<00:00:49.179> beside<00:00:49.600> it

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
repeater with another repeater beside it

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.579 
repeater with another repeater beside it
let's<00:00:50.739> actually<00:00:50.980> attach<00:00:51.399> this<00:00:51.699> torch<00:00:52.589> piece

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
let's actually attach this torch piece

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.310 
let's actually attach this torch piece
of<00:00:53.800> dust<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.609> dust<00:00:54.969> attaches<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.839> sticky

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
of dust this dust attaches to a sticky

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.549 
of dust this dust attaches to a sticky
piston<00:00:56.530> on<00:00:56.920> its<00:00:57.190> side<00:00:57.839> with<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.870> block<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.530> front

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
piston on its side with a block in front

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.419 
piston on its side with a block in front
of<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.890> other<00:01:02.920> side<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.309> this

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
of it now on the other side of this

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.710 
of it now on the other side of this
block<00:01:03.789> you're<00:01:03.999> going<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.180> lay<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.360> line<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.900> dust

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.650 

yeah<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.620> basically<00:01:10.310> if<00:01:10.940> this<00:01:11.120> block<00:01:11.450> was

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
yeah and basically if this block was

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.350 
yeah and basically if this block was
over<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.230> space<00:01:12.530> here<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.880> repeater

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
over in the space here this repeater

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.980 
over in the space here this repeater
will<00:01:14.630> also<00:01:14.900> attach<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.500> dust<00:01:16.480> this<00:01:17.480> is<00:01:17.780> our

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
will also attach the dust this is our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.850 
will also attach the dust this is our
output<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:19.610> try<00:01:20.000> not<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.360> bend<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.750> like<00:01:21.020> that

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
output so try not to bend it like that

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.130 
output so try not to bend it like that
even<00:01:22.790> though<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.880> haven't<00:01:23.120> tested<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.840> wouldn't

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
even though I haven't tested I wouldn't

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.720 
even though I haven't tested I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:24.680> break<00:01:24.980> off<00:01:25.130> your<00:01:25.160> output<00:01:25.640> an

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
suggest it break off your output an

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.410 
suggest it break off your output an
extra<00:01:26.060> block<00:01:26.300> or<00:01:26.510> maybe<00:01:26.660> used<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.110> repeater<00:01:27.500> and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
extra block or maybe used a repeater and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200 
extra block or maybe used a repeater and
these<00:01:29.420> two<00:01:29.690> spots<00:01:30.020> here<00:01:30.350> are<00:01:30.590> also<00:01:30.830> are<00:01:31.460> your

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
these two spots here are also are your

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.950 
these two spots here are also are your
input<00:01:33.790> now<00:01:34.790> if<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.030> want<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.300> drag<00:01:35.510> your<00:01:35.630> input

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
input now if you want to drag your input

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.360 
input now if you want to drag your input
a<00:01:35.990> little<00:01:36.230> bit<00:01:36.320> further<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:36.980> add<00:01:37.340> a

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
a little bit further you can add a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.250 
a little bit further you can add a
repeater<00:01:38.150> here<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.780> doesn't<00:01:39.110> interfere

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
repeater here so it doesn't interfere

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.280 
repeater here so it doesn't interfere
with<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.890> torch<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.780> drag<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:41.930> out<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.050> little

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
with this torch and drag it out a little

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.920 
with this torch and drag it out a little
bit<00:01:42.440> further<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:43.100> as<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.330> side<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.600> can

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
bit further and as for this side you can

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.530 
bit further and as for this side you can
just<00:01:45.170> basically<00:01:45.380> attach<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.640> right<00:01:46.790> into<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
just basically attach it right into the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.610 
just basically attach it right into the
block<00:01:47.860> like<00:01:48.860> so

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.820 

but<00:01:52.250> that's<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.880> compact<00:01:53.450> piston<00:01:54.020> version<00:01:54.620> of

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
but that's the compact piston version of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.130 
but that's the compact piston version of
the<00:01:55.040> xor<00:01:55.580> gate<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.230> can<00:01:57.470> see<00:01:57.710> both<00:01:58.010> levers

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the xor gate now you can see both levers

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.810 
the xor gate now you can see both levers
will<00:02:00.140> control<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:01.900> piston<00:02:03.640> regardless<00:02:04.640> of

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
will control the piston regardless of

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.520 
will control the piston regardless of
what<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.120> other<00:02:05.270> Lieber<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:06.140> doing<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.960> very

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
what the other Lieber is doing so very

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.940 
what the other Lieber is doing so very
useful<00:02:11.080> basically<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.410> go<00:02:12.620> ahead<00:02:12.740> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
useful basically you can go ahead and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.290 
useful basically you can go ahead and
wire<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.460> some<00:02:13.490> indicator<00:02:14.240> torches<00:02:16.300> coming

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
wire up some indicator torches coming

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380 
wire up some indicator torches coming
from<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.690> line<00:02:17.990> here<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:19.640> these<00:02:19.850> levers<00:02:20.240> that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
from this line here to these levers that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.480 
from this line here to these levers that
will<00:02:20.840> indicate<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.320> true<00:02:21.590> value<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.310> in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
will indicate the true value if it's in

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.190 
will indicate the true value if it's in
the<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:23.180> off<00:02:23.420> state<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.140> is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
the on or off state so there it is

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.500 
the on or off state so there it is
compact<00:02:27.800> version<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.490> xor<00:02:28.880> gate<00:02:28.910> rate

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
