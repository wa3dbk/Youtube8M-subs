00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.280
Hello, this is Teryi.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.340
Good evening, it is slow.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.600
Thank you for your viewing.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.040
I Thank you.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.840
Well the last time, it is as far as it defeated the fate of only the mercy.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.100
Well, I wonder if that matches well.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.240
Well, first I will aim the items recovered.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.060
Even so, I'm not young monster this passage.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.720
It 's thoughtless should not Waka.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.940
The probability that the springs are in the area you do not have any crush springing,
Because it is equivalent to the trap tower there is only 10 blocks square.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.220
I see.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.740
Well came back.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.600
Because was 132 seconds, the length of the far it is about 570 blocks.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.800
The food to enter the hand you were a zombie hmm.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.020
To have been waiting to order Wow.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.201
Koikoi.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.680
Well wonder no good.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.880
Oh shit.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.480
What is it?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.620
Oh oh wow

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.300
Reach You're a sweet.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120
Oh Aa. Now, I'm do not have gravel.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.880
You looking for.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.940
I'll be lost item Once you have relaxed.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.479
It is not that is the only place like this. But is disgusting.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.059
It probably safe if you do not let go of the shift key.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.840
I supposed that, but I often experience falling into lava for some reason.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.100
Well I will rush.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.400
Are you still yeah yeah?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300
Cho, It's not over there.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.840
How can I calm down?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.220
I Uwaabu. Soil block is was one of the last.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.740
Well, I also happen to items lost when I was unemployed.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.240
I called your fellow rough.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.060
That one? But a good feeling.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.260
Come to think of it, the damage of arrows You're a little while ago was small.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.560
It seems less damage to fire mode.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.260
What? Surely

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.560
Oh the crust, it's a weapon. Weapon.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.850
About 5 hours had passed from the world generation, I got a weapon for the first time.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.480
I though there is no arrow only three shots worth.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.660
Oh, Is not no damage.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.720
Please see more. There are also eight different items.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.580
If only this, you feel like you do not die until another abandoned mine.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.940
We were thinking, but it was the play increased risk ever again.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.340
From now on, the main linear mining, I aspire a solid play.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.980
To say such a thing, it will only do not want to lose the bow got.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.620
I Phetchaburi Phetchaburi Chan Chan.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.260
It is Phetchaburi Phetchaburi Chan Chan.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.980
Was good. And I wanted to leave the area to find springing out slime.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.940
I'll be easy to make refractory Potion.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.960
I will rush good.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960
Was not a safety-oriented?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.920
I do not wonder, but it because you want to discover the abandoned mine.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.060
Oh yeah, I tried to calculate it found or if you find how much abandoned mine.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.960
Guess there are many, but it is a pretty decent number.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.920
In?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.929
Per dug 2000 block mining in a straight line is the average value.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.640
If it is decent luck, I seem to be found in the 700 block around.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.680
That means, I No such place I little by little if good luck.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.500
It's right.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.980
I also found the cave.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.080
If you think, It is a continuation of the cave of this slime.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.340
If you go digging further, I found lava.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.940
I mean you've found a diamond also, in.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.100
N do? What's the matter?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.920
When you are digging this stone, operation'm heavy for a moment something.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.520
If towards the bottom, each month, but I lost.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.520
Will it do a certain something in the direction of here?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, there was a cave, but I dig this more than it is very likely.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.920
I guess What was.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.400
I did not ask you there is a fortress unexpectedly.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.860
I've been digging quite since then.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.960
There was one place lava sea way, but I did not do anything.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.400
Well, it seems the cave of dark, but you can rush a little.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.320
I'm not at all light. Maybe a little scary.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.800
1 hour or more, I do not cave search just dig straight.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.420
Tension I will want once in a while.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.840
I What does it recover the motivation gauge.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.040
That one? The Kke'm from Which?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.460
Oh, but I was shining even stepped on me Red Stone.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.320
You get lost in one road is seen for the first time.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.420
No, but I think it must be a misunderstanding, the cave has been around.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.860
There was barely entrance.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.680
I also was spotted without the lava sea.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.780
You do not put soil. It is deep.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.040
Well, you can not drop the gravel from the ceiling, and I'd like to continue to fill safely,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.840
You only have one.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.860
Example, Cho?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.800
Yeah yeah Why? It does not release the shift key. I wonder bug.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.280
'm Not a bug.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.100
You mean, are not aware or what was left of the block now?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.200
Oh Yeah. It was good but if you have a gravel.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.380
Well, are you glad If you do not have a gravel.
