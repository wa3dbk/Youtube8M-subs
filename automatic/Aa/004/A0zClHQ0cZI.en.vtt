00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and you can see that it's the full shot

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.230 
and you can see that it's the full shot
and<00:00:22.410> pretty<00:00:23.340> much<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.090> with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and pretty much what you can do with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.860 
and pretty much what you can do with
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.890> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:25.920> hit<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.880> regular<00:00:27.360> or<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
this is you can hit it regular or you

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.510 
this is you can hit it regular or you
can<00:00:28.110> put<00:00:28.560> loft<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.280> or<00:00:29.640> put<00:00:29.670> low<00:00:30.600> loft<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
can put loft on it or put low loft on it

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
can put loft on it or put low loft on it
just<00:00:32.520> changes<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> trajectory<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.140> well

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
just changes a trajectory and as well

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.329 
just changes a trajectory and as well
you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.710> click<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.329> joystick<00:00:36.629> and

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
you can click in the right joystick and

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.340 
you can click in the right joystick and
you<00:00:38.339> can<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> half<00:00:39.149> choke<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> full<00:00:40.079> choke

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you can do a half choke and a full choke

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.619 
you can do a half choke and a full choke
and<00:00:41.039> that<00:00:41.249> takes<00:00:41.489> some<00:00:41.670> distance<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and that takes some distance off and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
and that takes some distance off and
lowers<00:00:43.109> the<00:00:43.230> trajectory<00:00:43.769> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.100> bit<00:00:44.300> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
lowers the trajectory a little bit so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
lowers the trajectory a little bit so
I'm<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.570> gonna<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.929> regular<00:00:46.170> swing<00:00:46.620> here

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and fast forward it and the next shot

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
and fast forward it and the next shot

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
gonna line it up here I see that I'm an

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.529 
gonna line it up here I see that I'm an
88%<00:01:25.380> uh<00:01:26.390> rough<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:29.149> just<00:01:30.149> want<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.450> ahead

and swing and roll it up there on the
green<00:01:35.719> pretty<00:01:36.719> easy<00:01:36.960> once<00:01:37.289> you<00:01:37.380> learn<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
green pretty easy once you learn how to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.050 
green pretty easy once you learn how to
do<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
pretty much lines up perfect for this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.700 
pretty much lines up perfect for this
situation<00:01:50.630> as<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> can

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710

the<00:02:02.159> pitch<00:02:02.340> shot<00:02:02.579> works<00:02:02.759> perfect<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the pitch shot works perfect here the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789 
the pitch shot works perfect here the
fourth<00:02:06.299> shot<00:02:06.539> I'm<00:02:06.749> going<00:02:06.929> to<00:02:07.020> talk<00:02:07.200> about<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
fourth shot I'm going to talk about is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.609 
fourth shot I'm going to talk about is
the<00:02:08.130> flop<00:02:08.369> shot<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.050> miss<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> green

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the flop shot so if you miss the green

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.030 
the flop shot so if you miss the green
and<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.520> bunker<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.270> way<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:13.409> any

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and you have a bunker in your way or any

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.570 
and you have a bunker in your way or any
obstacle<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> matter

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
obstacle for that matter

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.310 
obstacle for that matter
and<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.390> pitch<00:02:16.630> shot<00:02:16.900> might<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
and you think a pitch shot might be a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.410 
and you think a pitch shot might be a
little<00:02:17.440> risky<00:02:17.740> especially<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:18.790> Augusta<00:02:19.270> with

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
little risky especially at Augusta with

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.170 
little risky especially at Augusta with
the<00:02:19.540> ball<00:02:19.690> rolling<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> green<00:02:20.470> as<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.710> does

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the ball rolling on the green as it does

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.700 
the ball rolling on the green as it does
you<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.210> always<00:02:22.510> click<00:02:22.840> square<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.560> go<00:02:23.650> to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
you can always click square and go to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.400 
you can always click square and go to
the<00:02:23.890> flop<00:02:24.160> shot<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.480> ball<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.990> fly<00:02:26.380> a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the flop shot and the ball just fly a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.290 
the flop shot and the ball just fly a
little<00:02:26.740> bit<00:02:26.860> higher<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.430> land<00:02:27.670> softer<00:02:28.180> than

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
little bit higher and land softer than

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.120 
little bit higher and land softer than
with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.540> pitch<00:02:28.750> wood<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.350> that's<00:02:29.920> what<00:02:30.040> I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
with the pitch wood so that's what I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.180 
with the pitch wood so that's what I
chose<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.460> use<00:02:30.610> here<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:32.230> played<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.980> lie

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
chose to use here I just played the lie

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.880 
chose to use here I just played the lie
a<00:02:33.220> little<00:02:33.550> bit<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.050> hit<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> nice<00:02:35.290> flop<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.830> it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
a little bit and hit a nice flop and it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
a little bit and hit a nice flop and it
just<00:02:36.070> rolls<00:02:36.550> down<00:02:36.820> there<00:02:37.000> near<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.240> flagstick

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
just rolls down there near the flagstick

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.260 
just rolls down there near the flagstick
and<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.430> last<00:02:39.640> shot<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.120> talk

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and the last shot I'm going to talk

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.530 
and the last shot I'm going to talk
about<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> chip<00:02:40.930> shot<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:43.210> pretty

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
about is the chip shot and it pretty

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.120 
about is the chip shot and it pretty
much<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.500> low<00:02:45.000> roller<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.770> have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
much just is a low roller so I have

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.620
