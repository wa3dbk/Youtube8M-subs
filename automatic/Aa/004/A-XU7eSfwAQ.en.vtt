00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that's not even the half of it the very

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.540 
that's not even the half of it the very
best<00:00:21.900> feature<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:22.890> actually<00:00:23.100> get<00:00:23.430> it

for a fraction of what you'd expect to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:01:00.900 
for a fraction of what you'd expect to
pay<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.890> that's<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:27.300> used

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.869 

okay<00:01:01.910> use<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.140> bit<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.559> crude<00:01:04.010> term<00:01:04.519> here

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
okay use is a bit of a crude term here

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.540

instead<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.750> is<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.960> Porsche<00:01:06.650> certified

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
instead this is a Porsche certified

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.330 
instead this is a Porsche certified
pre-owned<00:01:08.479> car<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.619> exactly<00:01:10.040> what<00:01:10.190> does<00:01:10.280> that

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
pre-owned car so exactly what does that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460 
pre-owned car so exactly what does that
mean<00:01:10.760> well<00:01:11.270> essentially<00:01:11.900> it's<00:01:12.140> been<00:01:12.290> brought

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
mean well essentially it's been brought

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.920 
mean well essentially it's been brought
up<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> standard<00:01:13.460> higher<00:01:14.060> than<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.600> typical

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
up to a standard higher than a typical

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.560 
up to a standard higher than a typical
used<00:01:15.680> car<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.280> before<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:16.820> get<00:01:17.030> into<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.240> exact

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
used car and before I get into the exact

definition<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.740> think<00:01:18.950> it's<00:01:19.130> pretty

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
definition of that I think it's pretty

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.670 
definition of that I think it's pretty
obvious<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:20.150> by<00:01:20.240> looking<00:01:20.600> at<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:21.440> may<00:01:21.650> be

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
obvious just by looking at it it may be

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.670 
obvious just by looking at it it may be
a<00:01:21.800> 2010<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.090> paint<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.600> immaculate<00:01:24.440> I've
