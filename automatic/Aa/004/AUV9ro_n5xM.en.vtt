use<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> workbook<00:01:40.920> we've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.179> little

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
use the workbook we've got a little

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
use the workbook we've got a little
example<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> workbook<00:01:44.729> sheets

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
example here of what the workbook sheets

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
example here of what the workbook sheets
look<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> download<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
look like and when you download the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.559 
look like and when you download the
course<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.069> also<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> original<00:01:48.239> manual

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569
