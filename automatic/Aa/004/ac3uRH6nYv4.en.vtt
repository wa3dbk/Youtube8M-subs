00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
four or five times just to get across it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
four or five times just to get across it
up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.570> feel<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.140> should<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.350> at

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
up and I feel like there should be at

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
up and I feel like there should be at
one<00:01:13.619> point<00:01:13.890> where<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:14.280> pedestrians

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
one point where it's just pedestrians

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.080 
one point where it's just pedestrians
can<00:01:15.270> cross<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> minute

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
can cross for like a minute

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.249 
can cross for like a minute
just<00:01:17.359> go<00:01:17.479> all<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.780> way<00:01:17.810> through<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:18.200> you

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
just go all the way through and you

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.250 
just go all the way through and you
don't<00:01:18.409> have<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.679> have<00:01:18.710> it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
don't have to have it

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.500 
don't have to have it
now<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.920> major<00:01:21.130> issue<00:01:21.280> with<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.820> bridge<00:01:22.030> is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
now one major issue with the bridge is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.780 
now one major issue with the bridge is
where<00:01:22.780> Psychlo<00:01:23.260> should<00:01:23.440> ride<00:01:23.650> as<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.490> can<00:01:24.640> see

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
where Psychlo should ride as you can see

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.400 
where Psychlo should ride as you can see
there's<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.090> lot<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.240> heavy<00:01:25.450> traffic<00:01:25.810> behind<00:01:26.140> me

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
there's a lot of heavy traffic behind me

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.480 
there's a lot of heavy traffic behind me
and<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.820> lanes<00:01:28.030> are<00:01:28.180> very<00:01:28.420> narrow<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:30.340> now

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and the lanes are very narrow right now

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.940 
and the lanes are very narrow right now
there's<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.820> narrow<00:01:31.090> sidewalk<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:32.680> side<00:01:32.920> to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
there's a narrow sidewalk one side to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.340 
there's a narrow sidewalk one side to
the<00:01:33.100> other<00:01:33.160> some<00:01:33.910> cyclists<00:01:34.330> use<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.170> heavy

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
the other some cyclists use the heavy

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.170 
the other some cyclists use the heavy
pedestrian<00:01:35.620> traffic<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.730> doesn't<00:01:37.060> always

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
pedestrian traffic it doesn't always

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.780 
pedestrian traffic it doesn't always
make<00:01:37.420> sense<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.590> we're<00:01:38.740> hoping<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.100> when<00:01:39.370> GCR

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
make sense so we're hoping that when GCR

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.370 
make sense so we're hoping that when GCR
looks<00:01:40.210> at<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> bridge<00:01:40.630> they'll<00:01:41.140> consider

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
looks at the bridge they'll consider

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.290 
looks at the bridge they'll consider
putting<00:01:41.650> bike<00:01:41.920> lanes<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.430> roadway<00:01:42.790> so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
putting bike lanes on the roadway so

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.880 
putting bike lanes on the roadway so
that<00:01:43.450> bicycles<00:01:43.900> have<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.080> safe<00:01:44.320> place<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.590> be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
that bicycles have a safe place to be

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.190 
that bicycles have a safe place to be
where<00:01:45.070> they<00:01:45.160> feel<00:01:45.430> comfortable<00:01:46.200> definitely

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
where they feel comfortable definitely

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.720 
where they feel comfortable definitely
this<00:01:47.380> should<00:01:47.920> be<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:48.010> bike<00:01:48.250> lane<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.580> this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
this should be a bike lane on this

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.030 
this should be a bike lane on this
bridge<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.150> totally<00:01:49.540> hazardous<00:01:50.140> it's<00:01:50.830> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
bridge and totally hazardous it's the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.860 
bridge and totally hazardous it's the
most<00:01:51.220> hazardous<00:01:51.490> part<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.120> my<00:01:52.180> entire<00:01:52.479> trip

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
most hazardous part of my entire trip

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.780 
most hazardous part of my entire trip
over<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.229> couple<00:01:53.560> miles<00:01:53.740> it's<00:01:54.550> pretty

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
over a couple miles it's pretty

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
over a couple miles it's pretty
dangerous<00:01:55.200> iOS<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.350> hit<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:57.250> last<00:01:57.490> week's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
dangerous iOS is hit like last week's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.440 
dangerous iOS is hit like last week's
cards<00:01:59.380> don't<00:01:59.530> really<00:01:59.920> care<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:01.300> know

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
cards don't really care that you know

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.210 
cards don't really care that you know
you're<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.870> biker<00:02:02.200> there

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.950 

I<00:02:05.280> guess<00:02:05.880> it'd<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.480> see<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.840> we

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I guess it'd be really good to see if we

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.609 
I guess it'd be really good to see if we
had<00:02:07.050> by<00:02:07.260> claims<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.880> allow<00:02:09.470> bikers<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
