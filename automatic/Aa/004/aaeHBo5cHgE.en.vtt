00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.830
 will take the profit of the group 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.420
 and here we are going to cross the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 delays then this will come back very 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 often because you are stuck 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.449
 against the glass 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 finally the father spyeye earlier here you 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.300
 finally have you press the key 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.800
 before it's so you'll be here at last 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 you will be sticking against your your wall 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.040
 of staff and you launch it to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.930
 criminal alsace but you have to 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.950
 go to the blog but more to spain 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.990
 and here you are going to go then for 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 cross the green blog is the same 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.040
 you paste the launched by there he passed 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.869
 in front of the barriers still the same 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.200
 so see yes it's really all the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.649
 time the same almost the valley 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.610
 barrier still the same doors still 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:56.790
 the same you put you put there 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 still knows nothing 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.820
 then crossed a hatch placed becomes 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.690
 interesting it's herself and then avr 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.130
 put on the block adjacent to the hatch 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.190
 this is so yes why know that he 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 must it be on this block there because 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.380
 that otherwise it should not have me I have not 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 found how to do and me on the internet 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.270
 then you put nikki years on that edge 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 there franÃ§ois bloch next to what and you 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.330
 have launched to the the hatch all 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.070
 intense fuck in advance finally one year 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.000
 you do not advance you put like this 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.250
 on his blog 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 announce your child m here you are 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.300
 go ahead so it went as if 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.120
 plus there was nothing at all then in 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.260
 our example if he applauds a faction 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.690
 exclaimed that pop 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 that's it for doors not so there is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.440
 choices for you for through simple 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.190
 or you put first choice you 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.620
 put for him that's the angle here you 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:10.260
 have passed very simply second 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.440
 way you move bala you're not 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.440
 only 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.960
 to do 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.610
 so 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.670
 the iem way now I was going for 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.280
 pass a wall you go for mac like 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.230
 this one in relation to the wall and you 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 go what is often called hungry either 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.069
 well below that compared to you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.290
 look and saab and it'll go round 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.370
 the page of this technique what we 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.620
 could pass for example a wall and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.980
 if there is lava and you can 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.459
 not take the risk of running it low 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 alas are you not wet 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.790
 either you sing or you get started 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.349
 a gold mine lose like that then 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 now the goal is going to get you into 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.239
 a base for example in auxiliaries the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.450
 night so to do that you go 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.739
 aim to do this you secretly block 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.359
 and when you wished you have 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.260
 a week of falling back well knew that 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.269
 I was going to China I was there you take 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:22.829
 downstairs and Norman they lead their father 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.829
 will arrive I have no impression 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.930
 here we are and so here I am 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.250
 in micro usb 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.460
 good faith for new tutorials 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.460
