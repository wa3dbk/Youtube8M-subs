this<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> fun<00:02:06.460> thing<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:07.030> had<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.780> use<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> tool

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
this is a fun thing I had to use a tool

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.960 
this is a fun thing I had to use a tool
I<00:02:08.649> bought<00:02:09.009> years<00:02:09.369> ago<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.750> post<00:02:11.050> level<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
I bought years ago it's a post level and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.620 
I bought years ago it's a post level and
this<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> be<00:02:13.780> part<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.440> handrail

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
this is going to be part of the handrail

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.060 
this is going to be part of the handrail
but<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.709> let<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.070> level<00:02:18.489> both<00:02:19.060> ways<00:02:20.070> of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
but it will let you level both ways of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.459 
but it will let you level both ways of
fun
