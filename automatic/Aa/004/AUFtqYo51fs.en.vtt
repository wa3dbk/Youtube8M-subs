00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.170
 there are the guys it's the customer getting 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.599
 find today for a whole 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250
 new video episode 2 of loki 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.110
 versus so I had done the first on 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.789
 titeuf falls and let's say a little 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.770
 quiet series when there is a game that 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.029
 I like it or not where I have 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.400
 something to say that just came out 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.849
 or who can who is likely to 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.929
 to interest 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.360
 I'm doing a little video I give my 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.920
 notice so today trial fusion the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.589
 friends this is the game I was waiting for the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.629
 more at the beginning of the year because that's it 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.970
 it's really a game I liked 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.900
 with trials evolution so the first 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.210
 I played 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.730
 and then here trial fusion is out so 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.010
 the 15th in the United States seems to me 16 in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.239
 France then for those who would like 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.379
 to know the price it is true that the estrie 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.850
 meyer there are many who tell me 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.949
 asked he is priced at 20 euros he 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.020
 seems to me but I bought them in cd 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.910
 so in the cd you have a bonus you 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.039
 have the season pass so throughout 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.050
 the year you are going to have so dlc and that's 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.039
 at the price of 40 euros so that's 40 euros 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.539
 with the dlc 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.110
 when you see games like call of 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.550
 which costs 70 euros and dlc to 50 euros 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.840
 you see the thing so I agree 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.090
 that it's not at all the same style of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.460
 game it's not so complete maybe 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.380
 it's really our universe but for 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.939
 a game like that it's really cheap 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.119
 and it's worth what it's really worth 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.460
 stroke 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.200
 so the publisher is ubisoft for those 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.439
 who would want to know the developer and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.659
 links so in the den of the motorcycle game 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.759
 you have on the screen different routes 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.619
 so you have quad you have 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.229
 surely freestyle you have some 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.820
 basic races that I will propose to you 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.950
 and so here is my opinion on this game 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 it's really a fucking game guys 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.470
 do not hesitate to buy it if you can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.580
 really the levels are well dosed the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.050
 difficulty is well dosed so 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.510
 what do I mean by that is 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.090
 true that a game is good in general or 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.850
 not or he rather played on a long term 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.520
 by a player who does not get tired but 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.710
 who sees there must yi all the time 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.510
 a little a little want to go 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.310
 always further is really in 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 trials you have easy levels or 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 there you feel to manage and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.710
 levels more difficult but even if 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 it's difficult you always go from one 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.640
 precious to be able to succeed and that's it 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.780
 which is good is that the player does not 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.240
 not tired because it's too easy 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 but he is not too fed up 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.730
 because it's too hard 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.810
 see what I mean there is all the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.450
 time printing for can get there 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.310
 we are constantly trying to get there and if 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.450
 what makes this game great and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.070
 great simply because we 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.550
 start again and again we do not see the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.000
 time pass 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.740
 we want to get there afterwards if I can 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.990
 to tell you about the decors of quality 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.030
 graph is nothing to say guys for 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.530
 a game where you just have a track to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.300
 track where you can not go other 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 apart you have an environment that is 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
 just outstanding because you have 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.100
 for example a game the fps like 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.780
 battlefield call of you move 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.130
 in the map you can go around the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.140
 bush and so on see how that's 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.360
 made the announcement a decor that has in some 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.040
 kind of fixed enough even if there is 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 many animations that make super 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.430
 pleasure frankly you guys have 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.780
 tracks where where the track can be 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.430
 just move stack when you 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.290
 do you get any interactions from 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 scenery light it's really silly 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.560
 and at the graphic level even though it's 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 something that does not necessarily move 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 make it super applied you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.350
 can see scenery in the distance that are 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.150
 even work and that's frankly there 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.380
 where it makes the difference because for 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.520
 a little game like that have a quality 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.610
 graphic 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.870
 of this quality it's just ouf me 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.940
 personally I on xbox one our 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.860
 720 customers who are on site because 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.800
 it seemed to me in 1080 it must be 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.020
 even more beautiful here after you have 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.520
 a lot of things that do not bring more 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380
 top I can customize your 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.940
 motorcycles your characters or as you go 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.590
 of the game you unlock new bikes 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.300
 that you can customize differently 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.880
 fairings of different wheels 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.620
 colors you can really do 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.140
 many things you even have in 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.580
 racing challenges by race and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.930
 that's really where it is 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.820
 you're still in the game 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.890
 what I love is that to get 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.390
 relax you can go on trials and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.560
 to make the pair you can go 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.510
 on trials because it's really a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.270
 game where you can have fun is 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 relaxed doing what you want here 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.510
 to please you quietly and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.610
 you can also play the medals 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.750
 of gold play the records you have all the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.070
 record time to beat because 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.330
 you will not be directly prime 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.190
 world it's impossible 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.720
 and you have all the time records to 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.610
 beat you can give you challenges 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.530
 yourself or very well do not you in 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.480
 give and yet the game remains the same 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.010
 that's what it is or what it is 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.470
 who does that trial is really for everything 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.690
 the world for everyone not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.370
 frankly it's a style of play that 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.660
 fits a lot of people 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.240
 could very well as I told you 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.970
 have fun or play the records the perf 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.530
 you have bikes that are great you 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.780
 have tracks they are beautiful 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.760
 different themes different worlds and 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.620
 that's where you really say that the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.180
 game is super good for the price 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.400
 because frankly for 20 euros 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.630
 have a game like this after 40 euros if 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.340
 you want the tfc of course but for 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.870
 valero have a game of a quality like 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.820
 it's not every day 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.410
 and then here is so if I have a 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.000
 advice the video is pretty short the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.770
 guys because frankly there is that of 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.510
 well for now if I have any 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.800
 remarks to make or what I will do to you 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.000
 way videos about this game in 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.470
 hoping that low and you 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.220
 do not look at what it's really game 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.139
 which is worth it 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.430
 and then here I am, thank you to all the people 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.080
 which opens a little because it's true 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.060
 there is at streamed and there was when 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.229
 even 30 35 people so for trial 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.060
 It makes me really happy 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.010
 this is unfair on which do 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.320
 a lot of fun I hope for 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.520
 those who have it is the same and then 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 here I am, I tell you next time 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.449
 you will have trial on my channel if I 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.789
 could give him a note that would 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.770
 a great note we will say 18 out of 20 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.360
 because frankly it's 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.990
 really the top after we will see the dlc 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.400
 what they are worth 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.050
 but it's a game that's great 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.970
 worked there all the time the new 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.500
 to do and then that's me I tell you to 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.000
 the next site and loki do not forget 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.780
 the little live I tell you next time 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.780
 on the guys
