if you don't have a food processor you
can<00:00:35.880> mix<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.750> bowl<00:00:38.690> then<00:00:39.690> we're

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
can mix them up in a bowl then we're

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.010 
can mix them up in a bowl then we're
going<00:00:40.080> to<00:00:40.140> sift<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.530> ingredients<00:00:41.190> together

mixture<00:01:03.449> starts<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.900> thicken<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
mixture starts to thicken we're going to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.219 
mixture starts to thicken we're going to
gradually<00:01:05.010> add<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:05.700> castor<00:01:06.270> sugar<00:01:06.560> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
then we're going to continue to mix

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
then we're going to continue to mix
until<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.000> forms<00:01:12.330> soft<00:01:12.630> white<00:01:13.140> peaks<00:01:13.650> add<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.870> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
until it forms soft white peaks add in a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.680 
until it forms soft white peaks add in a
drop<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.229> vanilla<00:01:16.710> extract<00:01:17.240> then<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.420> time

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
drop of vanilla extract then it's time

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.570 
drop of vanilla extract then it's time
to<00:01:18.900> add<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> coloring<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.830> using<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.310> paste

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to add the coloring I'm using a paste

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.960 
to add the coloring I'm using a paste
and<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.120> powder<00:01:21.950> now<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.310> does<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.729> long

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and a powder now a little does go a long

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.149 
and a powder now a little does go a long
way<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.210> obviously<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.259> add<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.649> much<00:01:25.829> as<00:01:26.039> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
way so obviously just add as much as you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.050 
way so obviously just add as much as you
need<00:01:26.310> until<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.969> your<00:01:27.119> desired<00:01:27.180> color

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
need until you get your desired color

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
need until you get your desired color
give<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.360> final<00:01:30.390> quick<00:01:31.079> mix<00:01:31.320> until<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
give it one final quick mix until that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920 
give it one final quick mix until that
color<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.310> incorporated<00:01:33.030> through<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
color is incorporated through and you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
color is incorporated through and you
come<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.649> beautiful<00:01:35.219> glossy

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
gently fold it through now you don't

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
gently fold it through now you don't
want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.359> under<00:01:48.750> mix<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.380> over<00:01:49.920> mix<00:01:50.130> this

stream then we just need to put our
mixture<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.969> piping<00:02:06.240> bag<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.320> ready

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
mixture into a piping bag so we're ready

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
mixture into a piping bag so we're ready
to<00:02:07.710> pipe<00:02:07.890> them<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> all<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:09.810> left<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to pipe them out and all that's left to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
to pipe them out and all that's left to
do<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.289> pipe<00:02:10.740> them<00:02:10.950> onto<00:02:11.340> our<00:02:11.460> tray<00:02:11.730> line<00:02:11.970> with

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
do is pipe them onto our tray line with

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.480 
do is pipe them onto our tray line with
baking<00:02:12.540> paper<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.410> try<00:02:13.740> not<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.400> a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
baking paper now try not to do it in a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.490 
baking paper now try not to do it in a
circular<00:02:14.760> motion<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.840> creates<00:02:16.200> air

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
circular motion because it creates air

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.210 
circular motion because it creates air
pockets<00:02:18.080> then<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.260> need<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.650> give<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> tray<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
pockets then we need to give the tray a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580 
pockets then we need to give the tray a
couple<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.700> hard<00:02:20.910> taps<00:02:21.240> turning<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.080> doing<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
couple of hard taps turning and doing it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.030 
couple of hard taps turning and doing it
again<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.960> also<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.530> tilt<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> tray

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
again I also like to tilt the tray

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.370 
again I also like to tilt the tray
slightly<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.270> fine<00:02:27.720> rounded

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
slightly just to get that fine rounded

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.920 
slightly just to get that fine rounded
form<00:02:28.850> then<00:02:29.850> we're<00:02:30.060> gonna<00:02:30.150> let<00:02:30.360> them<00:02:30.510> sit<00:02:30.750> for

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
form then we're gonna let them sit for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.300 
form then we're gonna let them sit for
about<00:02:31.020> 30<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.680> 40<00:02:32.010> minutes

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
about 30 to 40 minutes

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.350 
about 30 to 40 minutes
then<00:02:34.310> we're<00:02:34.550> going<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> pop<00:02:34.880> them<00:02:35.060> into<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
then we're going to pop them into the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.010 
then we're going to pop them into the
oven<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.840> about<00:02:35.930> 10<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.470> 12<00:02:36.710> minutes<00:02:37.780> once<00:02:38.780> out

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
of the oven the outer shell should be

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
of the oven the outer shell should be
nice<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.820> hard<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.870> bottom<00:02:42.200> should<00:02:42.410> come

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
nice and hard and the bottom should come

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.440 
nice and hard and the bottom should come
away<00:02:42.800> clean<00:02:43.280> from<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.610> baking<00:02:44.030> paper<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:46.450> make
