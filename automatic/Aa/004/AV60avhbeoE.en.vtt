welcome to a quick tips video for cinema
4d<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.130> After<00:00:14.910> Effects<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.859> just<00:00:16.859> making

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
4d and After Effects I'm just making

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.730 
4d and After Effects I'm just making
this<00:00:17.310> based<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.359> an<00:00:18.480> old<00:00:18.750> comment<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> saw

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this based on an old comment which I saw

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
this based on an old comment which I saw
a<00:00:19.770> while<00:00:20.070> back<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.730> somebody<00:00:21.330> had<00:00:21.539> asked<00:00:21.840> me

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
a while back and somebody had asked me

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.870 
a while back and somebody had asked me
how<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.800> light<00:00:23.369> flickers<00:00:24.199> animations

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
how I do this light flickers animations

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.080 
how I do this light flickers animations
this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.180> example<00:00:28.279> as<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> see<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
this is an example as you can see the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.780 
this is an example as you can see the
just<00:00:30.390> sort<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> turn<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.260> by<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
just sort of turn on one by one and this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
just sort of turn on one by one and this
is<00:00:32.850> actually<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.750> very<00:00:33.989> simple<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is actually very very simple and I'm

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.380 
is actually very very simple and I'm
actually<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> show<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.700> only<00:00:36.059> how<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
actually going to show you only how to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
actually going to show you only how to
do<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> cinema<00:00:37.680> 4d

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
do it in cinema 4d

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.690 
do it in cinema 4d
but<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> aspects<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> techniques<00:00:41.520> are

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but the aspects and techniques are

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
but the aspects and techniques are
exactly<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:43.579> After<00:00:44.579> Effects<00:00:45.110> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
exactly the same for After Effects so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.040 
exactly the same for After Effects so
I'm<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.149> spline<00:00:48.480> text<00:00:48.930> here

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I'm gonna go to the spline text here

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.569 
I'm gonna go to the spline text here
let's<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> quick<00:00:50.690> comp<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> drop

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
let's just make a quick comp so drop

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
let's just make a quick comp so drop
that<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:53.940> extrude<00:00:54.270> NURBS<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.719> just

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that into an extrude NURBS I'm just

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.729 
that into an extrude NURBS I'm just
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> tap<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.440> Flickr<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.469> then<00:00:58.469> I'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
going to tap into Flickr and then I'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.270 
going to tap into Flickr and then I'll
duplicate<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.879> spline<00:01:00.180> text<00:01:00.920> get<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> circle

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
duplicate the spline text get a circle

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.620 
duplicate the spline text get a circle
give<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> radius<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> maybe<00:01:03.989> two<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
give it a radius of maybe two or so and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.570 
give it a radius of maybe two or so and
then<00:01:06.630> drop<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.159> slip<00:01:09.150> nerves

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
then drop these into a slip nerves

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.500 
then drop these into a slip nerves
so<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> room<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> front<00:01:13.110> here

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
so we have like a room at the front here

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.860 
so we have like a room at the front here
like<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.540> lip<00:01:16.810> okay<00:01:17.470> uh<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:19.390> going<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.630> decrease

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
like a lip okay uh I'm going to decrease

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.530 
like a lip okay uh I'm going to decrease
the<00:01:20.200> radius<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.220> circle<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:21.880> one<00:01:22.300> or

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
the radius of the circle to like one or

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.530 
the radius of the circle to like one or
something<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.590> then<00:01:24.220> imagine<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:25.000> know<00:01:25.120> this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
something and then imagine you know this

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.180 
something and then imagine you know this
is<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.690> lot<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.930> Commons<00:01:26.320> animation<00:01:26.830> effects

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
is a lot of Commons animation effects

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.890 
is a lot of Commons animation effects
whatever<00:01:27.550> but<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.210> really<00:01:28.360> isn't<00:01:28.600> right

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
whatever but there really isn't right

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.590 
whatever but there really isn't right
now<00:01:29.080> but<00:01:29.620> it's<00:01:30.130> enough<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.520> show<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.060> effect

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
now but it's enough to show the effect

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.770 
now but it's enough to show the effect
if<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.140> go<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.850> luminance<00:01:34.240> channel<00:01:34.330> I'm

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
if I go to the luminance channel I'm

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.480 
if I go to the luminance channel I'm
going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.050> put<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.890> drop<00:01:36.369> this

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
going to put that on and drop this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.300 
going to put that on and drop this
material<00:01:37.380> onto<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:40.510> sweepnurbs<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.040> there's

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
material onto the sweepnurbs so there's

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.890 
material onto the sweepnurbs so there's
actually<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.610> bunch<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.030> ways<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.630> which<00:01:43.660> you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
actually a bunch of ways in which you

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.350 
actually a bunch of ways in which you
can<00:01:44.020> try<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.910> just<00:01:46.090> depends

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
can try to do this and it just depends

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.030 
can try to do this and it just depends
on<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.570> situation<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:47.410> one<00:01:47.649> which<00:01:47.860> will

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
on the situation but one which will

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.420 
on the situation but one which will
always<00:01:48.340> work<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:49.080> if<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.290> animate<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
always work is if you animate the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.780 
always work is if you animate the
visibility<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:52.300> this<00:01:53.080> layer<00:01:53.550> using<00:01:54.550> the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
visibility of this layer using the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.310 
visibility of this layer using the
display<00:01:55.240> tag<00:01:55.540> in<00:01:56.100> c4d<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.970> if<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.600> right-click<00:01:58.869> I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
display tag in c4d so if I right-click I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.969 
display tag in c4d so if I right-click I
can<00:01:59.670> go<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.729> cinema<00:02:01.060> 4d<00:02:01.360> tags<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.080> display

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
can go to cinema 4d tags and display

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.710 
can go to cinema 4d tags and display
tank<00:02:03.520> right<00:02:03.880> here<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.060> go<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.540> ten

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
tank right here and if you go to the ten

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.030 
tank right here and if you go to the ten
properties<00:02:07.960> you're<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.770> where<00:02:08.920> it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
properties you're going to see where it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.729 
properties you're going to see where it
says<00:02:09.280> visibility<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:10.959> we're<00:02:11.260> actually<00:02:11.440> not

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
says visibility now we're actually not

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.060 
says visibility now we're actually not
going<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.070> animate<00:02:12.459> 100%<00:02:13.300> or<00:02:13.510> 0%<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.950> can

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
going to animate 100% or 0% as you can

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.610 
going to animate 100% or 0% as you can
see<00:02:15.220> when<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.400> tip<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> Box<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.930> adjust<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
see when I tip the Box I can adjust the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.940 
see when I tip the Box I can adjust the
visibility<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.000> when<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.450> hit<00:02:19.600> render

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
visibility of this and when I hit render

visibility of this and when I hit render
you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.100> see<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:22.630> percent<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:23.110> can

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
you can see that at two percent we can

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.800 
you can see that at two percent we can
barely<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.799> anything<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.180> forty<00:02:25.540> seven

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
though it's almost there anyway so we're

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.940

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
going to do is to set this to zero so

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800 
going to do is to set this to zero so
right<00:02:38.709> now<00:02:38.950> there's<00:02:39.280> nothing<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.180> what

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
we're actually going to animate is the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.550 
we're actually going to animate is the
use<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.380> visibility<00:02:44.739> function<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.549> 0%<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
use of the visibility function at 0% so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
use of the visibility function at 0% so
we're<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.430> animate<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.940> being<00:02:49.239> either

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
we're going to animate this being either

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.289 
we're going to animate this being either
switched<00:02:50.140> off<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.739> switched<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.480> okay<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:54.299> and

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
switched off or switched on okay so and

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.000 
switched off or switched on okay so and
actually<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:56.730> reproduces<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> vice-versa

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.010 

can<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.069> say<00:03:02.250> result<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.900> is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
can I say result if this is on this is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.110 
can I say result if this is on this is
off<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.920> off<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
off and if this is off this is on this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.580 
off and if this is off this is on this
is<00:03:06.270> because<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.989> min0<00:03:07.650> off<00:03:08.280> means<00:03:08.819> 100%<00:03:09.590> okay

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
is because on min0 off means 100% okay

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.830 
is because on min0 off means 100% okay
so<00:03:10.830> enough<00:03:11.730> rambling<00:03:12.660> let's<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.739> this

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
so enough rambling let's just do this

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.309 
so enough rambling let's just do this
my<00:03:15.840> project<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.590> at<00:03:16.920> 30fps<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.510> every<00:03:19.110> time<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
my project is at 30fps and every time I

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.930 
my project is at 30fps and every time I
do<00:03:19.500> flick<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.069> animations<00:03:20.550> at<00:03:20.819> 30fps<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:23.310> will

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
do flick on animations at 30fps I will

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
do flick on animations at 30fps I will
set<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> keyframe<00:03:24.660> every<00:03:25.350> two<00:03:25.560> frames

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
set a keyframe every two frames

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.460 
set a keyframe every two frames
however<00:03:26.580> when<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.910> 24<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.780> making<00:03:28.319> on

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
however when I'm at 24 I'm making on

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.120 
however when I'm at 24 I'm making on
this<00:03:28.800> set<00:03:29.150> every<00:03:30.150> other<00:03:30.750> every<00:03:31.170> every<00:03:31.890> frame

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
this set every other every every frame

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.059 
this set every other every every frame
so<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:32.850> two<00:03:33.120> three<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.390> four<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.470> depends

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
so one two three and four but it depends

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.210 
so one two three and four but it depends
on<00:03:35.160> how<00:03:35.700> fast<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.239> want<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.630> play<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.950> on

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
on how fast you want this to play so on

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.870 
on how fast you want this to play so on
now<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.519> display<00:03:38.940> tank<00:03:39.239> let's<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.440> frame<00:03:41.130> ten

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
now I display tank let's go to frame ten

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.390 
now I display tank let's go to frame ten
and<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:45.420> are<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.140> set<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.650> keyframe<00:03:46.920> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and we are going to set a keyframe so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.610 
and we are going to set a keyframe so
hold<00:03:48.090> controlling<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.870> circle<00:03:49.290> next<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
hold controlling the circle next to the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.300 
hold controlling the circle next to the
word<00:03:49.830> use<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.610> line<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.030> visibility<00:03:51.450> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
word use in line with visibility and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.860 
word use in line with visibility and
then<00:03:53.310> we're<00:03:53.489> gonna<00:03:53.580> go<00:03:53.880> one<00:03:54.510> frame<00:03:54.750> forward

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
then we're gonna go one frame forward

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.180 
then we're gonna go one frame forward
and<00:03:55.620> let's<00:03:56.489> turn<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.330> off<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.860> then<00:03:58.860> set<00:03:59.160> a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
and let's turn that off and then set a

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.120 
and let's turn that off and then set a
keyframe<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.450> we've<00:04:01.140> just<00:04:01.380> set<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.560> keyframe<00:04:01.799> of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
keyframe so we've just set a keyframe of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.479 
keyframe so we've just set a keyframe of
this<00:04:02.340> just<00:04:02.970> flickering<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.959> one<00:04:04.230> hit<00:04:04.680> I'm

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
this just flickering on in one hit I'm

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.420 
this just flickering on in one hit I'm
going<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:05.970> advance<00:04:06.299> two<00:04:06.930> frames<00:04:07.320> sorry<00:04:07.799> eleven

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
going to advance two frames sorry eleven

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.220 
going to advance two frames sorry eleven
right<00:04:08.549> now<00:04:08.760> let's<00:04:09.060> go<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.269> 13

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
right now let's go to 13

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.580 
right now let's go to 13
and<00:04:10.519> let's<00:04:11.519> set<00:04:12.209> another<00:04:12.510> keyframe<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:13.200> fact

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
and let's set another keyframe in fact

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.580 
and let's set another keyframe in fact
we<00:04:14.430> need<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.640> set<00:04:14.880> another<00:04:14.970> keyframe<00:04:15.390> at<00:04:15.840> 12

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
we need to set another keyframe at 12

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.039 
we need to set another keyframe at 12
and<00:04:17.010> then<00:04:17.850> at<00:04:17.970> 13<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.200> where<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:19.789> whoops

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
and then at 13 this is where we whoops

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.590 
and then at 13 this is where we whoops
that<00:04:22.049> was<00:04:22.200> not<00:04:22.560> 12<00:04:22.950> okay<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.060> 12<00:04:24.360> let's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
that was not 12 okay this is 12 let's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.580 
that was not 12 okay this is 12 let's
search<00:04:24.870> every<00:04:25.520> let's<00:04:26.520> go<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.789> 13<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.840> we're

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
search every let's go to 13 and we're

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.460 
search every let's go to 13 and we're
going<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.800> turn<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> visibility<00:04:29.669> again

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
going to turn on the visibility again

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.580 
going to turn on the visibility again
and<00:04:31.560> let's<00:04:32.520> say<00:04:33.020> advance<00:04:34.020> another<00:04:34.320> frame

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
and let's say advance another frame

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.860 
and let's say advance another frame
let's<00:04:35.340> insert<00:04:35.790> another<00:04:36.000> keyframe<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.780> then

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
let's insert another keyframe and then

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.640 
let's insert another keyframe and then
at<00:04:36.990> 15<00:04:37.640> we'll<00:04:38.640> turn<00:04:39.420> that<00:04:39.480> off<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.080> bring<00:04:40.500> it

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
at 15 we'll turn that off and bring it

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.760 
at 15 we'll turn that off and bring it
back<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:42.080> maybe<00:04:43.080> that's<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.410> little<00:04:43.590> confusing

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
back so maybe that's a little confusing

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.920 
back so maybe that's a little confusing
but<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.850> get<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> idea

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
but you get the idea

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.950 
but you get the idea
you<00:04:46.380> basically<00:04:46.590> just<00:04:46.980> going<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.190> animate<00:04:47.520> this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
you basically just going to animate this

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
you basically just going to animate this
in<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.050> way<00:04:49.140> which<00:04:49.350> looks<00:04:49.590> okay<00:04:50.160> for<00:04:50.220> the

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
in a way which looks okay for the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.280 
in a way which looks okay for the
animation<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.210> can<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:52.050> more

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
animation and you can actually do more

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.410 
animation and you can actually do more
flickers<00:04:52.770> than<00:04:52.980> just<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.460> double<00:04:54.030> flicker

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
flickers than just this double flicker

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
flickers than just this double flicker
which<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.410> use<00:04:55.650> most<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.670> time<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.200> that's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
which I use most of the time so that's

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.220 
which I use most of the time so that's
one<00:04:58.860> way<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.250> doing<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.970> another<00:05:00.720> way<00:05:00.900> might

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
one way of doing that another way might

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.480 
one way of doing that another way might
be<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.500> use<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.600> compositing<00:05:04.200> tag<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.740> then

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
be to use the compositing tag and then

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.230 
be to use the compositing tag and then
animate<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.060> scene<00:05:06.390> by<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> camera<00:05:07.110> option<00:05:08.240> but

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
animate the scene by a camera option but

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.080 
animate the scene by a camera option but
I<00:05:09.270> find<00:05:09.510> what<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:09.900> is<00:05:10.280> if<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.940> was

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
I find what this is if this was

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.820 
I find what this is if this was
reflective<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:12.930> fact<00:05:13.200> let's<00:05:13.440> just<00:05:13.500> do<00:05:13.680> what

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
reflective in fact let's just do what

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.040 
reflective in fact let's just do what
happened<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:15.240> video<00:05:15.920> right<00:05:16.920> here<00:05:16.980> when

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
happened in this video right here when

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.500 
happened in this video right here when
this<00:05:19.050> thing's<00:05:19.350> turned<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.920> if<00:05:20.610> you'll<00:05:21.000> rewind

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
this thing's turned on if you'll rewind

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.240 
this thing's turned on if you'll rewind
the<00:05:21.660> animation<00:05:22.140> to<00:05:22.590> where<00:05:22.800> we<00:05:23.040> have<00:05:23.130> this

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
the animation to where we have this

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.010 
the animation to where we have this
close-ups<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.090> can<00:05:24.210> actually<00:05:24.450> see<00:05:24.810> this

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
close-ups you can actually see this

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.160 
close-ups you can actually see this
already<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.940> rim<00:05:26.940> here<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.510> this<00:05:27.660> was<00:05:27.810> because

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
already a rim here and this was because

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.700 
already a rim here and this was because
I<00:05:28.440> animated<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:30.120> scene<00:05:30.480> by<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> camera<00:05:31.200> control

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
I animated the scene by a camera control

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.730 
I animated the scene by a camera control
on<00:05:32.960> this<00:05:33.960> edge

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
on this edge

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.130 
on this edge
however<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.669> reflection<00:05:36.240> behind<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.840> could

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
however the reflection behind it could

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.520 
however the reflection behind it could
already<00:05:37.380> see<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.040> anyway<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:38.750> all<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.810> did<00:05:40.080> there

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
already see it anyway so all I did there

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.500 
already see it anyway so all I did there
was<00:05:40.680> just<00:05:40.980> brighten<00:05:41.460> up<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.669> edges<00:05:42.030> instead

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
was just brighten up the edges instead

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.409 
was just brighten up the edges instead
of<00:05:42.600> actually<00:05:43.169> bringing<00:05:44.160> them<00:05:44.340> back<00:05:44.580> from

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
of actually bringing them back from

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.230 
of actually bringing them back from
nothing<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.710> if<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:47.370> use<00:05:47.520> this<00:05:47.820> scene<00:05:48.060> by

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
nothing so if you use this scene by

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.170 
nothing so if you use this scene by
camera<00:05:49.460> control<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:51.450> also<00:05:51.630> don't<00:05:52.050> get<00:05:52.230> a<00:05:52.380> live

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
camera control you also don't get a live

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.340 
camera control you also don't get a live
representation<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.360> what<00:05:54.570> you<00:05:54.690> doing<00:05:55.020> whereas

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
representation of what you doing whereas

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.290 
representation of what you doing whereas
with<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.680> display<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.520> do

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
with the display you do

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.869 
with the display you do
so<00:05:59.300> that's<00:05:59.599> two<00:06:00.080> ways<00:06:00.259> and<00:06:01.099> yet<00:06:01.280> another<00:06:01.580> way

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
so that's two ways and yet another way

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.990 
so that's two ways and yet another way
could<00:06:02.449> be<00:06:02.710> to<00:06:03.710> actually<00:06:04.250> animate<00:06:05.560> the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
could be to actually animate the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.909 
could be to actually animate the
luminance<00:06:08.000> switching<00:06:08.750> on<00:06:08.960> and<00:06:09.110> off<00:06:09.229> on<00:06:09.530> the

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
luminance switching on and off on the

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.499 
luminance switching on and off on the
material<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.639> would<00:06:10.759> have<00:06:10.879> to<00:06:11.000> take<00:06:11.180> off<00:06:11.389> the

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
material you would have to take off the

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.230 
material you would have to take off the
color<00:06:11.720> channel<00:06:12.520> but<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.639> problem<00:06:13.909> with<00:06:14.090> this

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
color channel but the problem with this

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.460 
color channel but the problem with this
is<00:06:14.509> when<00:06:14.780> it's<00:06:15.169> off<00:06:15.379> you'll<00:06:15.919> get<00:06:16.159> a<00:06:16.190> black<00:06:17.470> line

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
is when it's off you'll get a black line

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.369 
is when it's off you'll get a black line
and<00:06:18.909> then<00:06:19.909> when<00:06:20.030> it's<00:06:20.180> on<00:06:20.360> it's<00:06:20.810> white<00:06:21.080> so

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
and then when it's on it's white so

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.100 
and then when it's on it's white so
that's<00:06:21.620> okay<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.220> guess<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:23.810> know<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:23.990> just

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
that's okay I guess you know it just

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.619 
that's okay I guess you know it just
depends<00:06:24.500> on<00:06:24.650> what<00:06:24.800> you're<00:06:24.949> doing<00:06:24.979> and<00:06:25.629> you

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
depends on what you're doing and you

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.140 
depends on what you're doing and you
know<00:06:26.750> each<00:06:26.930> method<00:06:27.349> works<00:06:27.590> best<00:06:28.030> in<00:06:29.030> a

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
know each method works best in a

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.870 
know each method works best in a
different<00:06:29.479> situation<00:06:29.629> and<00:06:30.250> then<00:06:31.250> yet<00:06:31.580> another

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
different situation and then yet another

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.820 
different situation and then yet another
method<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.599> this<00:06:32.930> is<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.169> fourth<00:06:33.409> method

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
method and this is the fourth method

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.990 
method and this is the fourth method
which<00:06:34.039> I<00:06:34.900> probably<00:06:35.900> use<00:06:36.380> more<00:06:36.740> so<00:06:36.979> now<00:06:37.250> is<00:06:37.550> that

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
which I probably use more so now is that

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.020 
which I probably use more so now is that
I<00:06:38.030> basically<00:06:38.569> would<00:06:38.780> separate<00:06:39.259> my<00:06:39.560> scene<00:06:40.030> in

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
I basically would separate my scene in

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.020 
I basically would separate my scene in
two<00:06:41.300> different<00:06:41.539> renders<00:06:42.169> so<00:06:43.159> I<00:06:43.490> would<00:06:43.699> finish

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
two different renders so I would finish

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.909 
two different renders so I would finish
you<00:06:44.419> know<00:06:44.539> constructing<00:06:45.319> the<00:06:45.409> scene<00:06:45.680> and

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
you know constructing the scene and

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.249 
you know constructing the scene and
whatever<00:06:46.069> and<00:06:46.490> then<00:06:47.389> I<00:06:47.630> would<00:06:47.840> physically

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
whatever and then I would physically

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.809 
whatever and then I would physically
render<00:06:49.449> two<00:06:50.449> different<00:06:51.110> projects<00:06:51.650> or<00:06:51.819> render

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
render two different projects or render

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.700 
render two different projects or render
the<00:06:52.909> project<00:06:53.030> two<00:06:53.419> different<00:06:53.719> times<00:06:53.930> one<00:06:54.440> with

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
the project two different times one with

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.909 
the project two different times one with
just<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:55.159> text<00:06:55.520> and<00:06:55.719> one<00:06:56.719> with<00:06:57.199> just<00:06:57.560> the

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
just the text and one with just the

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.580 
just the text and one with just the
element<00:06:58.400> which<00:06:58.580> I<00:06:58.729> want<00:06:59.000> to<00:06:59.210> flick<00:06:59.599> it<00:06:59.629> this

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
element which I want to flick it this

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.010 
element which I want to flick it this
doesn't<00:07:00.979> always<00:07:01.159> work<00:07:01.490> because<00:07:02.419> sometimes<00:07:02.840> I

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
doesn't always work because sometimes I

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.980 
doesn't always work because sometimes I
may<00:07:03.139> not<00:07:03.289> have<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.830> type<00:07:04.430> of<00:07:04.460> control<00:07:04.789> but<00:07:05.330> if

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
may not have that type of control but if

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.290 
may not have that type of control but if
I<00:07:06.259> do<00:07:06.319> then<00:07:06.919> I<00:07:06.979> will<00:07:07.039> use<00:07:07.430> it<00:07:07.729> and<00:07:07.880> then<00:07:08.090> in

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
I do then I will use it and then in

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.360 
I do then I will use it and then in
after-effects<00:07:08.990> when<00:07:09.349> I<00:07:09.380> do<00:07:09.500> is<00:07:09.830> bring<00:07:10.099> the<00:07:10.219> two

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
after-effects when I do is bring the two

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.879 
after-effects when I do is bring the two
renders<00:07:10.729> together<00:07:11.060> and<00:07:11.389> then<00:07:12.259> animate<00:07:12.740> the

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
renders together and then animate the

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.920 
renders together and then animate the
opacity<00:07:12.919> of<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:13.940> render<00:07:14.300> which<00:07:14.479> I<00:07:14.690> want<00:07:14.870> to

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
opacity of the render which I want to

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.420 
opacity of the render which I want to
flick<00:07:15.139> it<00:07:15.319> and<00:07:15.469> that<00:07:15.800> gives<00:07:16.039> me<00:07:16.099> a<00:07:16.190> lot<00:07:16.340> of

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
flick it and that gives me a lot of

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.120 
flick it and that gives me a lot of
control<00:07:16.789> in<00:07:16.819> post-production<00:07:17.599> and<00:07:19.690> yeah<00:07:20.690> so

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
control in post-production and yeah so

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.830 
control in post-production and yeah so
you<00:07:22.130> know<00:07:22.159> I<00:07:22.250> hope<00:07:22.430> that<00:07:22.520> clears<00:07:23.270> that<00:07:23.599> up

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
you know I hope that clears that up

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.490 
you know I hope that clears that up
and<00:07:24.139> I<00:07:25.099> hope<00:07:25.639> you<00:07:25.900> you<00:07:26.900> know<00:07:27.020> found<00:07:27.380> this

real lights you can actually just

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.749 
real lights you can actually just

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759
