00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in this position now remember leg in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
in this position now remember leg in
between<00:02:05.790> hooks<00:02:06.270> onto<00:02:06.510> my<00:02:06.690> leg<00:02:06.870> this<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
between hooks onto my leg this is what I
