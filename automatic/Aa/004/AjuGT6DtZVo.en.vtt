00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.980 
bases have tuners rather like guitars
which<00:00:16.800> make<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.310> easy<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.180> alter<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
which make it very easy to alter the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.929 
which make it very easy to alter the
pitch

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.819 

when<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.089> in<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> situation<00:00:27.589> where<00:00:28.589> there's

when you in a situation where there's

when you in a situation where there's
not<00:00:29.009> much<00:00:29.220> noise<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.669> it's<00:00:30.509> very<00:00:30.840> easy<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
not much noise around it's very easy to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.009 
not much noise around it's very easy to
tune<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> open<00:00:32.099> strings<00:00:32.600> because<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.840> can

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
tune the open strings because you can

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.160 
tune the open strings because you can
hear<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.239> either<00:00:36.360> tune<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> piano

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hear them you can either tune to a piano

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.580 
hear them you can either tune to a piano
or<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.550> tune<00:00:38.790> using<00:00:39.449> one<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> these

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
or you can tune using one of these

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:52.470 
or you can tune using one of these
clip-on<00:00:41.100> tuners

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.729 

if<00:00:53.480> there's<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.809> lot<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.050> noise<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.590> room

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
if there's a lot of noise in the room

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.950 
if there's a lot of noise in the room
I'm<00:00:55.039> unlikely<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.850> be<00:00:56.030> able<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.300> hear<00:00:56.629> the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
I'm unlikely to be able to hear the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.680 
I'm unlikely to be able to hear the
pitch<00:00:57.199> clearly<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.129> open<00:00:58.399> string<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.510> what

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
pitch clearly of the open string so what

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
pitch clearly of the open string so what
I<00:00:59.719> do<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.440> tune<00:01:00.680> using<00:01:00.949> harmonics<00:01:03.519> at<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
I do is I tune using harmonics at the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.219 
I do is I tune using harmonics at the
beginning<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.119> an<00:01:05.210> orchestral<00:01:05.449> rehearsal<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
beginning of an orchestral rehearsal the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.800 
beginning of an orchestral rehearsal the
oboe<00:01:06.440> plays<00:01:06.680> an<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:07.940> will<00:01:08.090> tune<00:01:08.360> your<00:01:08.600> a

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
oboe plays an a and you will tune your a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.740 
oboe plays an a and you will tune your a
harmonic<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.369> D<00:01:10.520> string<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.869> note<00:01:12.020> a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
harmonic on the D string to the note a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.960 
harmonic on the D string to the note a
when<00:01:14.750> that's<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.140> tune<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:15.680> place<00:01:16.610> your<00:01:16.729> first

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
when that's in tune you place your first

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.420 
when that's in tune you place your first
finger<00:01:17.119> on<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.840> string<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.979> tune<00:01:19.190> that

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
finger on the a string to tune that

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:30.249 
finger on the a string to tune that
harmonic<00:01:28.179> once<00:01:29.179> these<00:01:29.390> two<00:01:29.659> strings<00:01:29.960> are<00:01:30.110> in

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
harmonic once these two strings are in

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.469 
harmonic once these two strings are in
tune<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.039> can<00:01:31.250> move<00:01:31.429> to<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> E

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
tune you can move to the a and the E

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.719 
tune you can move to the a and the E
string<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.740> play<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.100> harmonic<00:01:34.460> on<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
string you play the harmonic on the a

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.889 
string you play the harmonic on the a
string<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.569> you<00:01:35.659> know<00:01:35.869> is<00:01:36.050> in<00:01:36.080> tune<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:38.690> then

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
string that you know is in tune and then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.990 
string that you know is in tune and then
you<00:01:39.020> tune<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.409> E<00:01:39.440> string<00:01:42.369> finally<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.819> move

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
you tune the E string finally you move

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.640 
you tune the E string finally you move
to<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.270> top<00:01:44.450> two<00:01:44.630> strings
