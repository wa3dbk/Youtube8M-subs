00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.510 

just<00:00:46.350> cut<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.800> piece<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> don't

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
just cut a little piece if you don't

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
just cut a little piece if you don't
need<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.809> should<00:00:48.960> cut<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
need that much so you should cut a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.610 
need that much so you should cut a
little<00:00:49.260> piece<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.750> cut<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.230> piece

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
little piece off now just cut a piece

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.710 
little piece off now just cut a piece
like<00:00:59.489> that<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.460 

and<00:01:08.290> just<00:01:08.470> wrap<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.280> around<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> haven't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
and just wrap it around now I haven't

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.990 
and just wrap it around now I haven't
got<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.770> exact<00:01:15.750> same<00:01:16.750> thing<00:01:17.230> as<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
got the exact same thing as this that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.260 
got the exact same thing as this that
this<00:01:19.300> bullet<00:01:19.630> um<00:01:20.040> reason<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.160> because<00:01:21.430> you're

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
this bullet um reason is because you're

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.940 
this bullet um reason is because you're
just<00:01:22.390> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.660> get<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.900> you're<00:01:23.680> not<00:01:23.770> going<00:01:23.890> to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
just going to get it you're not going to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.130 
just going to get it you're not going to
get<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.100> same<00:01:24.250> every<00:01:24.460> time<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.990> keep

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
get the same every time so just keep

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.280 
get the same every time so just keep
doing<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.530> until<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:26.950> got<00:01:27.130> on<00:01:27.870> as<00:01:28.870> many<00:01:29.050> as<00:01:29.200> you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
doing it until you got on as many as you

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.240 
doing it until you got on as many as you
want<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:30.310> just<00:01:30.340> keep<00:01:30.640> cutting<00:01:31.920> our<00:01:32.920> new<00:01:33.070> little

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
want so just keep cutting our new little

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.320 
want so just keep cutting our new little
bit<00:01:33.460> number<00:01:36.330> um<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.310> actually<00:01:39.700> cover<00:01:40.119> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
bit number um you can actually cover the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.890 
bit number um you can actually cover the
hold<00:01:40.510> up<00:01:40.720> but<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:41.140> will<00:01:41.320> um<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:43.450> will<00:01:43.570> just<00:01:43.690> add

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
hold up but it will um it will just add

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500 
hold up but it will um it will just add
weight<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.470> do<00:01:44.590> nothing<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.479> I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
weight to it and do nothing so I

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.280 
weight to it and do nothing so I
recommend<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.410> don't<00:01:47.500> do<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.990> make

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
recommend you don't do that and make

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.070 
recommend you don't do that and make
sure<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:54.270> tape<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.540> flat<00:01:55.900> because<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.840> not

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
sure that tape is flat because it's not

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.570 
sure that tape is flat because it's not
then<00:01:59.290> it's<00:01:59.619> just<00:01:59.890> going<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.100> have<00:02:00.250> another

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
then it's just going to have another

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.890 
then it's just going to have another
curve<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.960> cover<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.440> front<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
curve and don't cover the front of the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.850 
curve and don't cover the front of the
streamline<00:02:08.670> ok<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.700> will<00:02:10.080> come<00:02:11.080> back<00:02:11.260> when<00:02:11.500> I've

now just while I load this up um this
only<00:02:52.120> increases<00:02:52.690> accuracy<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.709> don't<00:02:54.610> know

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
only increases accuracy I don't know

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.660 
only increases accuracy I don't know
about<00:02:55.120> um<00:02:56.519> distance<00:02:57.540> only<00:02:58.540> note<00:02:58.930> accuracy<00:02:59.350> sir

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670
