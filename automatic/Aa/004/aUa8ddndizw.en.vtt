 learn to plant a baby foot in your hand 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.500
 Holy I understand, so I come from this side. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 right here inside the property 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.020
 today I have to embrace the following the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.740
 dairy cattle and this cat has to be 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 well treated 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 So here you have planting cane planting 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.150
 of grass and so on with the coming 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.020
 from the full bar here 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.759
 property was that I started to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 learn to play a month to learn how to 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.280
 apply what the saw needs the fruit 20 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 and that's one thing I see that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 I already took a future in that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.670
 sure is a reality through them that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.219
 has reached the point that it is trying to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.880
 planted has been treated like 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.480
 got the quality of hair 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.120
 the mec arrived at the captain's point 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.819
 Understanding this to me was one thing. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.739
 very welcome because the law and I 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.040
 I'm sure things will go. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.410
 happen and I learned one more 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.630
 thing I did not know or did not know 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.849
 for example asking for an analysis 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.430
 to know what the land asks for 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.110
 for her to produce a fruit you have 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.910
 trend was that I could not play will 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.489
 indicate that Egypt as a million I do not 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.890
 I threw away and treated a pulley that 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.590
 that by feeling that production stabilized 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.780
 If so, I was not very slow to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.380
 our average that the sound team that wants 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 to know is an average of 170 food per 6 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.799
 we take a little bit is not much then 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.010
 the next one has the pasture that has been fertilized 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.290
 was corrected the area so we like it already 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.450
 It's in the dry you look at the bird and 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.840
 this is an advantage that the cow goes there 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.450
 she thinks the bud she eat her song 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.420
 find the protocol and it produces 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.450
 it returns and that it returns report 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.340
 understood then this is one of the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.700
 things that I see that I am 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.160
 taking advantage to the bed there is there 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.190
 the fruit of people's work 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.160
 The law is there that I tell you that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.639
 began to come to my knowledge 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.500
 person and my family because I get 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.440
 My wife, who's coming with me here? 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.380
 also have to know through the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.989
 agronomist of the program is that 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.510
 brought the knowledge to me that I 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.480
 I think it's the same as thick and Brazil is not 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.270
 there is a better place in the world to climb 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.310
 we 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.790
 because this thick bush has a lot of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.950
 wealth that thick bush for TV 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.600
 caprice and not for a budget very well 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.600
 I do not drink at all
