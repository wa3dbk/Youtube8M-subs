00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
and the music I'm profoundly deaths if I

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.190 
and the music I'm profoundly deaths if I
didn't<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:30.340> them<00:00:30.669> here<00:00:31.329> at<00:00:31.599> all

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
didn't have them here at all

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.270 
didn't have them here at all
I<00:00:32.230> mean<00:00:32.980> seven<00:00:34.260> second<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.410> school<00:00:35.800> I<00:00:35.950> mean<00:00:36.160> I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
I mean seven second to school I mean I

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I mean seven second to school I mean I
found<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.880> all<00:00:37.000> right

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
found it all right

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.960 
found it all right
I<00:00:37.660> think<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.739> lot<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.310> the<00:00:39.460> changes<00:00:39.790> were<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
I think a lot of the changes were the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.420 
I think a lot of the changes were the
same<00:00:40.210> for<00:00:40.239> all<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.170> children<00:00:41.410> they<00:00:42.130> come<00:00:42.280> from

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
same for all the children they come from

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240 
same for all the children they come from
a<00:00:42.520> much<00:00:42.640> smaller<00:00:42.699> school<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.350> school<00:00:44.800> where

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
a much smaller school to a school where

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.520 
a much smaller school to a school where
the<00:00:45.730> Year<00:00:46.510> group<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:46.960> bigger<00:00:47.140> than<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.410> whole

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the Year group is bigger than the whole

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.400 
the Year group is bigger than the whole
junior<00:00:48.010> school<00:00:48.340> it's<00:00:49.059> in<00:00:49.510> multiple<00:00:49.690> buildings

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
junior school it's in multiple buildings

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.680 
junior school it's in multiple buildings
so<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.129> there's<00:00:51.609> all<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.850> issues<00:00:52.180> there<00:00:52.480> but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
so that there's all the issues there but

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.479 
so that there's all the issues there but
I<00:00:53.140> think<00:00:53.230> some<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.710> things<00:00:53.769> that<00:00:54.070> James

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
I think some of the things that James

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.810 
I think some of the things that James
had<00:00:54.789> was<00:00:55.239> getting<00:00:55.780> used<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:57.010> voices<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
had was getting used to the voices the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.009 
had was getting used to the voices the
accents<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.660> 15<00:00:59.530> new<00:00:59.829> teachers<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:01.019> working

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
accents of 15 new teachers and working

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.110 
accents of 15 new teachers and working
with<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.649> different<00:01:03.250> teaching<00:01:03.460> assistant<00:01:03.969> in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
with a different teaching assistant in

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.000 
with a different teaching assistant in
each<00:01:04.300> class<00:01:04.839> rather<00:01:05.260> than<00:01:05.500> having<00:01:05.680> one<00:01:05.980> with

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
each class rather than having one with

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.510 
each class rather than having one with
him<00:01:06.340> all<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.610> time<00:01:06.820> they<00:01:07.360> switch<00:01:08.290> from<00:01:08.530> moving

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
him all the time they switch from moving

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.720 
him all the time they switch from moving
to<00:01:09.640> having<00:01:09.970> different<00:01:11.010> TAS<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.310> all<00:01:12.490> the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
to having different TAS in all the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.429 
to having different TAS in all the
lessons<00:01:13.120> as<00:01:13.300> opposed<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.600> having<00:01:13.720> one<00:01:13.960> TA<00:01:14.170> with

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
lessons as opposed to having one TA with

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.920 
lessons as opposed to having one TA with
you<00:01:14.500> all<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.890> time<00:01:14.970> has<00:01:15.970> been<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.180> big<00:01:16.479> change<00:01:16.750> I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
you all the time has been a big change I

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.730 
you all the time has been a big change I
think<00:01:17.020> that's<00:01:17.229> been<00:01:17.320> quite<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.530> positive

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
think that's been quite a positive

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.910 
think that's been quite a positive
change<00:01:18.220> as<00:01:18.490> well<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:20.229> know<00:01:20.350> he<00:01:20.470> doesn't<00:01:20.650> rely

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
change as well you know he doesn't rely

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.230 
change as well you know he doesn't rely
on<00:01:20.950> one<00:01:21.189> person<00:01:21.220> anymore

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
on one person anymore

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.109 
on one person anymore

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
they put in three sound field systems

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.679 
they put in three sound field systems
we've<00:01:40.060> got<00:01:40.270> those<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:41.049> his<00:01:41.670> key<00:01:42.670> lessons<00:01:43.210> for

we've got those in his key lessons for

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.440 
we've got those in his key lessons for
English<00:01:44.320> maths<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.130> science<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.880> think<00:01:46.090> thank

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
English maths and science I think thank

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.789 
English maths and science I think thank
the<00:01:46.570> sound<00:01:46.810> field<00:01:47.079> systems<00:01:47.469> are<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.619> key

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
the sound field systems are the key

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.170 
the sound field systems are the key
thing<00:01:48.070> those<00:01:48.280> are<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.549> things<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.790> help<00:01:49.000> him

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
thing those are the things that help him

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.749 
thing those are the things that help him
the<00:01:49.329> most<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.439> we<00:01:50.530> ideally<00:01:51.219> we'd<00:01:51.369> like<00:01:51.399> one<00:01:51.670> of

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
the most and we ideally we'd like one of

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.700 
the most and we ideally we'd like one of
those<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.000> every<00:01:52.149> classroom<00:01:52.600> he<00:01:52.869> goes<00:01:53.079> into<00:01:53.289> I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
those in every classroom he goes into I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.969 
those in every classroom he goes into I
think<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.090> school<00:01:55.390> now<00:01:55.710> realise<00:01:56.710> how

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
think the school now realise how

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.399 
think the school now realise how
beneficial<00:01:57.430> they<00:01:57.909> are<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.390> James<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:59.049> all<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
beneficial they are to James and all the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.690 
beneficial they are to James and all the
other<00:01:59.530> children<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.039> class<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.579> so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
other children in the class and so

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.830 
other children in the class and so
hopefully<00:02:01.060> they're<00:02:01.180> gonna<00:02:01.270> get<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> few<00:02:01.689> more

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
hopefully they're gonna get a few more

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.580 
hopefully they're gonna get a few more
in<00:02:01.899> see<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.530> often<00:02:03.159> ask<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.759> teachers<00:02:04.689> but<00:02:05.200> I
