zoom<00:03:44.930> has<00:03:45.230> 20<00:03:46.129> in<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.310> pack<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.870> Rover<00:03:47.870> worm<00:03:47.989> had

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
zoom has 20 in a pack and Rover worm had

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.330 
zoom has 20 in a pack and Rover worm had
like<00:03:48.349> eight<00:03:48.530> or<00:03:48.769> nine<00:03:48.829> another<00:03:49.669> pack<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:50.290> zoom

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
like eight or nine another pack so zoom

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.229 
like eight or nine another pack so zoom
definitely<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> better<00:03:52.519> deal<00:03:52.729> and<00:03:52.970> then<00:03:53.060> this

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
is another pack finish forms in

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.059 
is another pack finish forms in
