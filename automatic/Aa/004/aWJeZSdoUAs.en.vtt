00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
sway bars this is the this is the slot

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.500 
sway bars this is the this is the slot
bar<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.469> is<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.769> stone<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:15.120> notice

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
bar and this is the stone I just notice

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.050 
bar and this is the stone I just notice
how<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:17.299> how<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.359> bar<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:20.060> situated

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
how the how the bar is situated

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.369 
how the how the bar is situated
underneath<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.479> car<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.229> match

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
underneath the car so that you can match

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.110 
underneath the car so that you can match
it<00:03:22.409> and<00:03:23.250> see<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.209> where<00:03:25.310> yeah<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.970> is

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it and see this is where yeah this is

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.629 
it and see this is where yeah this is
where<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.979> the<00:03:28.979> other<00:03:29.189> bar<00:03:30.229> broke<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:32.430> right

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
where the the other bar broke is right

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.559 
where the the other bar broke is right
there<00:03:32.909> or<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:33.930> bushing<00:03:34.439> would<00:03:34.590> go<00:03:34.939> so<00:03:35.939> this

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
there or that bushing would go so this

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.849 
there or that bushing would go so this
one<00:03:37.069> again<00:03:38.129> look<00:03:38.909> at<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:40.079> Hollow<00:03:40.379> and

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
one again look at that it's Hollow and

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.610 
one again look at that it's Hollow and
it's<00:03:41.790> kind<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.239> rusted<00:03:42.629> out<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.259> kind<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.530> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
it's kind of rusted out it's kind of a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.129 
it's kind of rusted out it's kind of a
piece<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.949> trash<00:03:44.870> whereas<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.049> one<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:48.139> mean

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
piece of trash whereas this one I mean

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.659 
piece of trash whereas this one I mean
that's<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.620> as<00:03:49.799> solid<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.310> you're<00:03:50.489> going<00:03:50.609> to

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
that's about as solid as you're going to

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.349 
that's about as solid as you're going to
get<00:03:50.849> so<00:03:51.569> I'm<00:03:52.229> going<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.879> slide<00:03:53.879> off<00:03:54.090> these

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
get so I'm going to slide off these

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.429 
get so I'm going to slide off these
these<00:03:54.989> bushings<00:03:55.379> here<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:55.909> best<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.930> that

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
these bushings here as best I can that

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.689 
these bushings here as best I can that
might<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:58.949> be<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.099> easiest<00:03:59.340> thing<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.579> all

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
might not be the easiest thing of all
