00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 from the mojave desert and the valley 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.519
 of death highway 395 leads to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.009
 the heights of the mental saw 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.390
 soon more vegetation appears and more water 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.210
 because this is a region of lakes 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.550
 many seem like postcard like 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.579
 june lake against the background of karts 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.740
 antich a snowy mass of almost 11,000 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.990
 feet 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.240
 but of all the lakes of the sierra 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.670
 oriental without doubt the strangest is the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.559
 lake mono was formed approximately 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 seven hundred and sixty thousand years what 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.250
 becomes one of the oldest in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.930
 North America has no outlet to the sea 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.970
 which means that all the water that 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.190
 ends here has only one 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.350
 exit the evaporation and that leaves all 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.640
 mineral accumulation class because 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.260
 causes the formation of what here 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.510
 they call truffles 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.340
 the writer and humorist Martin le 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.620
 baptized as the Dead Sea of ​​California 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.290
 a short distance is the highway 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.350
 120 that will take us to the highest step of 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.120
 all the sierra but cats that with almost 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.930
 10,000 feet is closed by snow 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.360
 much of the year this is the least route 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.520
 traveled to get to the east to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.460
 the masterpiece of the junior naturalist 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.820
 Yosemite National Park and that with 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.310
 the thaw changes color 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.350
 his hands are covered in green for all 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 sides reappears wildlife and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.130
 most of the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.830
 three and a half million tourists that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 receives a year the vast majority of them 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.290
 it stays in the valley what it represents 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.640
 only 5% of the 1,200 square miles 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.920
 who has this valuable heritage 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.440
 world of humanity and it is the first 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.420
 Once I come and leave, happy to have 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.080
 known one of the wonders of the world 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.340
 they describe it and they are very right I 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.780
 I know a thousand and it's always changing with 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.700
 the seasons but spring the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.619
 most box office show are the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.340
 waterfalls especially I know doctors 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.289
 its three jumps measure two thousand 425 feet 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.509
 of height which makes it the most 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.060
 high throughout North America still 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.649
 this show is temporary because its 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.140
 waters stop flowing in August when it 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.970
 they finish melting the snows of the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.800
 sierra disappears by summer and the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.980
 autumn but returns in the winter with 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.110
 another protagonist the ice 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 beautiful really 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
 no doubt nobody wants to get lost 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.350
 stunning landscapes that seem to be 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.990
 the work of classical painters or the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.640
 opportunity to touch the sky by climbing 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.190
 granite monoliths like the imposing 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.680
 captain 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.530
 or the occasion of visiting the giants 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.170
 living the grove butterfly onions 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.360
 the biggest trees in the world that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.360
 they date from seven centuries before Christ 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.450
 but every few dusk but 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.450
 very lucky that they undertake the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 pilgrimage to glazer point or point 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.060
 of the glacier with a single purpose 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.280
 witness an elevation of 7200 feet 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.910
 as the sunset paints the silhouette 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.950
 semicircular leaving a half dome that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.530
 like the dome of a church is for 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.980
 many the spiritual center and symbol 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.310
 from the park 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.680
 you feel tiny before the creator 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.129
 you are something very tiny before this 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.129
 immensity
