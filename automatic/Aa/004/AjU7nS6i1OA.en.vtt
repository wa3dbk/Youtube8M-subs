00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
caveman diet and there's a theory behind

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
caveman diet and there's a theory behind
it<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.000> talk<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> me<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.500> this

it so talk to me about that sure so this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.070 
it so talk to me about that sure so this
is<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> Paleolithic<00:02:08.759> diet<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.300> caveman<00:02:09.840> diet

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
is the Paleolithic diet the caveman diet

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
is the Paleolithic diet the caveman diet
the<00:02:10.380> prehistoric<00:02:10.769> diet<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.670> basically<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the prehistoric diet and basically the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.199 
the prehistoric diet and basically the
claim<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:14.100> need<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> eat<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.880> nature

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
claim is we need to eat the way nature

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.270 
claim is we need to eat the way nature
intended<00:02:15.870> us<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.019> eat<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.620> all<00:02:16.830> about<00:02:17.130> our

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
intended us to eat it's all about our

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.039 
intended us to eat it's all about our
genes<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:18.239> need<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.540> eat<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:18.900> our

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
genes we need to eat like our

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.890 
genes we need to eat like our
Paleolithic<00:02:19.769> ancestors<00:02:20.400> who<00:02:21.000> were<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
Paleolithic ancestors who were on this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.150 
Paleolithic ancestors who were on this
earth<00:02:22.049> for<00:02:22.290> two<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> half<00:02:22.650> million<00:02:23.010> years

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
earth for two and a half million years

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340 
earth for two and a half million years
before<00:02:23.549> grains<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.420> agriculture<00:02:25.140> came

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
before grains and agriculture came

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.770 
before grains and agriculture came
around<00:02:25.650> okay<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.940> left<00:02:27.299> if<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
around okay so you know I left if you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.449 
around okay so you know I left if you
can't<00:02:27.959> explain<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> specific<00:02:29.130> rules

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
can't explain it on the specific rules

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
can't explain it on the specific rules
so<00:02:30.000> yeah<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.959> would<00:02:31.080> look

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
so yeah then what this really would look

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.330 
so yeah then what this really would look
like<00:02:31.319> if<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.500> were<00:02:31.530> adapted<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.040> their<00:02:32.160> life

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
like if they were adapted to their life

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.880 
like if they were adapted to their life
okay<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.560> Paleolithic<00:02:34.560> means

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
okay so as you can see Paleolithic means

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.160 
okay so as you can see Paleolithic means
fruits<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.489> vegetables<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.209> gathering<00:02:36.900> and

fruits and vegetables so gathering and
then<00:02:37.500> hunting<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.190> lots<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.700> meats<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.150> lean

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
then hunting so lots of meats and lean

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.759 
then hunting so lots of meats and lean
protein<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.140> let's<00:02:40.350> look<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> typical
