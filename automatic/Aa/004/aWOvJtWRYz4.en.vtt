00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.990 
idea to try to help and eliminate it at
least<00:02:18.349> that's<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:18.709> I'm<00:02:18.920> thinking<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.760> I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
least that's what I'm thinking is for I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.940 
least that's what I'm thinking is for I
couldn't<00:02:20.629> really<00:02:20.780> tell<00:02:21.109> what<00:02:21.349> was<00:02:21.500> going<00:02:21.590> on

couldn't really tell what was going on

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.440 
couldn't really tell what was going on
but<00:02:22.099> I'm<00:02:22.219> pretty<00:02:22.459> sure<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.939> that's<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.299> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
but I'm pretty sure that that's what it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.559 
but I'm pretty sure that that's what it
was<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:24.140> did<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.069> little<00:02:25.310> there's<00:02:25.609> a<00:02:25.700> mixed

going up the bottom bracket is turning

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.099 
going up the bottom bracket is turning
this<00:03:07.189> way<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.669> compresses<00:03:08.030> down<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.900> give

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
this way as it compresses down to give

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.860 
this way as it compresses down to give
you<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> little<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.739> more<00:03:09.919> chain<00:03:10.310> stretch<00:03:11.150> so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
you a little bit more chain stretch so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.379 
you a little bit more chain stretch so
that<00:03:12.019> it's<00:03:12.139> not<00:03:12.290> quite<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.590> tight<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.389> thought

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
that it's not quite so tight I thought

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.809 
that it's not quite so tight I thought
it<00:03:14.510> was<00:03:14.629> really<00:03:14.870> unique<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.489> kind<00:03:16.760> of

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
it was really unique it's really kind of
