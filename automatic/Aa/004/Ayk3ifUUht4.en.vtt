00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.750
 Processed by myself

 Using a brush 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.130
 This 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.600

 Well then first of all 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.880
 Here to enter 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 After all 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.000
 This Fuji ahead 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.480
 Went dipped 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.340
 And 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 I feel like this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.950
 Or Ysaye and this 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.950
 I feel that the daytime bar is weak 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.710
 I know something good site 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.660
 That the silver 4 is together 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.370
 Change in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.870

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.520
 Well then this is 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.750
 2 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.620
 this is 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 In the cup 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.500
 I want to put in 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.560
 It is received 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.560
 I greeted pile because I examined 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.519
 Oh you are better of here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.519
 Overwhelming 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.240
 Nonia to be fixed 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.830
 Toka tweezers to say with it 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.830
 After fixing the tire 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.780
 I was surely doing this 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.489
 I wonder if it is difficult to see in the shadows 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.020
 Gimon 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.020
 After stopping 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.160
 This way 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.970
 Over there or escape to go mast 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.970
 Take off work 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.900
 In the tire 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.080
 Because I do not need to paint that clear 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.710
 It becomes clear chart security delay 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.120
 I 'm tired of tire 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:42.430
 There are only two of these actually 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.430
 This is a tire of Zenrin 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.520
 It is quite troublesome to say other previous members 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.520
 In the chain 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.680
 I 'm using a good brush 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.810
 It's an airplane 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.660
 Inside the tire 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:12.950
 It's not an ordinary air, I think that is good 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 Is more of shaking mark something wise man entered 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:21.019
 Something good 6 for the late ceremony 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.400
 I do not know in why or deep 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.400
 It seems that it contains 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.720
 But compared to jumbo, the wind of the tires wo n't celebrate 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.490
 It is easy 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.490
 It has become quite like a tire 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.410
 Ok ok Kansai 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.410
 It is the solar system 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.599
 It feels like chat 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.960
 tire 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.370
 Kansai 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.190
 Then 8 tires 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.240
 There as seat 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.670
 We did not introduce and help 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.870
 Ugh 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.370
 Ny 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.729
 I will put on 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.930
 Well this is 10 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:25.780
 After Bart's training 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:33.870
 It will be cool if you put objective vermilion on the top 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.870
 Well if from Toko of the rear wheels will kana all limit is in the best Abuna is to 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.030
 I will cut 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.800
 It's really thin tire 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.669
 Something has been made up to the middle 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.669
 That's fine 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.310
 It such is the feeling 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.650
 here 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.190
 I will put on a bat 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.190
 In this 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.040
 How 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.040
 Fixed 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.570
 I know this quite softeningｰｰｰ 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.570
 Unexpectedly do not do it carefully 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.510
 I 'll feel bad afterward 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.009
 You should go on paper 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.970
 Temporary coal 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.970
 What kind of feeling will be 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:58.389
 When've taken 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.389
 There are times when it is hard to know the tire 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:09.150
 Sometimes it's too late, it's too addicting, and it's also a mess. 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:14.490
 By using a ball pen stone have your limelight 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:16.420
 It is this hole rain of the tire It is only a little high correction 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.830
 Ereba 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.830
 I think that is probably good 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.030
 I will work like this 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.870
 Good 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.870
 that's all
