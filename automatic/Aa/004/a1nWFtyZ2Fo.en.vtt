now I've got the grip and then I can go

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.330 
now I've got the grip and then I can go
to<00:00:33.430> throttle<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.570> that's<00:00:34.870> that's<00:00:35.340> you're

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
to throttle and that's that's you're

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.130 
to throttle and that's that's you're
looking<00:00:36.610> for<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.390> feel<00:00:37.720> that<00:00:37.750> that

that<00:00:38.500> that's<00:00:39.280> taking<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.090> set<00:00:40.329> that's<00:00:40.600> really

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
that that's taking a set that's really

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.300 
that that's taking a set that's really
what<00:00:41.079> that's<00:00:41.320> what<00:00:41.560> as<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.680> driver<00:00:41.950> is<00:00:42.100> what<00:00:42.220> you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
what that's what as a driver is what you

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.830 
what that's what as a driver is what you
feel<00:00:42.489> in<00:00:42.640> as<00:00:42.970> soon<00:00:43.090> as<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.510> quicker<00:00:43.720> it

the corner because it's okay there it is
let's<00:00:47.890> go<00:00:48.070> okay<00:00:48.579> there<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:48.910> let's<00:00:49.210> go<00:00:49.390> but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
let's go okay there it is let's go but

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.940 
let's go okay there it is let's go but
when<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:49.960> waiting<00:00:50.170> for<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:50.440> Felix<00:00:50.800> like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
when you waiting for that Felix like

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.440 
when you waiting for that Felix like
where<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.310> where<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.760> where<00:00:51.880> is<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.149> all

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
where is it where is it where is it all

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.270 
where is it where is it where is it all
the<00:00:52.780> time<00:00:52.960> rapper<00:00:53.200> throttle<00:00:53.590> you<00:00:54.130> know<00:00:54.220> the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
the time rapper throttle you know the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.620 
the time rapper throttle you know the
speeds<00:00:54.550> dropping<00:00:54.910> down<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.120> speeds<00:00:55.360> dropping

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
speeds dropping down and speeds dropping

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.120 
speeds dropping down and speeds dropping
down<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.290> then<00:00:56.590> you<00:00:56.649> have<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.860> accelerate

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
down and then you have to accelerate

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.400 
down and then you have to accelerate
further<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:58.210> over<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.809> course<00:00:58.899> for<00:00:59.110> laughs<00:00:59.230> it

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
further so over the course for laughs it

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.290 
further so over the course for laughs it
could<00:00:59.559> be<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.829> second<00:01:00.160> lap<00:01:00.280> slower<00:01:00.399> so<00:01:01.030> all<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
could be a second lap slower so all the

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.100 
could be a second lap slower so all the
time<00:01:01.480> you're<00:01:01.570> looking<00:01:01.630> for<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.840> car<00:01:01.989> that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
time you're looking for a car that's

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.670 
time you're looking for a car that's
crisp<00:01:02.440> sharp<00:01:03.210> responsive<00:01:04.320> giving<00:01:05.320> good<00:01:05.470> feel

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
crisp sharp responsive giving good feel

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.770 
crisp sharp responsive giving good feel
and<00:01:06.070> then<00:01:06.460> okay<00:01:07.210> right<00:01:07.420> I've<00:01:07.510> got<00:01:07.630> everything

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
and then okay right I've got everything

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.300 
and then okay right I've got everything
I<00:01:07.900> need<00:01:07.930> now<00:01:08.260> now<00:01:08.500> I'm<00:01:08.560> gonna<00:01:08.680> now<00:01:09.100> I'm<00:01:09.159> gonna

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
I need now now I'm gonna now I'm gonna

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.710 
I need now now I'm gonna now I'm gonna
push<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> limit<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.360> once<00:01:10.479> you've<00:01:10.600> got

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
push it to the limit and once you've got

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.480 
push it to the limit and once you've got
that<00:01:10.900> that's<00:01:11.890> hopefully<00:01:12.159> when<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.280> get<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
that that's hopefully when you get the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.420 
that that's hopefully when you get the
lap<00:01:12.610> time<00:01:13.110> ultimately<00:01:14.110> it's<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.920> drivers

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
lap time ultimately it's the drivers

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.180 
lap time ultimately it's the drivers
feeling<00:01:15.909> if<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.510> look<00:01:16.750> there's<00:01:17.470> there's<00:01:18.040> the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
feeling if you look there's there's the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.039 
feeling if you look there's there's the
maximum<00:01:18.700> cornering<00:01:19.180> power<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:19.900> be

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
maximum cornering power that can be

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.310 
maximum cornering power that can be
attained<00:01:20.380> from<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.740> tires<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.720> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
attained from the tires and that is a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.890 
attained from the tires and that is a
pretty<00:01:24.070> high<00:01:24.310> level<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.850> fairly<00:01:25.180> consistent

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
pretty high level and fairly consistent

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
say across our products but the ultimate

that<00:01:34.930> performance<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.040> contact<00:01:36.670> patch

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
that performance of the contact patch

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.480 
that performance of the contact patch
for<00:01:37.240> grip<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:38.260> getting<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.860> feeling<00:01:39.340> for

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
for grip it's getting the feeling for

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.520 
for grip it's getting the feeling for
the<00:01:39.610> driver<00:01:39.939> right<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.600> they<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the driver right so they have the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.679 
the driver right so they have the
confidence<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:42.460> charge<00:01:42.820> into<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.330> corner

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
confidence to charge into the corner

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.440 
confidence to charge into the corner
deep<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.680> put<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.130> maximum<00:01:45.820> effort<00:01:46.150> into

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
deep to put the maximum effort into

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.330 
deep to put the maximum effort into
cornering<00:01:46.930> as<00:01:47.049> quickly<00:01:47.350> as<00:01:47.619> possible<00:01:47.680> and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
cornering as quickly as possible and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.039 
cornering as quickly as possible and
then<00:01:48.729> allowing<00:01:49.030> them<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.509> get<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:49.900> the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
then allowing them to get on the

they<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.820> ultimate<00:01:58.450> feel<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.320> it's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
they like in that ultimate feel so it's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.050 
they like in that ultimate feel so it's
a<00:01:59.560> challenge<00:01:59.979> for<00:02:00.040> us<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.310> have<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> package

throughout a session feel that the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.540 
throughout a session feel that the
driver<00:02:18.450> gets<00:02:18.930> when<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.950> they<00:02:20.070> turn<00:02:20.370> the

that's when the load starts the build

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's when the load starts the build
you<00:02:30.240> feel<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.750> through<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.050> steering<00:02:31.380> wheel

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
you feel it through the steering wheel

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
and you feel it through your butt you

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.390 
and you feel it through your butt you
can<00:02:34.020> feel<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> load<00:02:34.560> start<00:02:34.890> building<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
can feel the load start building and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.270 
can feel the load start building and
that<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.630> combination<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.160> know

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that that's a combination of you know

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.949 
that that's a combination of you know
the<00:02:38.580> quickness<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> steering<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the quickness of the steering and the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
the quickness of the steering and the
shock<00:02:40.709> tuning<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.670> spring<00:02:41.970> rate<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
sway bar but all that feel has to do

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.580 
sway bar but all that feel has to do
with<00:02:46.459> how<00:02:47.459> soon<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.150> transfer<00:02:48.750> energy<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
with how soon you transfer energy to the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.370 
with how soon you transfer energy to the
contact<00:02:50.040> match<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> tire<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.450> make<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
contact match of the tire and make the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.690 
contact match of the tire and make the
tyre<00:02:52.560> spark<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.130> if<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.550> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
tyre spark up and you know if you if you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.160 
tyre spark up and you know if you if you
put<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.060> too<00:02:57.239> quick<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.690> make<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.989> car

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
put it in too quick it can make the car

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.410 
put it in too quick it can make the car
dirty<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.700> make<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> tire<00:03:00.209> go

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
dirty and then you can make the tire go

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.910 
dirty and then you can make the tire go
over<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> top<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.080> its<00:03:01.260> temperature<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> then

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
over the top on its temperature and then

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.650 
over the top on its temperature and then
it<00:03:02.040> will<00:03:02.160> push<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.300> put<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.570> in

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
it will push if you don't put it in

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.750 
it will push if you don't put it in
enough<00:03:03.959> then<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> car<00:03:04.410> feels<00:03:04.760> non-compliant

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
enough then the car feels non-compliant

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.229 
enough then the car feels non-compliant
it<00:03:05.820> feels<00:03:06.000> too<00:03:06.239> compliant<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.140> falls<00:03:07.350> over<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
it feels too compliant it falls over and

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.150 
it feels too compliant it falls over and
in<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.750> then<00:03:09.959> what<00:03:10.110> happens<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.950> driver

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
in and then what happens is the driver

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.130 
in and then what happens is the driver
will<00:03:11.430> end<00:03:11.640> up<00:03:11.790> putting<00:03:11.970> more<00:03:12.239> input<00:03:12.720> into<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
will end up putting more input into the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.590 
will end up putting more input into the
car<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.580> tire<00:03:14.760> will<00:03:14.970> finally<00:03:15.480> make

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
car and then the tire will finally make

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.410 
car and then the tire will finally make
heat<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.200> will<00:03:16.290> cause<00:03:16.440> oversteer<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:18.150> car

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
heat and it will cause oversteer the car

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600 
heat and it will cause oversteer the car
will<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.560> will<00:03:19.739> get<00:03:20.010> snap<00:03:20.250> oversteer

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
will you know will get snap oversteer

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.900 
will you know will get snap oversteer
because<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.239> put<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.260> much<00:03:22.320> slip<00:03:22.950> angle<00:03:23.280> into

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
because you put so much slip angle into

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.940 
because you put so much slip angle into

the tire that when it finally does build
temperature

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
temperature

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.580 
temperature
you<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.300> turn<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.870> much<00:03:28.050> just<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.320> but<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you have it turn so much just a but it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.180 
you have it turn so much just a but it
does<00:03:28.770> overseers<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.910> clothes<00:03:30.210> of<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.480> car<00:03:30.630> so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
does overseers and clothes of the car so

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.650 
does overseers and clothes of the car so
with<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> shock<00:03:32.520> tuning<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.180> tune<00:03:33.390> how

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
with the shock tuning you can tune how

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.500 
with the shock tuning you can tune how
soon<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.620> applies<00:03:35.370> pressure<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.030> face<00:03:36.330> of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
soon it applies pressure to that face of

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.260 
soon it applies pressure to that face of
the<00:03:36.600> tire<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.850> when<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.000> driver

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
the tire so you know when the driver

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.270 
the tire so you know when the driver
does<00:03:39.570> move<00:03:39.840> his<00:03:40.020> hands<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.740> responds<00:03:41.220> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
does move his hands that it responds to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.260 
does move his hands that it responds to
his<00:03:41.490> hands<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:43.620> black<00:03:44.100> art<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.550> know<00:03:44.670> he's<00:03:44.760> you

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
his hands a black art you know he's you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.790 
his hands a black art you know he's you
can<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.990> difference<00:03:46.230> between<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.440> good<00:03:46.590> setup

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
can the difference between a good setup

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.100 
can the difference between a good setup
and<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> bad<00:03:47.130> setup<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:47.910> one<00:03:48.570> small<00:03:48.780> change

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
and a bad setup can be one small change

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.990 
and a bad setup can be one small change
here<00:03:49.200> one<00:03:49.530> small<00:03:49.740> change<00:03:49.920> there<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.850> know

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
here one small change there and you know

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.210 
here one small change there and you know
it's<00:03:51.300> there's<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> fair<00:03:52.500> amount<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.770> look<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.100> it

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's there's a fair amount of look in it

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.790 
it's there's a fair amount of look in it
and<00:03:53.400> usually<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> pretty<00:03:55.110> good<00:03:55.290> educated

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
and usually it's a pretty good educated

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.220 
and usually it's a pretty good educated
guess<00:03:55.980> but<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.570> racing<00:03:57.960> was<00:03:58.050> easy

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
guess but it's it's if racing was easy

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.030 
guess but it's it's if racing was easy
you<00:03:58.680> know

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.380 
you know
then<00:03:59.670> we'd<00:04:00.630> all<00:04:00.750> been<00:04:00.870> doing<00:04:01.050> inside
