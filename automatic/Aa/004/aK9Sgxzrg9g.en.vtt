you know we didn't eat like these
massive<00:01:54.380> meals<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.430> when<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.610> came<00:01:55.910> here<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.420> I

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
massive meals so when I came here and I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.180 
massive meals so when I came here and I
was<00:01:56.630> like<00:01:56.750> 16<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.140> got<00:01:57.290> my<00:01:57.470> first<00:01:57.620> job<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.130> was

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
was like 16 I got my first job and I was

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.070 
was like 16 I got my first job and I was
actually<00:01:58.340> making<00:01:58.580> money<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:59.210> could<00:01:59.840> go<00:01:59.960> out

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
actually making money I could go out

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.560 
actually making money I could go out
before<00:02:00.230> like<00:02:00.680> any<00:02:01.040> hambar<00:02:01.400> I<00:02:01.430> wanted<00:02:01.940> right

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
before like any hambar I wanted right

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.000 
before like any hambar I wanted right
and<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.080> hamburger<00:02:03.470> really<00:02:03.680> defined

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
and like the hamburger really defined

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.800 
and like the hamburger really defined
freedom<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.580> America<00:02:05.120> I've<00:02:05.300> always<00:02:05.600> said<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
freedom in America I've always said the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.080 
freedom in America I've always said the
hamburger<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.380> triumph<00:02:06.830> over<00:02:07.090> everything

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
hamburger is a triumph over everything

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.580 
hamburger is a triumph over everything
got<00:02:08.209> bigger<00:02:08.420> right<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.170> everything's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
got bigger right and everything's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.990 
got bigger right and everything's
getting<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.830> little<00:02:09.979> bit<00:02:10.070> smaller<00:02:10.340> what's

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
getting a little bit smaller what's

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240 
getting a little bit smaller what's
interesting<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.540> taco<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.350> it's

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
interesting that the taco is like it's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.370 
interesting that the taco is like it's
eminently<00:02:13.610> modern<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.510> there's<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.200> great

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
eminently modern and there's a great

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.050 
eminently modern and there's a great
sense<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> modernity<00:02:16.070> about<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> sense

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
sense of modernity about it in the sense

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.090 
sense of modernity about it in the sense
that<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.330> involved<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:18.830> actually

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
that it's involved now but it's actually

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.430 
that it's involved now but it's actually
an<00:02:19.190> ancient<00:02:19.400> form<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.000> food<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
an ancient form of food and and the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.140 
an ancient form of food and and the
handbook<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.130> modern<00:02:22.489> object<00:02:22.910> but

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
handbook that it's a modern object but

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.110 
handbook that it's a modern object but
maybe<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.050> an<00:02:24.110> object<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.970> despite<00:02:25.970> its

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
maybe it's an object that despite its

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.880 
maybe it's an object that despite its
modernity<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:26.810> almost<00:02:27.080> at<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.290> end<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.739> its

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
modernity it's almost at the end of its

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.770 
modernity it's almost at the end of its
range<00:02:28.130> maybe<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.670> should<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.030> once<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.600> week

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
range maybe it should be a once a week

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.330 
range maybe it should be a once a week

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
gonna see as time goes on that pork is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.540 
gonna see as time goes on that pork is
gonna<00:02:47.660> start<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.050> catch<00:02:48.260> up<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.370> so

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
gonna start to catch up what is so

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.070 
gonna start to catch up what is so
fundamentally<00:02:50.209> important<00:02:50.570> about<00:02:50.720> both<00:02:50.930> of

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
fundamentally important about both of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.330 
fundamentally important about both of
these<00:02:51.170> dishes<00:02:51.410> yeah<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.010> only<00:02:52.130> way

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
these dishes yeah I think the only way

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.970 
these dishes yeah I think the only way
is<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.670> get<00:02:53.030> someone<00:02:53.239> that's<00:02:53.390> absolutely<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is to get someone that's absolutely so

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.460 
is to get someone that's absolutely so
