controller isn't final but it still
feels<00:01:38.310> quite<00:01:38.820> good<00:01:38.880> I'd<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.840> doesn't<00:01:40.020> have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
feels quite good I'd say it doesn't have

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
feels quite good I'd say it doesn't have
the<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:40.829> premium<00:01:41.430> luxury<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.000> you'd<00:01:42.090> maybe

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the same premium luxury that you'd maybe

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.510 
the same premium luxury that you'd maybe
get<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> Xbox<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.950> something<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
get from like the Xbox or something but

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
get from like the Xbox or something but
it<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:45.180> cheaper<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.960> bear<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.409> mind

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it is a lot cheaper so bear that in mind

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
it is a lot cheaper so bear that in mind
it's<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:47.970> story<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> games

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's the same story with the games

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
it's the same story with the games
they're<00:01:49.140> cheap<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.189> obviously

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
they're cheap which is good obviously

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
they're cheap which is good obviously
but<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.450> some

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
but there are going to be some

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
but there are going to be some
franchises<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.920> only<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.310> coming<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
franchises that will only be coming to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.950 
franchises that will only be coming to
the<00:01:53.759> high<00:01:53.909> powered<00:01:54.299> consoles<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.810> you're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the high powered consoles that you're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.709 
the high powered consoles that you're
unlikely<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.549> game<00:01:56.759> stick<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.689> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
unlikely to see on the game stick so I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
unlikely to see on the game stick so I
think<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.409> probably<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.009> system<00:01:59.369> that's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
think this is probably a system that's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
think this is probably a system that's
going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.060> casual<00:02:00.570> gamers<00:02:01.049> or

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
going to be for more casual gamers or

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
going to be for more casual gamers or
people<00:02:01.740> who<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.009> want<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> blow<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.700> steam
