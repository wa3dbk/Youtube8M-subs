just sit back and got my job done at

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.660 
just sit back and got my job done at
that<00:02:17.650> time<00:02:18.010> let's<00:02:18.460> see<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.640> think<00:02:18.880> my<00:02:19.300> goal<00:02:19.660> was

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that time let's see I think my goal was

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750 
that time let's see I think my goal was
maybe<00:02:21.780> 40<00:02:22.780> or<00:02:22.840> 50<00:02:23.080> dollars<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.130> worth<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
maybe 40 or 50 dollars it was worth and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.960 
maybe 40 or 50 dollars it was worth and
then<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:26.470> silver<00:02:26.800> dollar<00:02:27.010> was<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.520> think<00:02:27.730> six

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
then the silver dollar was I think six

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.260 
then the silver dollar was I think six
or<00:02:28.060> seven<00:02:28.390> dollars<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.890> I've<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:31.030> made

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
or seven dollars and so I've really made

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.330 
or seven dollars and so I've really made
out<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.660> them<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.320> he<00:02:32.530> made<00:02:32.740> out<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.010> that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
out on them and he made out on that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.120 
out on them and he made out on that
because<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:34.000> he<00:02:34.300> doesn't<00:02:34.570> have<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> pay<00:02:35.130> taxes

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
because see he doesn't have to pay taxes

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.960 
because see he doesn't have to pay taxes
on<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.370> money

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
on that money

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
on that money
he<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.020> tell<00:02:38.230> his<00:02:38.350> wife<00:02:38.380> about

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
he doesn't have to tell his wife about

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.870 
he doesn't have to tell his wife about
that<00:02:39.250> money<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:42.190> know<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> was<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.760> in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
his little free time so then he made a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.449 
his little free time so then he made a
little<00:02:44.800> extra<00:02:45.190> money

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
little extra money

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.400

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
gold and silver start about half price

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.400 
gold and silver start about half price
and<00:02:56.770> then<00:02:57.520> with<00:02:58.270> about<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> half<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.110> price

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.900 
and then with about the half the price
and<00:02:59.860> then<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.160> might<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.580> go<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> little

coins<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.360> show<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.049> date<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.160> think<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.670> can

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
coins to show the date I think you can

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.229 
coins to show the date I think you can
see<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> date<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.540> there<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:41.940> 1917<00:03:43.739> 1885<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
see the date on there in 1917 1885 and

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.390 
see the date on there in 1917 1885 and
that's<00:03:46.810> because<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.620> one<00:03:47.830> here<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.250> looks

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's because this one here it looks

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.490 
that's because this one here it looks

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
take the coins and imagine where they

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.370

this<00:04:30.699> is<00:04:30.940> bullion<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:34.060> packaged<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.750> myself

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
this is bullion and I packaged it myself

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.480 
this is bullion and I packaged it myself
I<00:04:35.380> printed<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.860> up<00:04:36.039> on<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.430> on<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.840> computer

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
I printed it up on the on the computer

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.939 
I printed it up on the on the computer
and<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:40.539> makes<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.080> look<00:04:41.229> like<00:04:41.259> it's<00:04:41.590> worth<00:04:41.800> a

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
and it makes it look like it's worth a

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.320 
and it makes it look like it's worth a
little<00:04:42.099> more<00:04:42.430> but<00:04:42.669> it's<00:04:42.789> still<00:04:42.820> worth<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
little more but it's still worth the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.170 
little more but it's still worth the
same<00:04:43.509> as<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.870> one<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:45.190> that's<00:04:45.639> why<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.820> do<00:04:46.030> it

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
same as that one but that's why I do it

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.490 
same as that one but that's why I do it
like<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.479> just<00:04:46.930> kind<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.199> makes<00:04:47.349> it<00:04:47.440> look

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
like that just kind of makes it look

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.770 
like that just kind of makes it look
better<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.370> don't<00:04:48.610> forget<00:04:48.910> what<00:04:49.150> we're<00:04:49.389> what

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
sixty dollars each so but you don't look

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.350 
sixty dollars each so but you don't look
at<00:06:21.229> them<00:06:21.410> as<00:06:21.560> dollars<00:06:22.130> because<00:06:22.970> when<00:06:23.240> the

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
at them as dollars because when the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.820 
at them as dollars because when the
dollar<00:06:23.600> collapses<00:06:24.639> these<00:06:25.639> will<00:06:25.970> have<00:06:26.150> worth

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
dollar collapses these will have worth

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.930 
dollar collapses these will have worth
we<00:06:27.830> don't<00:06:27.979> know<00:06:28.130> what's<00:06:28.520> gonna<00:06:28.639> happen<00:06:28.729> with

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940

have<00:06:30.889> Worth<00:06:31.160> and<00:06:31.370> that's<00:06:32.030> why<00:06:32.240> any

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
have Worth and that's why any

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.980 
have Worth and that's why any
professional<00:06:33.669> would<00:06:34.669> rather<00:06:35.120> have<00:06:35.479> gold<00:06:35.810> and
