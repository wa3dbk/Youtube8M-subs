 [music] 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.529
 hello friends with you petrovsky then 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 we are at the Geneva Motor Show on the stand 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.610
 the country house which as you know 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 enters the ren group in Geneva 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.400
 the world premiere of the new 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 compact van 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 cottage loggia which is now 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 in front of me this compact along with it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 spacious car with a length of 4 s 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.379
 half a meter personify according to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 cottages all the fun and the most 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.049
 useful that can be squeezed out of the minivan 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 which host either 5 or even 7 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.470
 man and fits big enough 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.049
 amount of cargo 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.510
 a lot of air a lot of space and above your head 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.820
 and on the side of a particular, we now have 5 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.619
 local version with a giant boot in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.229
 this version in this version it 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.000
 has a volume of about 700 liters interesting 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.369
 that many trim elements in particular 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 Here is the incomplete lining of the back 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.549
 panels are such a pen on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 plastic pocket just yet 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.150
 Duster characteristic 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.070
 and repeats in many ways constructive this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.619
 compact crossover as for 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.500
 better then he has enough 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.880
 unassuming but at the same time 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 interesting design that can not be called 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.049
 very catchy but at the same time from 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.789
 the car in the crowd will not be lost 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 as for the salon, everything is here 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.770
 quite ascetic it is such a team 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.719
 hodgepodge of all models of the market and in general 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 and villas that you can imagine 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.679
 for example, this visor is very similar to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 conga this is the most 2 de new tape recorder 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.299
 exactly the same now 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 installed on our market duster even 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.130
 Here are these climate twists 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.689
 Absolutely similar to a duster a little 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.179
 Refreshes the situation only in such 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 two-color finish in some places 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.229
 beige front panel and then 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.030
 some gray but plastic 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.810
 tough enough 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.710
 however, it should be noted that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.109
 the air space in the cabin is very 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 a lot of me with my height meter seventy 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.020
 two 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.630
 probably still 30 centimeters for the ceiling 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 I have a stock and this is the high ceiling 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 he goes actually to the end of the salon then 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.929
 there are all the same four and a half 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.670
 meters meter of which 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.440
 refers to the front of the car to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.480
 engine compartment but here it is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.240
 about three meters long indeed 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.890
 it is very spacious and now 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.490
 we have a budget version of longines 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.410
 example here 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.870
 manual rear windows 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.700
 just twist the corresponding knobs 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.340
 for example this central console 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.319
 here has just kai niche deepening 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.450
 Now we move to more expensive 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.320
 versions let's see how it differs 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.320
 [music] 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.640
 but actually it has this version 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.780
 already seven seats rear parking sensors more 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.450
 richly electric 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.340
 interior trim and richer 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.709
 finishing materials so appeared here 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.390
 more chrome now center console 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.940
 finished in such a black glossy 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.150
 Plastic noticeable that appeared 2 din 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 new cassette touch 7-inch 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.650
 which display is displayed in general 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.930
 a lot of information including navigation 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.970
 but what is worth noting is that even 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530
 on the most expensive versions did not appear 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.970
 climate control after all loggia it 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.280
 very budget car in general 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.200
 budget climate control knobs and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.810
 A / C button here 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.819
 remains pure mechanical but should 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.890
 note that the very niche that was 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.540
 in the middle of the center console more 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.220
 the cheap version here has turned 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.190
 fairly functional glove box with 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.440
 cover but the most important difference of this 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.799
 version of the lot is that it is 7-seater and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.019
 here in the trunk and there are still nicknames 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.849
 folding sofa that can be opened 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.079
 or close by i must now 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.390
 show how it works 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.340
 the trunk has almost the same capacity 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.549
 but maybe a little less than 5 local 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.420
 versions if we need to open this one 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.290
 the third row 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.700
 this is done as follows 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.290
 one seat reclines and 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.630
 respectively in the same way a friend and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.239
 Moreover, it can be noted that the trunk is here 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.819
 actually killed that is well 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.730
 literally centimeters probably 30 20-30 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.410
 centimeters to the cap but sit on 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.030
 these same seats in principle 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.549
 quite comfortable here is even 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.980
 molded cup holders in the sides 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.230
 and distance for legs well, in principle 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.299
 enough to 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.310
 accommodate even an adult and 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.229
 there is such a rising 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.270
 head restraints except there in rich 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.080
 picking from the same three rear appear 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
 parking sensors 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.820
 and the most interesting thing here is the rear 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.639
 window if on a cheap modification it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.039
 just completely drowned it out here from 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.470
 Salon, you can open the window and make 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.720
 here is such a five centimeter 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.400
 vent to 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.570
 air the inside of the car 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.729
 Well, now let's go to the most important thing 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.550
 this is to the cost I will immediately speak in 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.070
 understandable for 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.530
 With money this Russia thous on Russian 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.660
 rubles so here is the cheapest version of the lodge 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.850
 in Europe costs about 400 thousand rubles 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.550
 This is the most expensive family local 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.040
 about 480 imagine what the 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.090
 that kind of money is naturally nothing close 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.840
 especially in the seven-seater 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.550
 minivans found in Europe almost 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.290
 unreal in this case the cottage plays on 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.080
 offering its field cheap and 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.910
 pretty sander suggesting a completely 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680
 incredible will give again for your 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.270
 price segment four by four for 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.550
 you all know what kind of advertising 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.750
 campaign he is now sold we have 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.030
 the likelihood that the lodges 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.160
 after some time will appear in Russia 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.740
 this will set a certain fashion on 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.810
 cheap roomy and very practical 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.670
 minivans, thanks for watching us 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.060
 See us and further all the best to
