00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.830
 Hi, I want to talk a little about 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.650
 Fashion make-up in front of us is very bright 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.900
 stylish but absolutely not fashionable makeup 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.240
 meanwhile hundreds of thousands and maybe 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.860
 even millions of girls still consider 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.390
 its actual this makeup is really 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.580
 was fashionable but two seasons ago now 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.400
 bright red lips so-called spring 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.050
 and clearly defined eyebrows are a bit darker 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.730
 natural hair color 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.070
 and even two tones have long been not 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.679
 relevant if it's your style 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.870
 you are ready to carry that image you can 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.699
 apply under makeup every day 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.469
 but if you think this is trendy 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.170
 makeup and so you have it on yourself 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.559
 copy play every day we 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.940
 Immediately believe it is not fashionable makeup 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 bright red lips and tightly defined 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 brows more 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.489
 I take a pencil light blond who 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.399
 I pick up almost to match the hair 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.289
 softly emphasize the eyebrows while laying them down 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.610
 using wax so they 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.399
 acquired a natural form 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.100
 natural texture and fashion 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.500
 eyebrows are well enough emphasized but 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.450
 your natural color is good at 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.210
 this is structured i mean i 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.590
 I emphasize 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.369
 and upper and lower brow line 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.659
 but I do not do this very head heart 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.659
 tail all for a month 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.300
 This season's next fashion trend is 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.390
 graphic i'm eyeliner actually 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.610
 ordinary classic eyeliner is not too 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.070
 Actually I will show how to do it because 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.320
 that in any case approach this trendy 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.970
 makeup item moreover eyeliner 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.160
 can be very easy and just literally 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.410
 emphasize beautiful in one movement 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.330
 eye shape and make up in general 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.619
 complete how to do it now 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.670
 show you step by step 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.920
 but before you make the liner 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 use the corrector or the basis 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.410
 readings to even the ages 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.380
 and prepare it for liner 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.450
 except in order to make eyeliner 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.729
 you will need either classic 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.220
 eyeliner with a brush or eyeliner here with 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.930
 so thin enough applicator in 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.510
 In this case, the eyeliner will turn out especially 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.130
 clear and contrast there is an option for 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.440
 those who have no eyeliner 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.690
 too good that is for beginners i 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 would advise just such an eyeliner in 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 jar and brush and classic tassel 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.010

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.540
 This season are relevant colored liner I 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.549
 Now I will do black because it 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.049
 however, the most significant option 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.000
 this season you are the husband do the eyeliner 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.549
 completely different shades from 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.340
 bright green bright purple bright blue 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.200
 yes even bright fuchsia then you will 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.970
 especially true of course eyeliner in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.070
 make up is like a little black dress 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.140
 in the wardrobe of a woman she should be 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.080
 absolutely everyone that is now I will 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.880
 do the classic base arrow 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.560
 down here there are very important rules for 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.510
 order to make a good even 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.950
 eyeliner first need to take 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.100
 the correct position take the female 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.660
 mirror chin up and look 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.760
 a bit down on myself 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.740
 note that a century in this case 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.630
 is in a tense state and 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.870
 you will see all the errors that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.650
 maybe you can here next very 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.010
 important moment 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 position of the brush please see us 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.940
 don't close our eyes because if you 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.459
 close your eyes and the eyelid will come together and 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.890
 eyeliner will fall on all these uneven 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.760
 folds in this case the liner will not 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.510
 too neat 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.100
 It is also very important to put eyeliner and 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.100
 only then start the movement 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.980
 for classic shooters there are simple 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.349
 rules rule number one arrow 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.739
 should always be thinner at the inside 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.900
 angle of the eye and wider in appearance and one more 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.670
 very important rule arrow need 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.930
 do in the vicinity of 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.790
 eyelash growth line 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.860
 if after you hit the arrow 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.099
 you see the gap between the ciliary 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.319
 the outline and the arrow itself you know 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.390
 did crimes against shooters and 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.400
 you urgently need to fill 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.810
 using eyeliner and to this 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.130
 sometimes it's easy enough 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.990
 lift the chin to deploy 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.200
 reverse applicator start 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.200
 lead the arrow from the outer corner of the eye and 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.790
 finish off at the same time 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.930

 they can be very easy to make super mega 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.310
 fashionable arrows use very 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.290
 bright pencil and there is no need 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.810
 yourself not how to limit this season 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.520
 colored arrows are acutely relevant you 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.080
 You can even choose a bright function when 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.870
 this eye will never look 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.850
 sore or tearful if clear 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.430
 black arrows already present along 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.080
 ciliated along the way that one i take 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.570
 bright kuksi pencil 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.820
 and put it just on top of a bright black 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.690
 arrows at the same time will not repeat the well 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.050
 form
