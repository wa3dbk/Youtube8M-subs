dragon city we already seen this island

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
dragon city we already seen this island
before<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.640> Viking<00:00:21.300> island<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
before but it is the Viking island and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.340 
before but it is the Viking island and
you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.609> already<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> video<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.900> these

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you know we already did a video on these

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.099 
you know we already did a video on these
dragon<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.279> Thor<00:00:26.580> Loki<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.390> Odin

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
dragon which is Thor Loki and Odin

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
dragon which is Thor Loki and Odin
except<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> only<00:00:29.279> thing<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.760> didn't<00:00:30.090> do

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
except the only thing that we didn't do

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.770 
except the only thing that we didn't do
is<00:00:30.769> that<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:33.390> battle<00:00:33.809> videos<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.410> Loki<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
is that the battle videos for Loki and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.090 
is that the battle videos for Loki and
Odin<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.620> Odin<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> missing<00:00:38.520> but

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
Odin I think Odin is missing but

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
Odin I think Odin is missing but
essentially<00:00:41.100> everything<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.910> probably<00:00:42.540> still

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
essentially everything is probably still

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.590 
essentially everything is probably still
very<00:00:43.440> similar<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.280> exactly<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.329> maybe

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
very similar or exactly the same maybe

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
very similar or exactly the same maybe
we'll<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.410> another<00:00:46.760> battle<00:00:47.760> video<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
we'll make another battle video to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.660 
we'll make another battle video to
ensure<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.980> there's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> same

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
ensure that there's going to be the same

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
ensure that there's going to be the same
dragon<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.750> ahead<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.410> actually

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
dragon so you can get ahead and actually

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.750 
dragon so you can get ahead and actually
beat<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.219> dragon<00:00:53.640> before<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.860> event<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> over

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
beat the dragon before the event is over

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
beat the dragon before the event is over
but<00:00:57.210> anyways<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.920> want

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
but anyways that is about it just want

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
but anyways that is about it just want
to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.640> news<00:01:00.000> video<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.079> island

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to do a little news video on this island

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
to do a little news video on this island
that<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.980> came<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.449> missed<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that just came out and if you missed it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.560 
that just came out and if you missed it
the<00:01:04.260> first<00:01:04.290> time<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:05.090> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> probably

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the first time around this is probably

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
the first time around this is probably
not<00:01:07.790> another<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.060> chance<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.350> miss<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
not another good chance to miss it so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
not another good chance to miss it so
you<00:01:11.100> should<00:01:11.520> definitely<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:12.299> miss<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.960> you

you should definitely not miss it you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
you should definitely not miss it you
should<00:01:13.439> try<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.330> when

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
should try to get it I don't know when

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.030 
should try to get it I don't know when
it's<00:01:15.630> coming<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.320> might<00:01:16.409> come<00:01:16.680> back<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
it's coming back it might come back I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's coming back it might come back I
don't<00:01:17.220> remember<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.150> remember

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
don't remember I don't even remember

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560 
don't remember I don't even remember
when<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> came<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:21.509> i

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
when it came out actually i think all i

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.530 
when it came out actually i think all i
remember<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> Viking<00:01:23.909> island<00:01:24.299> came

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
remember was when the Viking island came

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.050 
remember was when the Viking island came
out<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.460> first<00:01:27.080> three

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
out it was actually the first three

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
out it was actually the first three
dragon<00:01:30.060> event<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> how<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.380> event<00:01:31.740> work

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
dragon event so how the event work

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.670 
dragon event so how the event work
before<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.079> dragons<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
before was that there's two dragons you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
before was that there's two dragons you
can<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.130> dragons<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> left<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
can get two dragons one on the left and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
can get two dragons one on the left and
one<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.130> started<00:01:38.490> with

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
one on the right but they started with

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.830 
one on the right but they started with
these<00:01:38.909> three<00:01:40.340> three<00:01:41.340> dragons<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.299> habitat

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
these three three dragons and a habitat

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.910 
these three three dragons and a habitat
so<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> remember<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> first<00:01:46.619> time

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so all I remember is that the first time

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.359 
so all I remember is that the first time
they<00:01:47.100> made<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.479> Viking<00:01:49.200> island<00:01:49.799> but

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
they made this was the Viking island but

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
they made this was the Viking island but
we're<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.850> today<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:51.509> actually<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> guess

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
we're back today again actually I guess

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
we're back today again actually I guess
I<00:01:52.920> could<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.310> check<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> alright<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.810> let<00:01:55.259> me

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I could go check on it alright so let me

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.209 
I could go check on it alright so let me
check<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:57.380> viking<00:01:58.549> island<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:01.219> usually

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
check on it viking island and usually

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.289 
check on it viking island and usually
there<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:03.270> video<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.740> already<00:02:05.299> alright

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
there is a video on it already alright

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.690 
there is a video on it already alright
so<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.680> released<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.369> februari<00:02:09.289> 26<00:02:10.700> 2014

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so it was released on februari 26 2014

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.010 
so it was released on februari 26 2014
so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.810 
so
you'll<00:02:13.530> probably<00:02:13.740> have<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> wait<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.550> two

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
you'll probably have to wait one two

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.360 
you'll probably have to wait one two
three<00:02:15.240> four<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.140> maybe<00:02:16.470> somewhere<00:02:16.830> are<00:02:17.010> five

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
three four so maybe somewhere are five

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.310 
three four so maybe somewhere are five
six<00:02:17.790> months<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.840> it'll<00:02:19.050> come<00:02:19.290> back

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320
