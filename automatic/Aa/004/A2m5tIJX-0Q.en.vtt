00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
know this is all just scrap wood that

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.010 
know this is all just scrap wood that
I'm<00:01:04.739> using<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.400> each<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.300> is<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.480> third<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'm using but each one is a third of a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'm using but each one is a third of a
cord<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.040> Rick<00:01:08.430> or<00:01:08.760> face<00:01:09.120> cord<00:01:09.480> whatever<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
cord or a Rick or face cord whatever you

cord or a Rick or face cord whatever you
want<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.230> call<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.610> three<00:01:11.880> pallets

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
want to call it so these three pallets

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.330 
want to call it so these three pallets
right<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.690> will<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.930> enough<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.560> one

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
right here will be enough to get me one

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.780 
right here will be enough to get me one
quart<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> firewood<00:01:15.270> stacked<00:01:16.399> this<00:01:17.399> is<00:01:17.579> what<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
quart of firewood stacked this is what I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.510 
quart of firewood stacked this is what I
moved<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.630> firewood<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.409> among<00:01:19.829> many<00:01:20.280> other

moved my firewood with among many other

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
moved my firewood with among many other
things<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
things but this is probably one of the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
things but this is probably one of the
favorite<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
favorite things I do with it this is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.880 
favorite things I do with it this is
actually<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> mast<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.579> a<00:01:26.670> forklift<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.890> was

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actually a mast from a forklift that was

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
actually a mast from a forklift that was
cut<00:01:29.820> off<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.380> where<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
cut off you can see back here where it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
cut off you can see back here where it
was<00:01:31.860> cut<00:01:32.040> off<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.689> modified<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.719> fit<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
was cut off and modified to fit a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.649 
was cut off and modified to fit a
three-point<00:01:34.619> hitch<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> tractor<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.479> can

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
three-point hitch on a tractor you can

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.319 
three-point hitch on a tractor you can
buy<00:01:36.840> pallet<00:01:37.409> lifts<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.430> three-point<00:01:39.119> hitch

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
buy pallet lifts for a three-point hitch

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.300 
buy pallet lifts for a three-point hitch
they're<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.810> quite<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.289> nice<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> these

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they're not quite as nice as this these

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
they're not quite as nice as this these
Forks<00:01:42.299> pivot<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.810> slides<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.469> bit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Forks pivot and slides a little bit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
Forks pivot and slides a little bit
easier<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> tractor<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
easier to get in with a tractor you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.209 
easier to get in with a tractor you
don't<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.960> quite<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> maneuverability

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
don't have quite the maneuverability

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't have quite the maneuverability
that<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> forklift<00:01:48.390> does<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.430> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that a forklift does so this is what I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:34.729 
that a forklift does so this is what I
use<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> move<00:01:51.060> it

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739
