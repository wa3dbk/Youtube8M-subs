00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.120
 If there is no're Holy Munosasakure for lease 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.120
 I will wear it 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:33.500
 Take all the belts to be built and pay attention to the height and direction of the tank head and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:36.250
 This ecstatic spot is coming out and it's about the same height 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.250
 I was advancing 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.810
 Huh there 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.020
 It only pulls the soul 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.080
 I have only this with my hand 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.490
 It looks like the end of the belt 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.640
 Flying in the house while wearing a finger care 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.640
 Good 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520
 It just doesn't close 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.299
 Look at the pond 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.299
 If you pull here first, pull it on the left but please stand 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.020
 Yes, through the belt if it is the end 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.500
 I think it's a good thing 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.840
 It is as if I was a couple from 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.840
 Make sure that if there are any color 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.400
 Yes regulator to the next 0 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:48.070
 Because out of the regulator has come second stage from Japan right 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.120
 The second stage is often in Japan Screw is my navel is it 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.820
 That's right that way 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.820
 Remove the dust cap by loosening carefully, screening 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.909
 There according to the place of the o-ring of the tank 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.149
 It is good enough to tighten with three fingers 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 Oh, let's keep going 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.570
 It is the number of people coming out from the left Take one hose with nothing attached 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.570
 Let's attach with the inflator hose 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.700
 It is a short hole if there are three 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.860
 And I heard defeated the Chuä¹ƒheard since has become a coupler 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.860
 Ok if you can not pull 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.060
 Inflator force and medium pressure broadcast that one 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.760
 And it was stopped even at the Velcro belt 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 Because it is easy travel 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.879
 p Well then it was not an 8 valve 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.950
 All installation is complete but before installation 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.629
 Thank you 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.620
 There were two things I wanted to check before opening the valve. The first was the second stage. 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.220
 For example, if you hate logs, it's funny, but I'll make sure it's dead 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.240
 I will 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.240
 It is water but it is water 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.830
 Put the meat and let's check both 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.230
 Next, if you try to add a mountain, if you make a residual pressure gauge 100 even though you do not have a log 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.180
 It is wierd, is not it 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.350
 The valve you were Why all right to check that the needle say Datte zero points to the 0 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.350
 Please open slowly 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.170
 Want I think also from 1 to say that the left hand 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.440
 I will go back a bit if I open it all 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:05.590
 Please check if there is more than 180 in the incoming moon month 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:08.590
 Is there a mountain and I can't breathe air from the second stage this time 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:15.660
 Put on c because there is no c 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.660
 And if you press the par 4 button, please also say that the air comes out 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.240
 ok yes ok it's ok with this 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.320
 If it is good, it will be until bc becomes bread 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.220
 It is up to blinded to please or kitchen knife prevention valve is actuated 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.220
 Recruitment 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.310
 It is a system early, for example, if you go to the bathroom and come back as it is 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:57.010
 If you say that it is squeezed , you can see that bc something is wrong 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.180
 Yes Please confirm also say that sure whether swell to overflowing in that sense 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.420
 This is the setting 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.350
 It's ok 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.350
