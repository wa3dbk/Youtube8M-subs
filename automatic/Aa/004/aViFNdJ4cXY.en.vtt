00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello everyone, today I am going to recommend a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 book that I think you'll like for 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.059
 this time of year that is summer over 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 everything here in Spain we in other countries 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.209
 It is very hot and I want to recommend you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.690
 a book for this time of year so 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.690
 hot 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.450
 this book is happiness must be 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 something like Jennifer and smith is a 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.200
 author that I already tried with another book that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 I'll leave you here and the truth is that I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 it looks like a book like this 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.580
 refreshing cool that would be very fast 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.420
 and as in summer it's hot we become 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.680
 a bit lazy and do not want so much 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.720
 read or at least to me maybe to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 others with more time catch him more 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.330
 like reading 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.160
 that's why I recommend this book and 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.040
 also takes place at this time of year 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 in summer and we get more in the book 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.830
 because it's hot is a little village 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.720
 small with a beach one a 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.030
 very good atmosphere to read this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.920
 summer and I tell my story that is 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 quite simple as you can appreciate 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.650
 for the cover and for the title is a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.619
 romantic youth history but it does not arrive 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 to be much less or cloying mime and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.600
 sweetie is a pretty pretty story 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.159
 that at first you have a lot of fun 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 because it has some encounters 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.760
 pretty funny couple is about a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.940
 girl who lives in a small village 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.460
 and suddenly for an event starts to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.830
 receive emails 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.220
 To communicate with a boy you do not know 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.500
 of nothing until that boy reaches his 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.200
 town and see that it is a famous star 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.720
 of cinema that is going to shoot a movie in 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.330
 your locality and from here starts to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.580
 grow the feelings to create a 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.070
 plot and although it seems like it's a bit 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.229
 chubby because it reaches 400 pages 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.670
 I tell you that it reads very very fast 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.950
 I recommend that for this time of 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 year and if you give a chance I hope that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.810
