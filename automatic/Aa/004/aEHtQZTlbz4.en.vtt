00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
alright so as you guys can see this is

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.900 
alright so as you guys can see this is
the<00:03:20.570> case<00:03:20.900> as<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.650> guys<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:22.010> see<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.250> cutout

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
the case as you guys can see the cutout

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.090 
the case as you guys can see the cutout
of<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.180> camera<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.239> see<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
of a camera but you can see that the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.850 
of a camera but you can see that the
camera<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.130> still<00:03:28.880> not<00:03:29.600> well<00:03:30.019> protected<00:03:30.620> by<00:03:30.800> it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
camera is still not well protected by it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.300 
camera is still not well protected by it
so<00:03:31.370> maybe<00:03:31.519> this<00:03:31.820> one<00:03:32.120> disadvantage<00:03:33.040> if<00:03:34.040> I

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
so maybe this one disadvantage if I

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.210 
so maybe this one disadvantage if I
don't<00:03:34.970> mind<00:03:35.209> because<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.630> like<00:03:35.959> clean<00:03:36.680> cases

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
don't mind because I like clean cases

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.960 
don't mind because I like clean cases
and<00:03:37.489> also<00:03:37.790> there's<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:39.670> perfect<00:03:40.670> cutout<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
and also there's a perfect cutout of the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.110 
and also there's a perfect cutout of the
lodging<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.209> also<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.840> heat<00:03:45.200> Jack<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.760> also

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120
