in<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.850> panel<00:03:16.150> itself<00:03:16.390> about<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.230> only<00:03:17.410> wood

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
in the panel itself about the only wood

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.410 
in the panel itself about the only wood
that<00:03:17.920> really<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.460> there<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.880> bottom<00:03:19.210> plate

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
that really is in there the bottom plate

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.630 
that really is in there the bottom plate
the<00:03:19.930> top<00:03:20.170> plate<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.650> some<00:03:21.400> occasional

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
the top plate and some occasional

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
framing around the windows and doors and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.470 
framing around the windows and doors and
what<00:03:23.560> kind<00:03:23.740> of<00:03:23.800> trees<00:03:24.040> are<00:03:24.070> used<00:03:24.400> uh<00:03:24.970> what<00:03:25.360> they

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
what kind of trees are used uh what they

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.180 
what kind of trees are used uh what they
do<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:25.840> actually<00:03:25.930> have<00:03:26.140> poplar<00:03:26.740> farms

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
do is they actually have poplar farms

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.340 
do is they actually have poplar farms
and<00:03:27.400> they<00:03:28.030> use<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.450> poplar<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.960> chip<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> up

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
and they use the poplar and chip it up

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.690 
and they use the poplar and chip it up
into<00:03:29.560> wafers<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:30.040> make<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.250> panels<00:03:30.550> with

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
into wafers and make the panels with

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.010 
into wafers and make the panels with
it's<00:03:30.850> very<00:03:31.060> very<00:03:31.270> little<00:03:31.390> lumber<00:03:31.690> that's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
it's very very little lumber that's

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.390 
it's very very little lumber that's
important<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> lot<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.740> our<00:03:32.890> viewers<00:03:33.280> it

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
important to a lot of our viewers it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.980 
important to a lot of our viewers it
certainly<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:34.270> we<00:03:34.330> go<00:03:34.450> inside<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.840> take<00:03:34.960> a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
certainly is can we go inside and take a

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.160 
certainly is can we go inside and take a
look

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
look

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.910 
look
let's<00:03:35.290> do<00:03:35.440> okay<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.630> Don<00:03:38.170> while<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> sips

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
let's do okay now Don while the sips

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.250 
let's do okay now Don while the sips
technology<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:40.060> really<00:03:40.090> bring<00:03:40.600> us<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.900> nice

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
technology can really bring us a nice

airtight home the exchange of air is
very<00:03:44.080> important<00:03:44.590> isn't<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:44.950> getting<00:03:45.160> fresh

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
very important isn't it getting fresh

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.180 
very important isn't it getting fresh

you deal with the exchange

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.730 
you deal with the exchange
I<00:03:51.340> know<00:03:51.850> six<00:03:52.270> home<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.260> two<00:03:53.470> part

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
I know six home it's really a two part

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.040 
I know six home it's really a two part
system<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.700> use<00:03:54.850> mechanical<00:03:55.360> ventilation<00:03:55.720> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
provide all of the fresh air then that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.610 
provide all of the fresh air then that
only<00:04:01.510> makes<00:04:01.750> sense<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.110> make<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.350> building

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
only makes sense to make the building

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.199 
only makes sense to make the building
envelope<00:04:02.740> as<00:04:03.100> tight<00:04:03.310> as<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.459> possibly<00:04:03.580> can

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
envelope as tight as you possibly can

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.210 
envelope as tight as you possibly can
and<00:04:04.420> that's<00:04:04.930> where<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.350> sips<00:04:05.590> come<00:04:05.770> in<00:04:05.920> really

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
and that's where the sips come in really

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.430 
and that's where the sips come in really
well<00:04:06.520> because<00:04:06.760> they<00:04:07.420> are<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:07.660> airtight<00:04:08.080> and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
well because they are so airtight and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.350 
well because they are so airtight and
energy<00:04:08.980> efficient<00:04:09.370> as<00:04:09.459> well<00:04:09.670> energy

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
energy efficient as well energy

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.180 
energy efficient as well energy
efficiency<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.780> know<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> big<00:04:11.440> factor<00:04:11.920> we'll

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
efficiency I know is a big factor we'll

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.380 
efficiency I know is a big factor we'll
talk<00:04:12.340> about<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.760> minute<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.180> let's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
talk about that in a minute but let's

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.310 
talk about that in a minute but let's
talk<00:04:13.540> about<00:04:13.600> some<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.020> other<00:04:14.140> benefits

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
talk about some of the other benefits

to build

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.760 
to build
and<00:04:20.660> as<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.840> can<00:04:20.960> tell<00:04:21.140> this<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.350> very<00:04:21.590> windy

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
and as you can tell this is very windy

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.310 
and as you can tell this is very windy
site<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.730> so<00:04:23.030> does<00:04:23.510> keep<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.200> air

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
site it is so does keep the air

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.800 
site it is so does keep the air
infiltration<00:04:24.560> down<00:04:25.070> part<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.640> how<00:04:26.360> fast<00:04:26.630> is

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
infiltration down part of it how fast is

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.210 
infiltration down part of it how fast is
it<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.020> build<00:04:27.200> can<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.590> compare<00:04:27.920> that<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.130> a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
it to build can you compare that to a

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.160 
it to build can you compare that to a
traditionally<00:04:28.760> built<00:04:28.880> stick<00:04:29.180> home<00:04:29.330> right<00:04:29.960> it

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
traditionally built stick home right it

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.840 
traditionally built stick home right it
took<00:04:30.320> us<00:04:30.440> only<00:04:30.560> about<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.800> day<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.070> build<00:04:31.370> one

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
took us only about a day to build one

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.510 
took us only about a day to build one
whole<00:04:32.030> story<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:32.980> okay<00:04:34.010> well<00:04:34.250> let's<00:04:34.400> talk

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
whole story really okay well let's talk

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.190 
whole story really okay well let's talk
about<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.820> energy<00:04:35.000> efficiency<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.050> have

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
about the energy efficiency do you have

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.940 
about the energy efficiency do you have
any<00:04:36.380> statistics<00:04:37.250> for<00:04:37.820> me<00:04:38.680> typically<00:04:39.680> six

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
any statistics for me typically six

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.540 
any statistics for me typically six

Wow<00:04:50.210> all<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.630> these<00:04:50.810> things<00:04:51.020> add<00:04:51.260> up<00:04:51.290> so<00:04:51.910> what's

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
Wow all of these things add up so what's

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.730 
Wow all of these things add up so what's
the<00:04:53.030> cost<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> lot<00:04:53.900> more<00:04:54.110> expensive<00:04:54.380> than

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
the cost is it a lot more expensive than

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.260 
the cost is it a lot more expensive than
a<00:04:54.770> stick-built<00:04:55.040> home<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.730> really<00:04:55.970> boils<00:04:56.240> down

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
a stick-built home it really boils down

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.570 
a stick-built home it really boils down
to<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:56.630> insulation<00:04:57.140> if<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.160> compare<00:04:58.430> with

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
to the insulation if you compare with

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.460 
to the insulation if you compare with
traditional<00:04:59.090> traditional<00:04:59.690> construction

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
traditional traditional construction

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.890 
traditional traditional construction
methods<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.270> only<00:05:02.420> about<00:05:02.570> two

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
methods it this is only about two

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.450 
methods it this is only about two
percent<00:05:02.930> more<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:03.800> if<00:05:03.890> you<00:05:03.980> compare<00:05:04.250> with<00:05:04.370> the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
percent more but if you compare with the

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.740 
percent more but if you compare with the
quality<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:04.910> insulation<00:05:05.270> that's<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.660> the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
quality of the insulation that's in the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.110 
quality of the insulation that's in the
sips<00:05:05.990> this<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> real<00:05:06.950> bargain<00:05:07.250> really<00:05:07.880> so

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
sips this is a real bargain really so

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.030 
sips this is a real bargain really so
with<00:05:08.480> all<00:05:08.660> these<00:05:08.870> benefits<00:05:08.930> why<00:05:09.710> don't<00:05:09.950> we

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
with all these benefits why don't we

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.160 
with all these benefits why don't we
hear<00:05:10.400> about<00:05:10.520> sips<00:05:10.880> more<00:05:11.180> frequently<00:05:11.660> well

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
hear about sips more frequently well

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.120 
hear about sips more frequently well
even<00:05:12.350> though<00:05:12.410> they've<00:05:12.590> been<00:05:12.710> around<00:05:12.890> for

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
even though they've been around for

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.650 
even though they've been around for
about<00:05:13.220> 20<00:05:13.550> years<00:05:13.580> it's<00:05:13.970> still<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> relatively

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
about 20 years it's still a relatively

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.330 
about 20 years it's still a relatively
new<00:05:14.780> technology<00:05:15.470> it's<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:15.740> not<00:05:15.890> not<00:05:16.190> that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
new technology it's just not not that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.980 
new technology it's just not not that
well-known<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.390> takes<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.690> certain
