00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.910
 hello everyone I hope you are very well and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.510
 good this time I bring you a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.220
 belgium school of belgium and gods that 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.349
 in some previous video he had said that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.840
 the one that was going to bring her but there was no 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.170
 had time with the 4-3-3 formation 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.750
 option 5 starting with the goalkeeper that 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.199
 for me there are no more options in question 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.660
 of belgium is the best 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.510
 courtois then we have defense 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.309
 right finishing a very fast defense 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.650
 90 rhythm 68 defense 69 of physique and 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.059
 left defense so manga that this 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.390
 player has a little bit that just 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.710
 leave the eve 93 of rhythm 80 of 572 of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.049
 defense 140,000 coins in play on xbox 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.110
 I do not know when it cost me a lot 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.729
 get it because there is not in the market 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.070
 but he is a player that has surprised me 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.909
 a lot goes very well left defense 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 very very fast it defends very well then 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.659
 we have a couple in the central laden 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.810
 yesterday all together with yes controls 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.999
 81 rhythm for nobody 78 rhythm 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.899
 I decided for himself this couple because 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:25.929
 it was also between company but what 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.270
 I bow with this couple it was the 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.270
 rhythm companies a little bit slower than 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.439
 these two and I liked it very much despite 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.170
 of not being very high was an 84 for 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.640
 man and I think that also an 84 for 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.799
 no one's going they 're tall but to make 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
 a central defender because for me it is not 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.689
 very high comparison of company that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.849
 is about 92 in height yes and yes badly 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.659
 I remember but still they are players who 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.520
 they go very well and that is the rhythm go 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.289
 it compensates very well the defense come back 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.689
 very well to defend are always good 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.450
 positioned very good jump very good 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.909
 physical and very good defense we have it in 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.319
 the midfield to a trident that has 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.549
 I liked it a lot and I still had to try 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.410
 had tasted fellaini there was 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.379
 tried widget I was missing for trying to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.750
 this player nainggolan and I have 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.380
 surprised of the functioning of these 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.359
 three if I thought that living live well 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.599
 because I had already tried two of these 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:31.120
 three more did not finish convincing me in 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.190
 angola had not tried it much and are 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440
 players that have surprised me about 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.079
 all fellaini I 've already brought in some 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.690
 than another previous template and I follow it 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.459
 saying does not have 65 of pace is a 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.829
 player who feels much faster 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.349
 we have wiesel on the field 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.630
 with four series of watermarks that 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.030
 They add up very well when attacking is 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
 they are more very good with the attackers and 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.139
 then we have to the platform golán that his 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.739
 this impressive area of ​​89 rhythm 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:03.700
 85 among 86 of the 88 dribbles 88 of 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.120
 physical 85 defense simply in the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.849
 midfield are three players that what 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.690
 they balance very well they have physical they have 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.090
 has a very good balance defense and 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.840
 they attack very well and defend very well 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.879
 at the time of joining the attack on 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.310
 all with widgets 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.050
 I liked it a lot I was surprised 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.060
 had the opportunity to throw some 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.129
 that another shot from outside the area with 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.799
 these players and they hit it very well not 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.950
 not so much with fellaini but with angola ni 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.140
 with widgets and finally going on with 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.500
 the offensive part of this template that 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 I think you can imagine who they are 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.849
 right end that was not me I did not 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.599
 he had completely convinced he had not 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.459
 tried so far of the cifa and looks 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.260
 I wanted to put others at the mercy 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.709
 but you can not get it in the market 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.360
 because there is not and miranda was a player 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 I repeat I had not tried it at all 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.849
 the fifa I ended up using it here because 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.060
 I had more options and a player that 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.099
 I was very surprised. I liked 88 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.049
 rhythm does not have 88 rhythm I think that 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.329
 has much more in the field of play it 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.970
 feels very much faster player 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.699
 good shot over all the definition 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.700
 excellent definition very good agility 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:26.180
 good dribble 46 is bad leg 4 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.880
 then we have from left end to 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.160
 God who more signatures left at home 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.980
 I can not say anything bad about this 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.370
 player since I have it has 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.080
 delighted whenever I can put the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.910
 left end to always pass it 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.510
 Pongo is a player who has always 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.420
 rendered 95 of 91 rhythm of peace shot 94 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.800
 of 98 dribble 77 of physicist is a 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.260
 very complete player 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.140
 I repeat that is one of the players that 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.950
 more I liked to try in this fifa in 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.710
 this version and its normal tent was very 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.970
 well and the toxic is simply is 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.810
 just a pass I liked 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.870
 much later we have mediapunta to the 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.270
 wind that this player usually me 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.850
 I use it from mc or with other templates 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.070
 especially with the Bundesliga but I wanted to 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.860
 prove it here as playmaker was 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.140
 between probable between center forward or 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.310
 midfielder inclined me more for playmaker 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.880
 because his natural position of 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.240
 midfielder 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.000
 I feared I was afraid it was me the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.240
 centrodelantero center I went to 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.280
 go down to defend a little bit more than 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.620
 normal so I bent over by 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.380
 put him as a playmaker and the truth that I 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.910
 has surprised and had not tried it 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.150
 a lot and I liked it a lot 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.930
 very fast 88 player of rhythm 95 of 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.490
 shot 98 of step 82 of physical 94 of 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.590
 dribble is a player that I repeat myself has 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.360
 liked a lot is especially the shot the 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.970
 shot in the definition and the shot that 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.640
 They are spectacular they are very good 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.200
 physical 81 is physical and to put it of 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.990
 strikers inside mediapunta goes 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.730
 excellent because they rarely reach it 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.940
 knock down rarely came to remove the 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.700
 ball and is a very agile player was very 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.470
 easy to take the players with 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.620
 this player without even the need 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.050
 to make some dribble in special 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.480
 and it's just going to be the best lava 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.580
 with inertia the control it has of 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.599
 the ball automatically made it 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.569
 the defense will be 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:43.419
 as you will see in the goals is a player 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.009
 that stands out very well that so 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:49.389
 general always goes hand in hand with the 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:52.180
 very good rhythm 88 goalkeeper 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.389
 good shot is that he is a player that 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.580
 really liked the truth is that he had 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.710
 tried very little offensive midfielder 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.169
 and testing him as a forward midfielder 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.319
 center I ended up liking a lot and I 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.669
 I think I 'll leave it as in this 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.889
 position I'm not going to finish it too 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:12.539
 testing center forward because it's 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:15.849
 one is a pass, there is no one who 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:19.000
 who compares it who who what 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:21.759
 had is a player that is very very 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.710
 well it 's a little carlos or if to me 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.419
 cost almost 700 thousand coins in the play in 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.819
 your moment right now I do not know how much 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:34.030
 neither in employment nor in what is voice is a 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:35.080
 somewhat expensive template but I do not want it 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.240
 do simply to see the 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.509
 functioning of these cock yes and I have 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.819
 liked a lot especially for those who 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.289
 want to try a special player 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:48.400
 as hazard every 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:50.949
 olano huitzil fellaini are players who 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.630
 they are very worth it, I think that here 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.729
 the only two players Carlos 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.039
 discount template are hasari and the 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:59.409
 bridge the others I think I love them very 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:02.199
 accessible and if you have the opportunity to 

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:05.469
 try them try the serious ones that I repeat 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:07.029
 how they work is very good and 

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:08.620
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:10.360
