00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.250
 The early bird catches the worm 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.290
 The German-Polish bus friendship starts at 6:49 am in Cottbus am 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.249
 Bus station 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.919
 and here the passengers can go to Guben twice a day 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.789
 There directly to change to a Polish bus to Zielona Gora 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.119
 from approx 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.880
 Ballesteros want 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.159
 Bales the teacher 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.160
 so far only four people per week drive the entire route to 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.120
 Poland 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.150
 our author 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 Password anonymous 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.350
 the bus was 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 Reinhard Brunkhorst 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 Colombo 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.060
 as the sheet reports 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.120
 there were waiting for help 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.950
 the German bus and drove up 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.810
 then that has to be Turkey 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 a demolition traffic takes over the majority 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 for the project 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.760
 what we put here with our Polish Portman and that is called 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.450
 cross-border linking of lines 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.620
 and that means ultimately two existing on traffic systems 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.850
 not only wants to link together an all-chosen 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.800
 Source destination traffic 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.130
 So these are trying to link individual lines 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 Net increasing linkage of individual lines will hump two traffic systems 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 To grow together 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.430
 Just look at the Tanner story for us 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.100
 from the left is because she is allowed Jung is that we have many small steps 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.130
 go the proceeds 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310
 I said no 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 there are in peripheral location 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.470
 in such a 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.479
 in the middle of Europe 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.259
 because I just smelled it 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.159
 really weird find exciting to know our neighbor and we 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.179
 Offer 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.229
 Environment on the other side or Polish Kremser as ours 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.229
 To tap teachers once 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.749
 whether to change from German and Polish bus to European 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.480
 history 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.580
 or European future will remain to be seen first 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.599
 surely the possibilities are there
