just<00:02:32.030> put<00:02:32.420> four<00:02:32.690> four<00:02:33.020> means<00:02:33.650> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
just put four four means of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.620 
just put four four means of
demonstration<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:34.820> see<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> little<00:02:35.450> hole

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
demonstration you see the little hole

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.840 
demonstration you see the little hole
already<00:02:35.840> forming<00:02:36.470> now<00:02:37.250> we're<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> chain

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
already forming now we're going to chain

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.730 
already forming now we're going to chain
two<00:02:38.180> again<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:41.030> two<00:02:41.300> skip<00:02:42.080> those<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
two again and one two skip those and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.090 
two again and one two skip those and
then<00:02:43.460> we're<00:02:43.610> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.530> single<00:02:45.530> crochet<00:02:45.800> to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
then we're going to single crochet to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.380 
then we're going to single crochet to
the<00:02:46.280> end<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:50.930> now<00:02:51.740> using<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:52.610> yarn<00:02:52.970> this

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the end now now using this yarn this

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.290 
the end now now using this yarn this
size<00:02:53.660> hook<00:02:54.020> on<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:55.340> buttonhole<00:02:55.940> would<00:02:56.150> be

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
size hook on this buttonhole would be

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.830 
size hook on this buttonhole would be
good<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:56.900> maybe<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.290> button<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.340> inch

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
good for maybe a button that's one inch

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.310 
good for maybe a button that's one inch
to<00:02:59.840> maybe<00:03:00.170> one<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.280> quarter<00:03:01.520> inch<00:03:02.080> maybe<00:03:03.080> one

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
to maybe one in a quarter inch maybe one

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.810 
to maybe one in a quarter inch maybe one
and<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.500> half<00:03:03.620> inch<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:04.220> really<00:03:04.520> nice<00:03:04.670> to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
and a half inch if it's really nice to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.790 
and a half inch if it's really nice to
stretch<00:03:05.090> your<00:03:05.240> yarn<00:03:05.480> if<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.260> have<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.440> bigger

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
stretch your yarn if you have a bigger

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.770 
stretch your yarn if you have a bigger
button<00:03:07.160> let's<00:03:07.490> say<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> two<00:03:08.120> inch<00:03:08.330> button

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
button let's say a two inch button

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
button let's say a two inch button
you're<00:03:08.930> obviously<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> want<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.130> to

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
you're obviously going to want to go to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.010 
you're obviously going to want to go to
three<00:03:10.730> or<00:03:10.850> four<00:03:11.300> skipped<00:03:12.230> stitches<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.100> to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
three or four skipped stitches and to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.890 
three or four skipped stitches and to
say<00:03:15.020> make<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.290> three<00:03:15.620> or<00:03:15.650> four<00:03:15.770> chains<00:03:16.900> this

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
say make it three or four chains this

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.660 
say make it three or four chains this
number<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.500> change<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:19.010> make<00:03:19.190> should<00:03:19.430> always

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
number of change you make should always

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.750 
number of change you make should always
match<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.510> number<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.840> skipped<00:03:21.260> stitches<00:03:21.950> so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
match the number of skipped stitches so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.660 
match the number of skipped stitches so
obviously<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.630> have<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> huge<00:03:24.140> button<00:03:24.670> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
obviously if you have a huge button that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.650 
obviously if you have a huge button that
you're<00:03:25.850> going<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.330> accommodate

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
you're going to have to accommodate

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.270 
you're going to have to accommodate
you're<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> need<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.650> make<00:03:27.800> this<00:03:27.860> space

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
you're going to need to make this space

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.460 
you're going to need to make this space
wider<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.360> easy<00:03:29.630> just<00:03:29.990> increase

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
wider in it that's easy just increase

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.020 
wider in it that's easy just increase
the<00:03:30.650> number<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:30.950> chains<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.520> make<00:03:31.670> sure<00:03:31.850> it

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
the number of chains and make sure it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.820 
the number of chains and make sure it
matches<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.600> number<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.050> skipped<00:03:33.380> stitches

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
matches the number of skipped stitches

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.510 
matches the number of skipped stitches
okay<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.560> I'm<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.770> chain<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.250> at<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
okay and I'm going to chain one at the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.620 
okay and I'm going to chain one at the
end<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> row<00:03:39.940> now<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.270> going<00:03:41.600> to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
again I'm going through both loops now

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.979 
again I'm going through both loops now
I've<00:03:50.990> come<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.410> my<00:03:51.560> chain<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:53.180> chained<00:03:53.570> to

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
I've come to my chain and I chained to

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.130 
I've come to my chain and I chained to
so<00:03:54.830> I'm<00:03:54.980> going<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.280> work<00:03:55.459> two<00:03:56.120> single<00:03:56.150> crochets
