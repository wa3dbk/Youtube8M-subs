00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
power supply cord which is pretty nice

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
power supply cord which is pretty nice
it's<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.310> too<00:01:41.520> heavy<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.720> too

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it's not too heavy but it's not too

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
it's not too heavy but it's not too
flimsy<00:01:43.110> either<00:01:43.500> I've<00:01:44.430> seen<00:01:44.700> heavier<00:01:45.000> ones<00:01:45.270> but

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
flimsy either I've seen heavier ones but

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
flimsy either I've seen heavier ones but
for<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> 520<00:01:46.290> watt<00:01:46.409> power<00:01:46.619> supply<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.950> seems

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
for a 520 watt power supply this seems

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
for a 520 watt power supply this seems
like<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> trick<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.810> as

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
like it's going to do the trick and as

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
like it's going to do the trick and as
you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> 125<00:01:50.399> volt<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.240> 10<00:01:51.540> amp<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you can see it 125 volt up to 10 amp so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
you can see it 125 volt up to 10 amp so
that's<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> other<00:01:53.220> thing<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> comes<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's that other thing it comes with is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
that's that other thing it comes with is
four<00:01:54.600> screws<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
four screws so this will be for the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.359 
four screws so this will be for the
screwing<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> power<00:01:58.409> supply<00:01:58.649> inside

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
screwing in of the power supply inside

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.469 
screwing in of the power supply inside
your<00:01:59.520> computer<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
pretty good and that's for the rail but

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.800 
pretty good and that's for the rail but
um<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:17.100> looks<00:03:17.130> nice<00:03:17.550> as<00:03:17.820> all<00:03:18.150> these<00:03:18.300> different

and we have the cords as I said they're
all<00:03:31.560> wrapped<00:03:31.740> up<00:03:31.950> I'm<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.490> really

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
kind of connections it comes with by

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.020 
kind of connections it comes with by

you<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.730> 24<00:03:45.180> pin<00:03:45.360> connection<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.590> 28
