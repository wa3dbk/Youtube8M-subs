00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
RAM cards are still pretty expensive and

some ram upgrade kits were closing in on
$1000<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:07.049> lucky

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
$1000 or more but I was actually lucky

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
$1000 or more but I was actually lucky
enough<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:09.650> Patriot<00:01:10.650> memory<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
enough to find Patriot memory which I

have used in the past before and it's
never<00:01:13.680> let<00:01:13.860> me<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.130> yet

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
never let me down yet

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
never let me down yet
specifically<00:01:15.780> Apple<00:01:16.439> ready<00:01:18.380> memory<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
specifically Apple ready memory and this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.789 
specifically Apple ready memory and this
is<00:01:21.380> PC<00:01:22.380> 3

10600 running at 1333 megahertz which is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
10600 running at 1333 megahertz which is
the<00:01:28.650> exact<00:01:29.009> type<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> ram<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.000> need

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the exact type of ram that we would need

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.469 
the exact type of ram that we would need
for<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.479> upgrade<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.479> I've

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
for this upgrade and as you can see I've

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.679 
for this upgrade and as you can see I've
got<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.490> -<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.820> gigabyte<00:01:36.240> modules

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
got two of them - a gigabyte modules

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
got two of them - a gigabyte modules
giving<00:01:37.350> us<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.560> total<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.920> 16<00:01:38.400> gigabytes<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:39.030> RAM

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
giving us a total of 16 gigabytes of RAM

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.440 
giving us a total of 16 gigabytes of RAM
inside<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> Mac<00:01:40.409> Mini<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.150> we're<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> go

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
inside the Mac Mini so we're going to go

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
inside the Mac Mini so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.960> upgrade<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:44.329> right<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
ahead and upgrade this right now and I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
ahead and upgrade this right now and I
figured<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.759> put<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.360> video

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
figured I just put this little video

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.399 
figured I just put this little video
together<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:50.700> people<00:01:50.880> like

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
together because I know some people like

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
together because I know some people like
to<00:01:52.409> watch<00:01:52.560> these<00:01:52.890> kinds<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> upgrade<00:01:53.610> videos

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to watch these kinds of upgrade videos

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.310 
to watch these kinds of upgrade videos
so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.399> am<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.670> than<00:01:56.700> happy<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> oblige<00:01:57.320> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so I am more than happy to oblige so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.569 
so I am more than happy to oblige so
we're<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> start<00:01:58.860> by<00:01:58.979> opening<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
we're going to start by opening up the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
we're going to start by opening up the
bottom<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> Mac<00:02:00.240> Mini<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> simple

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bottom of the Mac Mini which is simple

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.209 
bottom of the Mac Mini which is simple
enough<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:03.060> twist<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
enough you just twist it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
enough you just twist it
counterclockwise<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.509> cover<00:02:06.930> pops

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
counterclockwise and the cover pops

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.820 
counterclockwise and the cover pops
right<00:02:07.680> off<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> inside<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
right off so here is the inside of the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.760 
right off so here is the inside of the
Mac<00:02:10.979> Mini<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
Mac Mini and I can see that there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.280 
Mac Mini and I can see that there
is<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.100> dust<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.820> haven't<00:02:15.090> dusted<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is some dust in here I haven't dusted it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.930 
is some dust in here I haven't dusted it
out<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.560> quite<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> long<00:02:17.070> time<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.820> are

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
out in quite a long time but here are

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.020 
out in quite a long time but here are

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the two four gigabyte RAM modules that I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.540 
the two four gigabyte RAM modules that I
installed<00:02:21.450> about<00:02:21.830> I'd<00:02:22.830> say<00:02:22.860> six<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.490> eight

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

months<00:02:23.760> ago<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.790> again<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:27.240> good<00:02:27.480> Ram<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
months ago and again very good Ram and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.610 
months ago and again very good Ram and
the<00:02:28.290> computer<00:02:28.590> served<00:02:28.830> me<00:02:29.010> very<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.280> but

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the computer served me very well but

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.200 
the computer served me very well but
doing<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.710> RAM<00:02:31.920> upgrade<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.850> use<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
doing this RAM upgrade I do use this

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.140 
doing this RAM upgrade I do use this

the iPhone 5 with such a great built-in
camera<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.960> figured<00:02:43.440> what<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.280> hell<00:02:44.550> I

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
camera so I figured what the hell I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.670 
camera so I figured what the hell I
actually<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.770> these<00:02:46.950> two<00:02:47.250> RAM<00:02:47.610> modules<00:02:47.850> for

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
actually got these two RAM modules for

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.380 
actually got these two RAM modules for

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
to this exact series of RAM again like I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.750 
to this exact series of RAM again like I
said<00:03:01.800> before<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.550> Patriot<00:03:03.030> memory<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
said before it's from Patriot memory and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.410 
said before it's from Patriot memory and
being<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.060> only<00:03:07.220> user<00:03:08.220> serviceable<00:03:08.880> part<00:03:09.270> in

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
being the only user serviceable part in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.510 
being the only user serviceable part in
this<00:03:09.570> machine<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:10.200> course<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.710> is<00:03:10.830> very<00:03:11.130> simple

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
this machine of course it is very simple

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.350 
this machine of course it is very simple
to<00:03:13.040> do<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.190> upgrade<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.060> isn't<00:03:15.270> going

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to do this upgrade so this isn't going

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.180 
to do this upgrade so this isn't going
to<00:03:15.450> take<00:03:15.570> very<00:03:15.810> much<00:03:15.960> time<00:03:16.200> at<00:03:16.380> all<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:20.040> as

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
to take very much time at all so it's as

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.550 
to take very much time at all so it's as
simple<00:03:20.220> as<00:03:20.580> taking<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.300> new<00:03:21.990> RAM<00:03:22.200> out<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
simple as taking the new RAM out of the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.930 
simple as taking the new RAM out of the
package<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.280> taking<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.360> old<00:03:24.540> RAM<00:03:24.959> out<00:03:25.820> as<00:03:26.820> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
package and taking the old RAM out as a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.460 
package and taking the old RAM out as a
matter<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.180> fact<00:03:27.510> why<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:27.900> we<00:03:27.990> just<00:03:28.170> start

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
matter of fact why don't we just start

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:40.390 
matter of fact why don't we just start
out<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.830> give<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.220> quick<00:03:29.430> blowjob

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.180 

alright<00:03:42.320> let's<00:03:43.320> go<00:03:43.440> ahead<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.800> remove<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
alright let's go ahead and remove the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.130 
alright let's go ahead and remove the
old<00:03:44.430> Ram<00:03:44.700> modules<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.450> that's<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:45.750> simple<00:03:45.780> as

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
old Ram modules and that's as simple as

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.650 
old Ram modules and that's as simple as
this<00:03:46.380> just<00:03:47.250> pulling<00:03:47.610> these<00:03:47.730> two<00:03:48.000> tabs<00:03:48.240> apart

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
this just pulling these two tabs apart

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.160 
this just pulling these two tabs apart
the<00:03:48.810> memory<00:03:49.080> module<00:03:49.470> lifts<00:03:49.800> right<00:03:49.950> up<00:03:51.170> you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the memory module lifts right up you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.290 
the memory module lifts right up you
just<00:03:52.380> pull<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> right<00:03:52.800> out<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:53.850> there<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.150> go

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
just pull it right out so there you go

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.580 
just pull it right out so there you go
that's<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.050> original<00:03:57.050> get<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.170> camera<00:03:58.500> to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
that's the original get the camera to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.430 
that's the original get the camera to
focus<00:03:59.990> there<00:04:00.990> we<00:04:01.140> go<00:04:01.580> four<00:04:02.580> gigabyte<00:04:03.440> RAM

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
focus there we go four gigabyte RAM

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.570 
focus there we go four gigabyte RAM
module<00:04:04.920> from<00:04:05.190> Samsung<00:04:07.190> which<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.340> little

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
module from Samsung which is a little

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.290 
module from Samsung which is a little
bit<00:04:08.700> ironic<00:04:09.260> considering<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.500> nature<00:04:10.650> of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
bit ironic considering the nature of

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.090 
bit ironic considering the nature of
Apple<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.420> Samsung<00:04:12.630> as<00:04:13.110> relationship<00:04:13.770> as<00:04:13.950> of

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
Apple and Samsung as relationship as of

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.310 
Apple and Samsung as relationship as of
late<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.959> here's<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.140> second<00:04:16.500> module<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
late and here's the second module and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.039 
late and here's the second module and
here<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.880> or<00:04:20.880> here's<00:04:21.330> at<00:04:21.450> least<00:04:21.600> one<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.960> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049

here are or here's at least one of the
new<00:04:22.169> modules<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.970> as<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.300> see

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.890 

eight<00:04:28.000> gigabytes<00:04:29.280> go<00:04:30.280> ahead<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.550> refocus<00:04:31.060> all

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
eight gigabytes go ahead and refocus all

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.590 
eight gigabytes go ahead and refocus all
right<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.610> course<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:34.030> do<00:04:34.180> start<00:04:34.510> with

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
right so of course we do start with

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.540 
right so of course we do start with
putting<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:37.050> module<00:04:38.050> on<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.980> bottom<00:04:39.370> in

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
putting the module on the bottom in

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.890 
putting the module on the bottom in
first<00:04:40.650> snaps<00:04:41.650> right<00:04:41.920> in<00:04:42.450> taking<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.540> second

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
first snaps right in taking the second

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.760 
first snaps right in taking the second
module<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.940> again<00:04:45.940> making<00:04:46.300> sure<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.840> get<00:04:47.620> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
module here again making sure to get the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.370 
module here again making sure to get the
notches<00:04:47.980> lined<00:04:48.520> up<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.000> also<00:04:49.810> make<00:04:49.990> sure<00:04:50.020> not

right<00:05:03.370> there<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:04.980> just<00:05:05.980> gently<00:05:06.400> push<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:06.880> down

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
right there and just gently push it down

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.300 
right there and just gently push it down
and<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:08.140> all<00:05:08.290> sits<00:05:08.560> together<00:05:08.740> like<00:05:09.040> that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
and it all sits together like that

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.590 
and it all sits together like that
so<00:05:09.640> now<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.790> we<00:05:09.940> have<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.150> RAM<00:05:10.300> installed

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
so now that we have the RAM installed

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.880 
so now that we have the RAM installed
we're<00:05:10.810> going<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:10.990> go<00:05:11.080> ahead<00:05:11.200> pop<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.710> cover

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
we're going to go ahead pop the cover

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.870 
we're going to go ahead pop the cover
back<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:15.060> which<00:05:16.060> should<00:05:16.840> not<00:05:17.050> be<00:05:17.640> too<00:05:18.640> much<00:05:18.820> of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
back on which should not be too much of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.390 
back on which should not be too much of
an<00:05:19.090> issue<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.510> I<00:05:19.630> can<00:05:19.810> line<00:05:20.050> up<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:21.190> holes

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
an issue if I can line up the holes

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.890 
an issue if I can line up the holes
properly<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:22.210> then<00:05:22.780> turning<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.470> clockwise

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
properly and then turning it clockwise

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.840 
properly and then turning it clockwise
all<00:05:25.900> locks<00:05:26.650> back<00:05:26.830> together<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.310> that

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.770 

alright<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.410> now<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.440> we<00:05:32.680> have<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:33.780> 16

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
alright so now that we have the 16

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.330 
alright so now that we have the 16
gigabytes<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.320> RAM<00:05:35.530> installed<00:05:35.980> now<00:05:36.190> we're
