hello welcome to gamescom 2013 where we
just<00:00:07.140> played<00:00:07.379> titanfall<00:00:08.069> Andy<00:00:08.880> first

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
just played titanfall Andy first

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.810 
just played titanfall Andy first
reaction<00:00:10.170> oh<00:00:10.349> my<00:00:10.620> god<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:10.980> exciting<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.639> was

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
reaction oh my god so exciting it was

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.120 
reaction oh my god so exciting it was
pretty<00:00:12.480> much<00:00:12.630> non-stop<00:00:12.960> action<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
pretty much non-stop action the the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
pretty much non-stop action the the
level<00:00:14.400> was<00:00:14.519> quite<00:00:14.730> small<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.299> you're<00:00:16.080> all

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
level was quite small so you're all

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.230 
level was quite small so you're all
crammed<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.560> together<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.250> dudes<00:00:17.580> giant

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
crammed in together it's dudes giant

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330 
crammed in together it's dudes giant
robots<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.350> point<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.279> were

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
robots at one point I think there were

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.800 
robots at one point I think there were
so<00:00:20.490> many<00:00:20.640> giant<00:00:21.029> robots<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> street<00:00:21.779> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so many giant robots in the street that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.790 
so many giant robots in the street that
you<00:00:21.930> couldn't<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.260> move<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you couldn't really move it was like a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
you couldn't really move it was like a
traffic<00:00:23.189> jam<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.430> giant<00:00:23.910> robots<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> everyone

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
traffic jam of giant robots and everyone

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.359 
traffic jam of giant robots and everyone
was<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.410> sort<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> running<00:00:25.830> around<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.160> fire

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
was just sort of running around on fire

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.179 
was just sort of running around on fire
and<00:00:26.519> exploding<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:28.410> most<00:00:28.590> exciting

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and exploding it was the most exciting

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.380 
and exploding it was the most exciting
thing<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.400> played<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.760> ages<00:00:30.060> i<00:00:30.210> think

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
thing I played for ages i think

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.470 
thing I played for ages i think
incredibly<00:00:30.990> hectic<00:00:31.170> frantic<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.070> dense<00:00:33.059> like

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
incredibly hectic frantic and dense like

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.740 
incredibly hectic frantic and dense like
really<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.559> close<00:00:34.829> quarters<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.540> i<00:00:36.540> was

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
really really close quarters and i was

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
really really close quarters and i was
surprised<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:38.300> tremendously<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
surprised by how tremendously well the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.479 
surprised by how tremendously well the
double<00:00:40.440> jumping<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.890> wall<00:00:41.040> running<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
double jumping and wall running is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
double jumping and wall running is
because<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> pilot<00:00:42.629> you're<00:00:43.020> extremely

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
because as a pilot you're extremely

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
because as a pilot you're extremely
agile<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.399> yeah<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.180> you've<00:00:45.750> got<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
agile right yeah so you've got the the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
agile right yeah so you've got the the
double<00:00:46.590> jump<00:00:46.770> ability<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.730> jump<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
double jump ability so you can jump and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
double jump ability so you can jump and
then<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.329> jump<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> apex<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> your

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
then you can jump at the apex of your

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020 
then you can jump at the apex of your
jump<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> feels<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.370> Mirror's<00:00:50.700> Edge<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
jump kind of feels like Mirror's Edge in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
jump kind of feels like Mirror's Edge in
the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.660> you'll<00:00:52.170> sprinter

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the way that you will you'll sprinter

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
the way that you will you'll sprinter
the<00:00:52.710> wall<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.129> angle<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.699> double<00:00:54.090> jump<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the wall at an angle a double jump and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.400 
the wall at an angle a double jump and
then<00:00:54.510> you'll<00:00:54.600> hit<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> wall<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> angle

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
then you'll hit the wall of that angle

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.660 
then you'll hit the wall of that angle
and<00:00:55.440> you'll<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.770> running<00:00:56.100> along<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> wall

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and you'll start running along the wall

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
and you'll start running along the wall
mirrors<00:00:57.329> edge<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.989> can

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
mirrors edge start and then you can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
mirrors edge start and then you can
double<00:00:58.350> jump<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.770> again<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
double jump from that again so you can

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
double jump from that again so you can
basically<00:01:00.600> scale<00:01:01.079> buildings<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.949> couple<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
basically scale buildings in a couple of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
basically scale buildings in a couple of
moves<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> way

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
moves I think that's the kind of the way

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
moves I think that's the kind of the way
that<00:01:04.049> they've<00:01:04.379> tried<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> balance<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> pilots

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that they've tried to balance the pilots

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
that they've tried to balance the pilots
against<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> Titans<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.890> pilot

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
against the the Titans because a pilot

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
against the the Titans because a pilot
can<00:01:08.790> quite<00:01:09.119> easily<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.630> down<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.900> Titan<00:01:10.320> if

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
can quite easily take down a Titan if

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.190 
can quite easily take down a Titan if
they<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:10.830> behind<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.990> actually<00:01:12.990> jump

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
they get around behind it actually jump

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.480 
they get around behind it actually jump
up<00:01:13.350> onto<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> head<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.430> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
up onto the head of the time they can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
up onto the head of the time they can
pull<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> casing<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.900> they

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
pull the kind of a casing off it they

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
pull the kind of a casing off it they
can<00:01:16.140> start<00:01:16.320> firing<00:01:16.619> guns<00:01:16.950> into<00:01:17.250> its<00:01:17.369> gears

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
can start firing guns into its gears

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.609 
can start firing guns into its gears
from<00:01:18.210> there<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.530> do

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
from there and I don't think I can do

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.960 
from there and I don't think I can do
anything<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> point<00:01:20.790> now

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
anything about that that's the point now

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.130 
anything about that that's the point now
I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> reduced<00:01:21.750> sort<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I think it's the reduced sort of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.660 
I think it's the reduced sort of
situational<00:01:22.680> awareness<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.340> you're<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
situational awareness when you're in a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
situational awareness when you're in a
giant<00:01:24.060> robot<00:01:24.180> suit<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
giant robot suit when you're you know a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
giant robot suit when you're you know a
little<00:01:26.280> pilot<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.090> vulnerable<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
little pilot you're more vulnerable but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
little pilot you're more vulnerable but
you're<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> lot<00:01:28.560> faster<00:01:29.070> d<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.430> every<00:01:29.640> pilot<00:01:29.909> has

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you're a lot faster d so every pilot has

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
you're a lot faster d so every pilot has
access<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.659> an<00:01:30.840> anti<00:01:31.170> Titan<00:01:31.560> weapon<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
access to like an anti Titan weapon so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980 
access to like an anti Titan weapon so

that's all you're going to want to do
there<00:01:44.460> were<00:01:44.549> points<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> had<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> tight

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
there were points when I had a tight

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
there were points when I had a tight
ready<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.810> wasn't<00:01:46.140> calling<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
ready I wasn't calling it in because I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.960 
ready I wasn't calling it in because I
was<00:01:46.860> getting<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.189> more<00:01:47.220> kills<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> pilot

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
was getting a lot more kills as a pilot

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
was getting a lot more kills as a pilot
so<00:01:48.420> well<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.170> pick<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> class<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> pilot<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so well you pick a class as a pilot and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
so well you pick a class as a pilot and
you<00:01:50.610> pick<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:50.970> class<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> Titan<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.259> there

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you pick your class as a Titan so there

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
you pick your class as a Titan so there
are<00:01:52.470> different<00:01:52.740> variants<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> each<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.180> when

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
are different variants of each but when

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120 
are different variants of each but when
you've<00:01:54.420> called<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:55.020> Titan<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.950> can

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you've called in your Titan as you can

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
you've called in your Titan as you can
every<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.490> often<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.270> also<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> AI

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
every so often you can also set it to AI

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
every so often you can also set it to AI
which<00:01:58.409> turns<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> God<00:01:59.930> for

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
which turns it into a kind of God for

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.850 
which turns it into a kind of God for
you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.859 
you
come<00:02:02.220> on

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
and I was just running through packs of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.950 
and I was just running through packs of
people<00:02:55.250> like<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.550> i<00:02:55.760> mean<00:02:55.910> could<00:02:56.660> be<00:02:56.810> that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
people like this i mean could be that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.300 
people like this i mean could be that
they<00:02:57.080> were<00:02:57.140> because<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.680> were<00:02:57.920> playing<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> mix

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
they were because we were playing a mix

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.000 
they were because we were playing a mix
of<00:02:58.520> human<00:02:59.150> players<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.810> BOTS<00:02:59.990> obviously<00:03:00.920> get

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
of human players and BOTS obviously get

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.200 
of human players and BOTS obviously get
more<00:03:01.160> points<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.490> killing<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.790> human<00:03:01.910> player

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
more points for killing a human player

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.550 
more points for killing a human player
but<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.930> could<00:03:03.080> have<00:03:03.170> been<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.350> was<00:03:03.440> just

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
but it could have been I was just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.630 
but it could have been I was just

running through bots like that and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.040 
running through bots like that and
thinking<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.090> amazing<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.690> did<00:03:05.840> seem

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
off a level as well it's just a way of

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.770 
off a level as well it's just a way of
getting<00:03:43.310> extra<00:03:43.700> XP<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.210> way<00:03:44.330> of<00:03:44.510> kind<00:03:44.660> of

giving<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.830> losing<00:03:46.130> team<00:03:46.280> maybe<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.610> chance<00:03:46.820> of

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
giving the losing team maybe a chance of

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:56.650 
giving the losing team maybe a chance of

like similarities and differences I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.340 
like similarities and differences I
thought<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.950> felt<00:04:07.100> really<00:04:07.280> fast<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.120> really

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
modern warfare does but in other ways

modern warfare does but in other ways
extremely<00:04:14.630> dissimilar<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.860> you're

it really felt distinctive which was so

the<00:04:26.990> environments<00:04:27.530> because<00:04:27.650> what<00:04:28.010> we've<00:04:28.130> seen

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the environments because what we've seen

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.040 
the environments because what we've seen
so<00:04:28.310> far<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.820> trailers<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:29.840> demo

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
so far in trailers and in this demo

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.860 
so far in trailers and in this demo
today<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:31.070> certain<00:04:31.550> sort<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.120> slightly

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
today is a certain sort of slightly

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.650 
today is a certain sort of slightly
wrecked<00:04:33.230> urban<00:04:33.830> looking<00:04:34.400> sci-fi<00:04:34.970> setting<00:04:35.450> and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
wrecked urban looking sci-fi setting and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.390 
wrecked urban looking sci-fi setting and
I<00:04:36.560> know<00:04:36.680> they're<00:04:36.950> going<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> have

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
I know they're going to have to have

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.610 
I know they're going to have to have
certain<00:04:37.960> environments<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.110> allow<00:04:39.350> for<00:04:39.590> that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
certain environments to allow for that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.590 
certain environments to allow for that
wall<00:04:39.860> running<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.310> jumping<00:04:40.460> between<00:04:40.760> narrow

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
wall running and jumping between narrow

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.090 
wall running and jumping between narrow
streets<00:04:43.000> right<00:04:44.000> exactly<00:04:44.690> but<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.140> think<00:04:45.800> it's

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
streets right exactly but I think it's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.620 
streets right exactly but I think it's
really<00:04:46.430> going<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.670> need<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.850> be<00:04:47.000> sustained<00:04:47.390> by

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
really going to need to be sustained by

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.540 
really going to need to be sustained by
some<00:04:47.930> kind<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.170> visual<00:04:48.440> variety<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:48.920> well<00:04:49.100> to
