00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello how are we going to explain how to install a system of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.710
 ink from a roof printer 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.830
 p 7 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 a 6 5 and 6 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.380
 we will be more loaded 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.619
 vitacura 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.339
 from what they export 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.150
 chip etc as 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.050
 with the vote I do not know what I do your boxes syringes 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.130
 your titles 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.939
 and its supports for meshes 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.939
 the bull that contains its part 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.220
 let's put possession of the charge for example cartridge 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.800
 building 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.830
 the charge we are going to disconnect the cable from the light 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.550
 so that they were not cut 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 and so we can work 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 to place them cartridge is very important 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.380
 when this moment 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.540
 let's make strength 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.330
 and among all the cartridges 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.170
 Must do 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.610
 all cartridges 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.490
 we participate track 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 well seen writes them 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.920
 we place our supports the middle part 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530
 from this position 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 for when a hose ran, it did not get stuck 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.980
 Manolete 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.500
 let's run expensive 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 to strike the husband of the mother of God 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510
 the flag was not there although we do not have 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.560
 the problem 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 hence the biggest year 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 with the payment of treasure bonds 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 the fight 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.200
 It is very important that the system has very high level of the printer 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.010
 that is not higher or lower but higher 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.340
 will spill all bull ink investors a good year reaches 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.859
 20 years that remove these little plugs from the system 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.629
 and there we are going to place 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.839
 200 demands 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 this is so that the ink did not dry out highly 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.219
 to reign added a system 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.909
 we're just going to remove these big plugs and for the same thing we talk 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.599
 by the government that in what is going away if the whole system of selectivity 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.629
 there 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 the head and that can spoil it 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.519
 we wait for him 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.659
 pt to palliate a little green 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 to recognize the data 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.809
 Falklands support 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.809
 we can not place here 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.719
 to be able to close a little more our 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.220
 I recommend that the basics of the scanner because if not the hose 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.419
 can drown is not coincidence 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.699
 to scan we can work so it's no problem the documents do not 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.709
 does it move 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 and can sell without any problem 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.069
 for rctv show 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.699
 the machine does not criticize in the middle part 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.109
 what color do you need to change 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.079
 we are not going to take out the cartridges simply when they are in position 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.299
 to remove the we are going to press the chip button 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.569
 for three seconds we release it and we press the boot button again 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 how each cartridge prevents them 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.719
 when we see how little about the risk of blinking we know that our 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.319
 system is seen parts to the pri 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.249
 that's all gas
