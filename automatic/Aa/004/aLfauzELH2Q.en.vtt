00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
okay so now

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.620 
okay so now
well<00:03:13.960> I'm<00:03:14.290> gonna<00:03:14.940> change<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.090> curves<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:16.480> that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
well I'm gonna change the curves on that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.300 
well I'm gonna change the curves on that
a<00:03:16.660> bit<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> bit<00:03:18.100> closer<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:20.310> green

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
a bit make it a bit closer to the green

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:34.420 
a bit make it a bit closer to the green
that<00:03:21.490> I<00:03:21.550> want<00:03:22.020> or<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.290> brightness<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.430> want

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.170 

and<00:03:34.849> again<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.239> quickly<00:03:35.569> brush<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.049> on

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and again just quickly brush that on

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.690 
and again just quickly brush that on
there<00:03:38.719> we<00:03:38.840> go

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.090 

also<00:03:43.480> let's<00:03:43.840> look<00:03:44.050> at<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.350> saturation<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
also let's look at the saturation and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.420 
also let's look at the saturation and
see<00:03:45.340> if

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
see if

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.940 
see if
it's<00:03:46.909> good

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
it's good

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.520 
it's good
push<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.640> up<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.819> little<00:03:49.970> bit

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.280 

okay<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:56.520> let's<00:03:59.180> fade<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.510> white<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.080> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
okay now let's fade it to white on the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.500 
okay now let's fade it to white on the
top<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.620> bottom<00:04:01.710> like<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> site<00:04:02.430> take<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
top and bottom like on the site take the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.530 
top and bottom like on the site take the
color<00:04:03.720> tool<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.250> white<00:04:05.610> already<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.240> I'll

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
color tool this on white already so I'll

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.600 
color tool this on white already so I'll
just<00:04:06.780> apply<00:04:06.960> that<00:04:07.140> with<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> mask<00:04:07.620> take<00:04:08.430> my

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
just apply that with the mask take my

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.379 
just apply that with the mask take my
gradient<00:04:09.060> here<00:04:10.610> do<00:04:11.610> once<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.000> top

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:26.950 

there<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.109> go<00:04:17.259> and<00:04:17.819> once<00:04:18.819> on<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.299> bottom

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.730 

now<00:04:27.470> all<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:28.009> is<00:04:28.130> add<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.400> text

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
now all I have to do is add the text

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:39.420 
now all I have to do is add the text
we'll<00:04:30.740> take<00:04:30.889> my<00:04:31.040> text<00:04:31.250> tool

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.360 

Center<00:04:40.210> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
Center it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.750 

typing

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.459 

okay<00:05:17.199> and<00:05:17.499> we're<00:05:17.710> going<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:17.949> put<00:05:18.219> it<00:05:18.369> there

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
okay and we're going to put it there

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.429 
okay and we're going to put it there
and<00:05:20.639> apply<00:05:21.639> with<00:05:21.699> masks<00:05:22.119> so<00:05:22.929> we<00:05:23.050> can<00:05:23.169> take<00:05:23.319> our

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:23.439 
and apply with masks so we can take our

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.969 
and apply with masks so we can take our
gradient<00:05:23.909> we<00:05:24.909> can<00:05:25.089> make<00:05:25.209> it<00:05:25.360> fade<00:05:26.229> in<00:05:26.439> as<00:05:26.800> it

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
gradient we can make it fade in as it

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:35.030 
gradient we can make it fade in as it
does<00:05:27.099> on<00:05:27.159> the<00:05:27.279> site

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.620 

there<00:05:35.670> we<00:05:35.910> go<00:05:36.480> add<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.170> gradient

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.680 

and<00:05:39.720> we<00:05:40.410> are<00:05:40.530> going<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:42.980> erase<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:45.150> text

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
and we are going to that erase the text

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.350 
and we are going to that erase the text
from<00:05:46.050> here<00:05:48.260> so<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.790> looks<00:05:50.790> like<00:05:50.970> it's

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
from here so that it looks like it's

00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:00.560 
from here so that it looks like it's
peeking<00:05:51.900> out<00:05:52.020> from<00:05:52.580> behind<00:05:53.580> yeah

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:08.050 

behind<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.470> filter

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.519 

what<00:06:09.060> slightly<00:06:09.690> more<00:06:09.870> restaurants<00:06:10.500> I

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.740 

it<00:06:15.129> looks<00:06:15.279> pretty<00:06:15.519> good

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.420 

keep<00:06:18.350> pushing<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:18.890> off

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.999 

and<00:06:23.910> there<00:06:24.060> we<00:06:24.120> have<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.300> if<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:25.139> want<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.500> size

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
and there we have it if I want to size

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.540 
and there we have it if I want to size
it<00:06:26.190> exactly<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.699> believe<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.210> is<00:06:27.270> 984<00:06:28.550> pixels

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
it exactly I believe it is 984 pixels

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.420 
it exactly I believe it is 984 pixels
wide<00:06:30.139> and<00:06:31.139> just<00:06:31.259> scale<00:06:31.650> it<00:06:31.680> down<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:34.430> that's

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
wide and just scale it down and that's

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.249 
wide and just scale it down and that's
it

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
it

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.440 
it
thanks<00:06:37.259> for<00:06:37.380> watching
