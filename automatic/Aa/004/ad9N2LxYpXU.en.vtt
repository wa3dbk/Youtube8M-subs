going to be talking a little bit about

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.880 
going to be talking a little bit about
fire<00:00:42.579> starters<00:00:43.180> actually<00:00:43.899> one<00:00:44.170> fire<00:00:44.410> starter

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
fire starters actually one fire starter

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.189 
fire starters actually one fire starter
in<00:00:45.040> particular<00:00:45.430> now<00:00:46.239> I<00:00:46.300> know<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.750> there<00:00:46.960> is<00:00:47.170> a

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
in particular now I know that there is a

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.400 
in particular now I know that there is a
vast<00:00:47.800> variety<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.820> fire<00:00:49.390> starters<00:00:49.900> out<00:00:50.140> there

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
vast variety of fire starters out there

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.900 
vast variety of fire starters out there
and<00:00:50.650> you<00:00:50.829> guys<00:00:50.949> have<00:00:51.100> probably<00:00:51.220> seen<00:00:51.730> the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
and you guys have probably seen the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.819 
and you guys have probably seen the
majority<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.360> them<00:00:52.659> however<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.589> one<00:00:53.710> that

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
majority of them however the one that

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.689 
majority of them however the one that
I'm<00:00:53.890> going<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.070> share<00:00:54.220> with<00:00:54.400> you<00:00:54.519> guys<00:00:54.550> today

I'm going to share with you guys today
is<00:00:55.030> actually<00:00:55.390> really<00:00:56.079> unique<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.710> really

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
is actually really unique and really

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.770 
is actually really unique and really
really<00:00:57.640> cool<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.000> think<00:00:58.180> you're<00:00:58.420> going<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.629> like

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
really cool I think you're going to like

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.350 
really cool I think you're going to like
it<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:58.989> lot<00:00:59.230> what<00:01:00.040> it<00:01:00.159> is<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.579> this<00:01:01.059> little

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
it a lot what it is is this little

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.450 
it a lot what it is is this little
fellow<00:01:01.540> right<00:01:01.809> here<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.469> what<00:01:03.070> makes<00:01:03.280> this

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
fellow right here and what makes this

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.609 
fellow right here and what makes this
different<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.119> unique<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.410> actually

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
different and unique is that it actually

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.820 
different and unique is that it actually
combines<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.420> two<00:01:07.660> separate<00:01:08.110> components<00:01:08.410> of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
combines the two separate components of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.520 
combines the two separate components of
an<00:01:08.890> emergency<00:01:09.310> fire-starting<00:01:10.000> device<00:01:10.530> one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
an emergency fire-starting device one

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.430 
an emergency fire-starting device one
which<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.630> ignition<00:01:13.630> source<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.200> one

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
which is the ignition source and one

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680 
which is the ignition source and one
which<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.070> accelerant<00:01:15.910> something<00:01:16.509> that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
which is the accelerant something that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.719 
which is the accelerant something that
will<00:01:16.899> provide<00:01:17.560> enough<00:01:17.979> flame<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.520> enough

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
will provide enough flame and enough

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.880 
will provide enough flame and enough
heat<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.300> keep<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.600> fire<00:01:19.810> going<00:01:19.860> long<00:01:20.860> enough

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
heat to keep your fire going long enough

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.580 
heat to keep your fire going long enough
to<00:01:21.550> get<00:01:21.729> your<00:01:22.300> fuel<00:01:22.660> started<00:01:23.140> whether<00:01:23.289> that's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
to get your fuel started whether that's

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.109 
to get your fuel started whether that's
wet<00:01:23.890> wood<00:01:24.100> or<00:01:24.399> whatever<00:01:24.580> else<00:01:24.880> you're<00:01:25.090> using

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
wet wood or whatever else you're using

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.850 
wet wood or whatever else you're using
in<00:01:25.630> adverse<00:01:26.140> conditions

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
in adverse conditions

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.710 
in adverse conditions
now<00:01:27.429> typically<00:01:27.940> when<00:01:28.179> you're<00:01:28.300> dealing<00:01:28.450> with<00:01:28.600> a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
now typically when you're dealing with a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.450 
now typically when you're dealing with a
fire<00:01:28.960> starter<00:01:29.440> you're<00:01:29.860> dealing<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:30.220> two

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
fire starter you're dealing with two

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.910 
fire starter you're dealing with two
separate<00:01:30.789> components<00:01:31.450> one<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.649> ignition

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
separate components one is the ignition

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.469 
separate components one is the ignition
source<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.429> course<00:01:33.670> such<00:01:34.000> as<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> good<00:01:34.329> old

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
source of course such as a good old

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.780 
source of course such as a good old
lighter<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.380> other<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.799> some<00:01:36.549> source

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
lighter and the other is a some source

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.330 
lighter and the other is a some source
of<00:01:37.000> accelerant<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:38.049> Vaseline<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.890> cotton

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
of accelerant like a Vaseline so cotton

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.429 
of accelerant like a Vaseline so cotton
ball<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.790> as<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.299> mentioned<00:01:40.810> what<00:01:41.049> this<00:01:41.229> fire

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
ball and as I mentioned what this fire

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.890 
ball and as I mentioned what this fire
starter<00:01:41.890> does<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.369> combines<00:01:43.119> those<00:01:43.390> two<00:01:43.450> in

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
starter does is combines those two in

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.679 
starter does is combines those two in
