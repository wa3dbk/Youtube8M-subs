with this the corners of the case do

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.789 
with this the corners of the case do
come<00:02:22.849> up<00:02:22.879> above<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.480> glass<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.500> will<00:02:24.709> get

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
come up above the glass so you will get

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
glass ones there's no doubt about that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.430

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
top you just have the one cut out for

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.199 
top you just have the one cut out for
the<00:02:57.500> sleep<00:02:57.739> awake<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.160> love<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.519> all<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the sleep awake I love how all the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.880 
the sleep awake I love how all the
cutouts<00:02:59.540> kind<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.870> match<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.410> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.739> that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
cutouts kind of match you can see that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.380 
cutouts kind of match you can see that
angle<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.459> they<00:03:01.849> all<00:03:02.000> kind<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.299> look

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
angle that they all kind of look

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.119 
angle that they all kind of look
identical<00:03:02.660> even<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.440> for<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.739> Lightning

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
identical even the one for the Lightning

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.520 
identical even the one for the Lightning
port<00:03:04.370> there<00:03:04.640> looks<00:03:05.420> very<00:03:05.690> similar<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.379> one

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
port there looks very similar to the one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.559 
port there looks very similar to the one
for<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:06.890> sleep<00:03:07.340> awake<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.819> way<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> angle<00:03:08.420> is

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
for the sleep awake the way the angle is
