I<00:00:08.809> in<00:00:09.809> theory<00:00:10.260> looking<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.740> draft<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.190> me

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
I in theory looking at this draft for me

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.530 
I in theory looking at this draft for me
I<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.430> cloud<00:00:11.760> nine<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> win<00:00:12.270> the<00:00:12.389> game

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
I think cloud nine can win the game

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.430 
I think cloud nine can win the game
without<00:00:12.629> landing<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.139> RP<00:00:13.440> okay<00:00:15.110> then<00:00:16.110> I<00:00:16.230> don't

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
without landing an RP okay then I don't

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
without landing an RP okay then I don't
think<00:00:16.710> there<00:00:16.859> anything<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.220> getting<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
think there anything on getting the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.980 
think there anything on getting the
graph<00:00:17.789> later<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.180> he<00:00:18.210> will<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.630> speaking<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
graph later as he will be speaking of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
graph later as he will be speaking of
graph<00:00:19.199> getting<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> rune<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.039> gonna<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.340> a
