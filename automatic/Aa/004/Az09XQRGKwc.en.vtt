00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
 today I'm going to show you how to do your 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.049
 own question house 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.549
 in this case I'm going to do rowing 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.430
 but do not worry about you too 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.280
 they can ask the question they want 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 having a poly as a base 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.660
 the materials they will need are these 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 sugar 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700
 marmalade 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.700
 and a dessert plate 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.030
 yes with not so big 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.300
 the first thing they will do is this a 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.360
 teaspoon of sugar on one side of the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.360
 dish leaving a free space 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.070
 it's a sugar jam and they start it 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.370
 to mix 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:07.479
 without going to the other side 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.479
 try to mix it well 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
 there has to be something like that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.920
 then after being well mixed you put 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.400
 the cop that you're going to transform into 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.980
 qwest ehlers 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.560
 to the other past 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.680
 in this case I'm going to get in, I'm going to 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.680
 put 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.540
 now we put it to the fish do not forget that 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.870
 If you do not have that mixture, you will not be able to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 do not a star and now we wait 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.800
 20 minutes 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.770
 hi are the one o'clock we have to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 wait until one and twenty or one minute 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.079
 more not a minute less we have to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.020
 take it out at the exact time one and twenty are 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:04.020
 the 120 hours to remove it by opening 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 opening 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.720
 you already have your own home question 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.579
 you already have your own house 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.579
 it was a lie
