think about you know really extreme

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.120 
think about you know really extreme
designs<00:00:29.600> for<00:00:29.750> science<00:00:30.109> I'd<00:00:30.260> like<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.770> get<00:00:30.949> them

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
designs for science I'd like to get them

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.250 
designs for science I'd like to get them
excited<00:00:31.490> yeah<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:31.939> know<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:32.359> at<00:00:32.719> first<00:00:33.020> sight

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
excited yeah you know so at first sight

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.630 
excited yeah you know so at first sight
when<00:00:33.500> they<00:00:33.680> see<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.949> car<00:00:34.100> they<00:00:34.219> feel<00:00:34.399> well

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
when they see the car they feel well

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.349 
when they see the car they feel well
what<00:00:34.879> is<00:00:35.030> this

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.359 
what is this

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.779 
what is this
so<00:00:35.870> that's<00:00:36.260> basically<00:00:36.350> why<00:00:36.679> we<00:00:36.829> want<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.129> so

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
so that's basically why we want it so

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.639 
so that's basically why we want it so
we're<00:00:38.539> keeping<00:00:38.659> the<00:00:38.870> car<00:00:39.019> in<00:00:39.109> a<00:00:39.170> very<00:00:39.319> small

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
we're keeping the car in a very small

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.439 
we're keeping the car in a very small
compact<00:00:40.100> size<00:00:40.370> we<00:00:40.699> wanted<00:00:40.909> to<00:00:40.999> have<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.179> maximum

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
compact size we wanted to have a maximum

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.020 
compact size we wanted to have a maximum
look<00:00:41.839> and<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.679> know<00:00:42.769> maximum<00:00:43.129> impact<00:00:43.519> so

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
look and you know maximum impact so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.430 
look and you know maximum impact so
basically<00:00:44.629> we've<00:00:44.809> been<00:00:44.870> working<00:00:45.319> on<00:00:45.409> very

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
basically we've been working on very

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.799 
basically we've been working on very
extreme<00:00:46.309> features<00:00:46.670> like<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:46.969> window<00:00:47.690> you

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
extreme features like this window you

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.119 
extreme features like this window you
can<00:00:47.870> see<00:00:48.109> here<00:00:48.289> that<00:00:48.409> gave<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.769> really<00:00:49.100> a

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
can see here that gave it really a

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.430 
can see here that gave it really a
unique<00:00:49.549> character<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.210> yeah<00:00:50.809> we<00:00:50.960> talked<00:00:51.350> about

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
unique character so yeah we talked about

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.979 
unique character so yeah we talked about
size<00:00:51.769> because<00:00:52.579> you've<00:00:53.359> taken<00:00:53.510> some<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.929> the

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
size because you've taken some of the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.539 
size because you've taken some of the
cues<00:00:54.289> some<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.709> box<00:00:54.949> units<00:00:55.249> that<00:00:55.399> we

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
cues some of the box units that we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.939 
cues some of the box units that we
recognized<00:00:56.389> from<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.629> xB<00:00:57.079> but<00:00:57.589> you've<00:00:57.769> moved

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
recognized from the xB but you've moved

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.709 
recognized from the xB but you've moved
it<00:00:58.159> into<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.399> even<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.819> much<00:00:59.059> smaller<00:00:59.420> package

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
it into a even a much smaller package

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.030 
it into a even a much smaller package
yeah<00:01:00.579> why<00:01:01.579> why<00:01:01.969> smaller<00:01:02.420> why<00:01:03.350> smaller<00:01:03.709> because

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
yeah why why smaller why smaller because

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.680 
yeah why why smaller why smaller because
first<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.460> wanted<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.790> have<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> really<00:01:05.479> you

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
first we wanted to have a really you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.590 
first we wanted to have a really you
know<00:01:05.720> compact<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.590> very<00:01:07.280> tough<00:01:07.730> look<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.450> we

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
know compact and very tough look and we

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.890 
know compact and very tough look and we
could<00:01:08.750> have<00:01:08.900> achieved<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> very

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
could have achieved this on this a very

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.070 
could have achieved this on this a very
classy

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
classy

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.310 
classy
it's<00:01:12.470> very<00:01:12.650> compact<00:01:13.040> size<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:13.970> we<00:01:14.930> achieve

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
it's very compact size and we achieve

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.810 
it's very compact size and we achieve
this<00:01:15.440> with<00:01:15.620> big<00:01:15.860> fenders<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:16.580> we<00:01:16.670> could

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
this with big fenders so we could

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.110 
this with big fenders so we could
enhance<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.390> car<00:01:17.570> as<00:01:17.750> much<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.080> we<00:01:18.170> could<00:01:18.320> and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
enhance this car as much as we could and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.430 
enhance this car as much as we could and
so<00:01:20.120> basically<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.630> wanted<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.930> keep<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.200> box

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
so basically we wanted to keep the box

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.780 
so basically we wanted to keep the box
as<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.430> symbol<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.880> Scion<00:01:23.240> but<00:01:24.550> we<00:01:25.550> try<00:01:25.760> to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
as a symbol of Scion but we try to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.610 
as a symbol of Scion but we try to
sculpt<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.510> make<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:26.930> give<00:01:27.290> it<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.470> lot<00:01:27.590> of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
sculpt it and make it give it a lot of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.620 
sculpt it and make it give it a lot of
volume<00:01:27.980> and<00:01:28.340> lots<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.610> emotion<00:01:29.120> in<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:29.510> you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
volume and lots of emotion in it so you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510 
volume and lots of emotion in it so you
can<00:01:29.660> see<00:01:29.960> basically<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.380> big<00:01:30.590> big<00:01:31.040> fenders

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
can see basically this big big fenders

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.380 
can see basically this big big fenders
here<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:33.280> big<00:01:34.280> fenders<00:01:34.670> here<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:34.970> enhance

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
here and big fenders here that enhance

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.790 
here and big fenders here that enhance
the<00:01:35.480> stance<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.930> car<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:36.440> very<00:01:36.530> data

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
the stance of the car so it's very data

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.740 
the stance of the car so it's very data
line<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.370> know<00:01:37.490> very<00:01:37.730> surface

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
line and you know very surface

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.650 
line and you know very surface
and<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:39.440> kept<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.800> box<00:01:40.580> with<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.120> cabin<00:01:41.420> image

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
and we kept the box with the cabin image

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.570 
and we kept the box with the cabin image
yeah<00:01:42.080> as<00:01:42.410> you<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.650> see<00:01:42.830> there's<00:01:43.010> not<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.220> single

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
yeah as you can see there's not a single

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.130 
yeah as you can see there's not a single
straight<00:01:43.820> line<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.300> we'd<00:01:44.450> get<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> image<00:01:44.990> of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
straight line so we'd get the image of

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.740 
straight line so we'd get the image of
the<00:01:45.290> box<00:01:45.500> without<00:01:45.680> cutting<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.820> right<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.480> I

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
the box without cutting it right as I

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.630 
the box without cutting it right as I
was<00:01:47.870> noticing<00:01:48.110> about<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> roof<00:01:48.620> line<00:01:48.860> some<00:01:49.550> of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
was noticing about the roof line some of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.160 
was noticing about the roof line some of
one<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.000> features<00:01:50.300> we've<00:01:50.450> seen<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.990> modern

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
one of the features we've seen in modern

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.910 
one of the features we've seen in modern
design<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.220> black<00:01:53.030> down<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.750> pillar<00:01:54.440> but

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
design is the black down a pillar but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.550 
design is the black down a pillar but
you<00:01:55.040> want<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.280> exact<00:01:55.700> opposite<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.720> you've

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
you want the exact opposite and you've

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
you want the exact opposite and you've
you've<00:01:58.160> moved<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.150> blacked<00:01:59.510> out<00:01:59.690> pillar<00:01:59.960> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
you've moved that blacked out pillar to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
you've moved that blacked out pillar to
the<00:02:00.470> rear<00:02:00.650> let's<00:02:00.830> walk<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.190> back<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.520> look

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
the rear let's walk to the back and look

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.890 
the rear let's walk to the back and look
at<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.330> because<00:02:02.480> that's<00:02:02.660> such<00:02:02.780> an

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
at that because that's such an

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.020 
at that because that's such an
interesting<00:02:03.260> feature<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.370> what<00:02:04.760> was<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
interesting feature so what was the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020 
interesting feature so what was the
design<00:02:05.390> goal<00:02:06.320> here<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.490> not<00:02:07.580> talked<00:02:07.790> about

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
design goal here it's not talked about

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
design goal here it's not talked about
this<00:02:08.119> area<00:02:08.360> yeah<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.050> basically<00:02:09.350> we<00:02:09.710> studied

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this area yeah so basically we studied

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.699 
this area yeah so basically we studied
the<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.580> windows<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.350> 360-degree<00:02:12.350> cinema

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the the windows as a 360-degree cinema

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.560 
the the windows as a 360-degree cinema
screen<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.280> what<00:02:13.490> we<00:02:13.580> wanted<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.090> people

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
screen so what we wanted is to people

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.320 
screen so what we wanted is to people
get<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.840> panoramic<00:02:15.620> view<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> sit

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
get this panoramic view so when you sit

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.550 
get this panoramic view so when you sit
inside<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.660> car<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:18.080> feel<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.440> you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
inside the car you can feel that you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.930 
inside the car you can feel that you
know<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> windows<00:02:19.130> are<00:02:19.250> wrapping<00:02:19.550> around<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
know the windows are wrapping around you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.210 
know the windows are wrapping around you
and<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> point<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.650> develop<00:02:22.070> for

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and so this is the point we develop for

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.090 
and so this is the point we develop for
this<00:02:22.400> also<00:02:22.850> as<00:02:23.300> lots<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.840> other<00:02:24.200> makers<00:02:24.740> are

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
this also as lots of other makers are

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.970 
this also as lots of other makers are
actually<00:02:25.820> blacking<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:27.440> pillar<00:02:27.740> we

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
actually blacking out the a pillar we

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.170 
actually blacking out the a pillar we
wanted<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.250> do<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> opposite<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.030> try

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
wanted to do the opposite and try

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
wanted to do the opposite and try
something<00:02:29.390> comes<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> bit<00:02:29.810> different<00:02:30.170> so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
something comes a bit different so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960 
something comes a bit different so
because<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.100> that's<00:02:31.250> right

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
because that's what we do that's right

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.240 
because that's what we do that's right
different<00:02:32.390> things<00:02:32.770> talked<00:02:33.770> about<00:02:33.980> lighting

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
different things talked about lighting

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.920 
different things talked about lighting
because<00:02:35.060> lighting<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> places

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
because lighting is one of the places

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
because lighting is one of the places
where<00:02:36.370> there's<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.459> lot<00:02:37.490> of<00:02:37.610> creative

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
where there's a lot of creative

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
where there's a lot of creative
opportunities<00:02:38.090> yeah<00:02:38.990> but<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.890> automakers

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
opportunities yeah but but automakers

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.800 
opportunities yeah but but automakers
have<00:02:40.520> designers<00:02:41.480> haven't<00:02:41.720> necessarily

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
have designers haven't necessarily

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020 
have designers haven't necessarily
tapped<00:02:42.350> into<00:02:42.530> all<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.769> them<00:02:43.100> it's<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:43.910> like

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
tapped into all of them it's just like

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970 
tapped into all of them it's just like
an<00:02:44.209> LED<00:02:44.360> cell<00:02:44.840> yeah<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.230> all<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.739> say<00:02:45.950> you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
an LED cell yeah so all of this say you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.830 
an LED cell yeah so all of this say you
can<00:02:46.310> see<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.610> small<00:02:46.820> LED<00:02:47.269> block<00:02:47.450> there<00:02:47.690> light

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
can see this small LED block there light

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.990 
can see this small LED block there light
and<00:02:48.470> what<00:02:48.980> we<00:02:49.100> wanted<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.580> keep<00:02:49.760> them

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and what we wanted is to keep them

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.850 
and what we wanted is to keep them
relatively<00:02:50.420> simple<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.140> not<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.500> over

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
relatively simple and not you know over

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.830 
relatively simple and not you know over
design<00:02:52.190> them<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:52.820> can<00:02:53.000> keep<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.390> freshness

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
design them so we can keep a freshness

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.660 
design them so we can keep a freshness
and<00:02:54.019> impact<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> design<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.340> so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and impact in the design yeah so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
and impact in the design yeah so
especially<00:02:56.150> that's<00:02:56.540> why<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:56.840> we<00:02:57.080> chose<00:02:57.260> in

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
especially that's why we we chose in

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.380 
especially that's why we we chose in
this<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:58.280> know<00:02:58.310> clock<00:02:58.610> pattern<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.180> can

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
this you know clock pattern so you can

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.729 
this you know clock pattern so you can
see<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.690> also<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.170> front<00:03:00.320> headlights

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
see that also on the front headlights

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.040 
see that also on the front headlights
I'm<00:03:00.980> curious<00:03:01.280> about<00:03:01.580> color<00:03:02.239> cuz<00:03:02.660> yeah<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
I'm curious about color cuz yeah you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.750 
I'm curious about color cuz yeah you
know<00:03:03.140> when<00:03:03.260> coming<00:03:03.500> up<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.800> color<00:03:04.400> for<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
know when coming up with a color for the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.330 
know when coming up with a color for the
odd<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> concept<00:03:06.170> car<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:07.010> know<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.130> want

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
odd for a concept car you know you want

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.410 
odd for a concept car you know you want
something<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:07.640> grabs<00:03:08.000> people's<00:03:08.330> attention

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
something that grabs people's attention

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.020 
something that grabs people's attention
how<00:03:09.019> did<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.260> decide<00:03:09.560> on<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.940> had

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
how did you decide on this so it had

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.610 
how did you decide on this so it had
lots<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.299> tries<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.750> color<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.380> wanted

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
lots of tries on the color and we wanted

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.020 
lots of tries on the color and we wanted
a<00:03:12.709> car<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:13.040> would<00:03:13.130> be<00:03:13.310> striking<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
a car that would be striking and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.760 
a car that would be striking and
emotional

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
emotional

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.280 
emotional
so<00:03:15.460> we<00:03:15.790> saw<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:15.940> orange<00:03:16.360> was<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:17.080> so

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
so we saw that orange was really good so

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.840 
so we saw that orange was really good so
this<00:03:17.470> paint<00:03:17.710> was<00:03:17.950> developed<00:03:18.310> only<00:03:18.580> for<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
this paint was developed only for this

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.640 
this paint was developed only for this
car<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.210> we<00:03:19.630> have<00:03:19.840> this<00:03:19.930> orange<00:03:20.230> base<00:03:20.440> with

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
car and we have this orange base with

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.170 
car and we have this orange base with
some<00:03:20.830> green<00:03:21.070> fall<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.910> has<00:03:21.940> this

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
some green fall on it so it has this

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.330 
some green fall on it so it has this
unique<00:03:22.420> reflection<00:03:23.130> interesting<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.280> I

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
unique reflection interesting and I

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.480 
unique reflection interesting and I
notice<00:03:24.580> there's<00:03:25.330> some<00:03:25.900> some<00:03:26.110> some<00:03:26.530> dark<00:03:27.280> works

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
notice there's some some some dark works

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.940 
notice there's some some some dark works
and<00:03:27.700> black<00:03:27.850> lines<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.420> top<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:29.650> talk<00:03:29.830> about

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
and black lines on top you talk about

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.400 
and black lines on top you talk about
that<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.340> terms<00:03:30.460> of<00:03:30.640> graphics<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.410> not

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
that in terms of graphics and not

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.500 
that in terms of graphics and not
overdoing<00:03:32.860> graphics<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.490> this<00:03:33.580> yeah<00:03:33.790> so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
overdoing graphics on this yeah so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.820 
overdoing graphics on this yeah so
basically<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.990> roof<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.380> wanted<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.710> show

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
basically the roof we wanted to show

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.230 
basically the roof we wanted to show
something<00:03:36.040> different<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.880> would<00:03:37.000> have<00:03:37.090> to

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
something different and we would have to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.670 
something different and we would have to
show<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.450> owners<00:03:37.990> can<00:03:38.050> actually<00:03:38.500> customize

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
show that owners can actually customize

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.950 
show that owners can actually customize
the<00:03:39.130> roof<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.270> basically<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> roof<00:03:40.840> is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
the roof and so basically the roof is

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.360 
the roof and so basically the roof is
made<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.230> one<00:03:41.380> piece<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.680> glass<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.190> can

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
made of one piece of glass and you can

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.860 
made of one piece of glass and you can
imagine<00:03:42.520> that<00:03:42.730> people<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:43.240> display<00:03:43.720> the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
imagine that people can display the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.810 
imagine that people can display the
image<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.230> pollen<00:03:44.470> they<00:03:44.560> want<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.640> bit

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
image of pollen they want so it's a bit

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.390 
image of pollen they want so it's a bit
like<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> tattoo<00:03:46.240> if<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.660> want<00:03:46.870> mmm<00:03:47.230> yeah<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.740> so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
like a tattoo if you want mmm yeah so so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.980 
like a tattoo if you want mmm yeah so so
the<00:03:48.760> good<00:03:48.910> point<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.240> roof<00:03:49.390> also<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.960> that

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
the good point of the roof also is that

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.450 
the good point of the roof also is that
it's<00:03:50.290> glass<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:51.040> means<00:03:51.190> when<00:03:51.340> you're

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
it's glass so that means when you're

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.770 
it's glass so that means when you're
sitting<00:03:51.700> inside<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.030> car<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.330> can<00:03:52.480> see<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
sitting inside the car you can see the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.600 
sitting inside the car you can see the
pattern<00:03:53.110> but<00:03:53.560> are<00:03:53.710> there<00:03:54.040> any<00:03:54.070> other<00:03:54.250> features

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
pattern but are there any other features

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.480 
pattern but are there any other features
that<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:55.800> people<00:03:56.800> should<00:03:56.950> take<00:03:57.100> notes

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
that that people should take notes

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.100 
that that people should take notes
because<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.120> when<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.330> actually<00:03:58.810> get

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
because you know when you actually get

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.600 
because you know when you actually get
up<00:03:59.200> closer<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.770> touch<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> vehicle<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.550> you

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
up closer you touch a vehicle and you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.370 
up closer you touch a vehicle and you
see<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.180> person<00:04:01.270> there<00:04:01.870> are<00:04:01.930> details<00:04:02.260> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
see it in person there are details that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.140 
see it in person there are details that
jump<00:04:02.680> out<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.370> may<00:04:03.490> not<00:04:03.640> notice<00:04:03.850> you

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
jump out that you may not notice you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.210 
jump out that you may not notice you

like<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.590> asymmetrical<00:04:08.940> Tama<00:04:09.940> for<00:04:10.270> the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
like the asymmetrical Tama for the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.590 
like the asymmetrical Tama for the
exhaust<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.140> fog<00:04:11.290> lamps<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.360> yeah<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.390> can

exhaust and the fog lamps and yeah I can

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.570 
exhaust and the fog lamps and yeah I can
keep<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.960> symmetrical<00:04:14.860> volume<00:04:15.370> but

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
keep this symmetrical volume but

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.070 
keep this symmetrical volume but
basically<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.090> graphics<00:04:16.480> are<00:04:16.600> different<00:04:16.959> so

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
basically the graphics are different so

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.539 
basically the graphics are different so
it<00:04:17.230> shows<00:04:17.410> something<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.799> bit<00:04:17.950> more<00:04:18.340> exciting

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
it shows something a bit more exciting

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.729 
it shows something a bit more exciting
about<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.210> it's<00:04:19.600> really<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:19.870> also<00:04:19.989> a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
about this it's really it's also a

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.680 
about this it's really it's also a
silent<00:04:21.250> cue<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.790> we've<00:04:21.940> been<00:04:22.180> using<00:04:22.360> on<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
silent cue that we've been using on the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.960 
silent cue that we've been using on the
fuse<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.110> diversity<00:04:23.710> yeah<00:04:23.920> previously<00:04:24.520> kind

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
fuse and diversity yeah previously kind

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.760 
fuse and diversity yeah previously kind
of<00:04:25.060> thing<00:04:25.240> by<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.050> way<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.170> noticed<00:04:26.530> you've<00:04:26.650> got

do anything this that's up to them to
decide<00:04:37.810> well<00:04:38.290> we<00:04:38.410> wanted<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.680> give<00:04:38.860> them<00:04:39.010> like

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
decide well we wanted to give them like

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.370 
decide well we wanted to give them like
a<00:04:39.190> canvas<00:04:39.490> like<00:04:39.910> just<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.180> base<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.900> we<00:04:41.020> decided

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
a canvas like just a base so we decided

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.230 
a canvas like just a base so we decided
to<00:04:41.530> set<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.040> on<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.370> 18th<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:43.120> then

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
to set this up on the 18th so then

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.880 
to set this up on the 18th so then
people<00:04:43.390> can<00:04:43.720> imagine<00:04:44.110> or<00:04:44.200> even<00:04:44.410> welcome

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
people can imagine or even welcome

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.860 
people can imagine or even welcome
Photoshop<00:04:45.310> under<00:04:45.580> our<00:04:46.150> pictures<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.690> put

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
Photoshop under our pictures and put

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.340 
Photoshop under our pictures and put
bigger<00:04:47.110> ones<00:04:47.350> well<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.550> does<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.360> reflect<00:04:49.780> is

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
bigger ones well so does this reflect is

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.600 
bigger ones well so does this reflect is
this<00:04:50.530> one<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.740> those<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.310> know<00:04:51.400> some<00:04:51.580> of

this one of those that you know some of

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.040 
this one of those that you know some of
these<00:04:51.760> features<00:04:52.150> may<00:04:52.300> appear<00:04:52.630> on<00:04:52.660> future

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
these features may appear on future

brush or does this hint at some sort of
product<00:04:57.100> maybe<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.940> design<00:04:58.210> study<00:04:58.390> so

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
product maybe this is a design study so

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.150 
product maybe this is a design study so
what<00:04:58.780> we<00:04:58.840> wanted<00:04:59.080> is<00:04:59.230> you<00:04:59.380> know<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.650> check

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
what we wanted is you know to check

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.010 
what we wanted is you know to check
people's<00:05:00.490> reaction<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.180> then

people's reaction so then

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.900 
people's reaction so then
we'll<00:05:02.229> think<00:05:02.440> about<00:05:02.740> everything<00:05:03.310> later<00:05:03.610> on

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
we'll think about everything later on

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.040 
we'll think about everything later on
but<00:05:04.150> first<00:05:04.389> we<00:05:04.509> want<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.720> see<00:05:04.840> what<00:05:04.960> people

but first we want to see what people
think<00:05:05.319> of<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.590> well<00:05:06.100> what's<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.340> reaction

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
think of this well what's the reaction

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
positive yeah I can imagine it's if you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.430 
positive yeah I can imagine it's if you
know<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.349> car<00:05:11.500> has<00:05:11.680> really<00:05:11.979> emotion<00:05:12.550> in<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.789> so

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
know the car has really emotion in it so

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.170 
know the car has really emotion in it so
so<00:05:14.440> people<00:05:14.710> got<00:05:14.830> excited<00:05:14.949> about<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.880> that's

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
so people got excited about it so that's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.879 
so people got excited about it so that's
fun<00:05:16.389> because<00:05:16.660> we<00:05:16.750> had<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.319> much<00:05:17.440> fun<00:05:17.500> during

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
fun because we had so much fun during

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.249 
fun because we had so much fun during
that<00:05:18.009> car<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.539> it's<00:05:19.539> gonna<00:05:19.660> ask<00:05:19.840> there's<00:05:20.139> sort

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
that car so it's gonna ask there's sort

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.529 
that car so it's gonna ask there's sort
of<00:05:20.319> like<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:20.740> forward<00:05:21.160> rake<00:05:21.490> when<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.300> look<00:05:22.419> at

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
of like a forward rake when you look at

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.180 
of like a forward rake when you look at
it<00:05:22.660> from<00:05:22.810> from<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.169> side<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.650> profile<00:05:24.009> it

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
it from from the side the profile it

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.339 
it from from the side the profile it
almost<00:05:24.430> looks<00:05:24.669> like<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:25.810> know<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.020> Munster

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
almost looks like you know the Munster

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.080 
almost looks like you know the Munster
mobile<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:27.069> of<00:05:27.160> like<00:05:27.310> that<00:05:27.460> sort<00:05:27.639> of<00:05:27.699> vaguely

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
mobile and of like that sort of vaguely

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.140 
mobile and of like that sort of vaguely
forward<00:05:29.340> what<00:05:30.340> was<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.520> inspiration<00:05:30.729> for

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
forward what was the inspiration for

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.330 
forward what was the inspiration for
that<00:05:31.330> design<00:05:31.720> so<00:05:32.440> basically<00:05:32.860> we<00:05:33.220> were

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
that design so basically we were

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.670 
that design so basically we were
inspired<00:05:33.610> by<00:05:33.970> American<00:05:34.840> Vintage<00:05:34.990> roadsters

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
inspired by American Vintage roadsters

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.189 
inspired by American Vintage roadsters
and<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.070> know<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.610> we<00:05:37.599> wanted<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.080> be

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
and you know and we wanted it to be

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.930 
and you know and we wanted it to be
really<00:05:38.470> dramatic<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:39.370> we<00:05:39.520> thought<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:39.820> was<00:05:39.910> a

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
really dramatic so we thought that was a

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.230 
really dramatic so we thought that was a
good<00:05:40.120> way<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.330> expressing<00:05:40.720> this<00:05:41.050> drama<00:05:41.949> yes<00:05:42.910> it

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
good way of expressing this drama yes it

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.279 
good way of expressing this drama yes it
certainly<00:05:43.419> is<00:05:43.599> dramatic

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
certainly is dramatic

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.839 
certainly is dramatic
especially<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:44.979> rake<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.370> very<00:05:45.550> unique<00:05:45.789> to

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
especially the rake is very unique to

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.580 
especially the rake is very unique to
this<00:05:46.030> car<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.509> we<00:05:46.870> saw<00:05:46.990> they<00:05:47.110> gave<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.470> a

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
this car and we saw they gave it a

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.409 
this car and we saw they gave it a
really<00:05:47.770> strong<00:05:48.039> attitude<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.699> they<00:05:49.270> up

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
really strong attitude and they up

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.969 
really strong attitude and they up
stance<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:49.900> everyone<00:05:50.289> can<00:05:50.410> get<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.650> message

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
stance so everyone can get the message

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.379 
stance so everyone can get the message
well<00:05:51.340> if<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.490> want<00:05:51.639> an<00:05:51.729> attitude<00:05:52.150> you've

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
well if you want an attitude you've

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.420 
well if you want an attitude you've
certainly<00:05:52.870> achieved<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.470> Thomas<00:05:53.860> Bergeron

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
certainly achieved that Thomas Bergeron

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.890 
certainly achieved that Thomas Bergeron
