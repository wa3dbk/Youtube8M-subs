00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
incredibly cheap ok so first thing you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
incredibly cheap ok so first thing you
do<00:00:39.090> make<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:39.899> attacker<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> march<00:00:41.489> all

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
do make an attacker have it march all

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
do make an attacker have it march all
the<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.149> there<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.840> tankers<00:00:43.530> are

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the way down there because tankers are

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
the way down there because tankers are
the<00:00:43.920> fastest<00:00:44.340> units<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the fastest units you get now as you can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.069 
the fastest units you get now as you can
see<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:47.160> line<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.570> place

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
see that line is where you can place

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.740 
see that line is where you can place
your<00:00:49.110> units<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> highest<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.390> your

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
your units or the highest point or your

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
your units or the highest point or your
lowest<00:00:52.079> point<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.800> place<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.129> units

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
lowest point you can place your units

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
lowest point you can place your units
but<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:54.629> part<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.320> unit<00:00:55.649> goes

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
but as you're part of this unit goes

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.209 
but as you're part of this unit goes
down<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.410> units<00:00:58.829> farther

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
down you can place your units farther

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.360 
down you can place your units farther
and<00:00:59.430> farther<00:00:59.609> away<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.510> shaft<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and farther away from the shaft and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
and farther away from the shaft and
eventually<00:01:02.449> practically<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> bottom<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
eventually practically to the bottom and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
eventually practically to the bottom and
you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.159> place<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.850> units<00:01:06.150> wherever

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you can just place your units wherever

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.500 
you can just place your units wherever
you<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.900> them<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.350> convenient<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.909> meet

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you want them to be convenient to meet

the<00:01:09.630> enemy<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:10.380> away<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.979> don't<00:01:11.070> have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the enemy right away so you don't have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.090 
the enemy right away so you don't have

enemy right away with the exact
appropriate<00:01:49.670> unit<00:01:49.940> instead<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.300> like<00:01:50.960> having

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
appropriate unit instead of like having

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.930 
appropriate unit instead of like having
fighters<00:01:51.880> meet<00:01:52.880> up<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.240> Emmys<00:01:53.630> wherever<00:01:54.940> you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
in this instance I would normally want a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.440 
in this instance I would normally want a
fighter<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.490> meet<00:02:01.640> up<00:02:01.759> with<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.060> barbarian

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
fighter to meet up with that barbarian

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
because now my defender is going to get

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.760 
because now my defender is going to get
wailed<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.270> by<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.660> wyvern<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.440> want<00:02:09.709> to

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
wailed on by that wyvern so I want to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.229 
wailed on by that wyvern so I want to
see<00:02:09.979> if<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.369> my<00:02:10.489> defender<00:02:10.880> out<00:02:11.120> of

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239

there<00:02:11.590> problem<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.800> shooters<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:14.030> if

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
there problem with shooters is that if

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.910 
there problem with shooters is that if
you<00:02:14.450> tell<00:02:14.720> them<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.020> attack<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.560> enemy

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
you tell them to attack on enemy

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.979 
you tell them to attack on enemy
sometimes<00:02:16.820> they'll<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.060> shoot<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.630> from<00:02:17.900> a

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
sometimes they'll just shoot it from a

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.420 
sometimes they'll just shoot it from a
range<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.530> they'll<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:18.890> sit<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.190> their

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
range and then they'll just sit on their

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.960 
range and then they'll just sit on their
ass<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.209> won't<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.660> anything<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:22.670> got<00:02:22.820> to

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
ass and won't do anything so you got to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.610 
ass and won't do anything so you got to
keep<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.269> telling<00:02:23.660> them<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.959> attack<00:02:24.290> sometimes

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
keep on telling them to attack sometimes

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.550 
keep on telling them to attack sometimes
if<00:02:25.459> they<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:26.299> like<00:02:26.510> directly<00:02:27.080> encounter

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
if they don't like directly encounter

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.650 
if they don't like directly encounter
the<00:02:27.680> enemy<00:02:28.269> got<00:02:29.269> him<00:02:29.570> oh<00:02:30.760> look<00:02:31.760> we<00:02:32.299> defeated

the enemy got him oh look we defeated

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.740 
the enemy got him oh look we defeated
all<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.900> enemies<00:02:33.470> voila<00:02:34.250> no<00:02:35.060> commander<00:02:35.600> or

all the enemies voila no commander or
anything<00:02:36.489> apparently<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.880> way<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
anything apparently the way the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.289 
anything apparently the way the
programming<00:02:38.750> works<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.220> defeat<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
programming works is if you defeat the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.350 
programming works is if you defeat the
enemy<00:02:41.860> all<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.130> enemies<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.670> screen<00:02:43.790> that
