00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
now I'm stuck with zero volts alright

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
now I'm stuck with zero volts alright
let's<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.190> if<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:51.649> 0<00:01:52.649> volts<00:01:53.220> alright<00:01:53.600> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
let's see if I can 0 volts alright this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.680 
let's see if I can 0 volts alright this
is<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> negative<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.590> course<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.729> battery

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
is the negative of course of the battery

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.029 
is the negative of course of the battery
thing<00:01:58.250> alright<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.880> gonna<00:02:00.030> put<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.479> on

thing alright so I'm gonna put this on

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.469 
thing alright so I'm gonna put this on
the<00:02:02.039> positive<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> battery<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.240> then

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the positive of the battery and then

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.870 
the positive of the battery and then
we'll<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> negative<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
we'll put this on the negative and you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
we'll put this on the negative and you
see<00:02:06.060> how<00:02:06.210> we're<00:02:06.390> still<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.750> zero<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.979> right

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
see how we're still at zero all right

it<00:02:28.739> off<00:02:29.510> alright<00:02:30.510> give<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.440> second<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.610> it's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it off alright give it a second but it's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.770 
it off alright give it a second but it's
basically<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:34.020> 5<00:02:34.260> amps<00:02:34.680> DC<00:02:35.330> charging<00:02:36.330> force

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
basically at 5 amps DC charging force

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.900 
basically at 5 amps DC charging force

they<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.250> 20<00:03:09.640> volts<00:03:11.129> that's<00:03:12.129> how<00:03:12.340> simple<00:03:12.400> it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
they have 20 volts that's how simple it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.030 
they have 20 volts that's how simple it
is<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.120> tricks<00:03:13.599> your<00:03:13.720> charger<00:03:14.140> into<00:03:14.349> giving<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
is it tricks your charger into giving a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.729 
is it tricks your charger into giving a
deep<00:03:15.370> charge<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.019> battery<00:03:17.410> charger

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
deep charge because the battery charger

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.520 
deep charge because the battery charger
already<00:03:18.160> knows<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.230> already<00:03:20.230> sort<00:03:20.470> of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
already knows that it's already sort of

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.570 
already knows that it's already sort of
bed<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.400> do<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.790> quick<00:03:22.510> loose<00:03:22.959> charge<00:03:23.580> about

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
bed you do the quick loose charge about

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.570 
bed you do the quick loose charge about
2<00:03:24.880> 3<00:03:25.300> 4<00:03:25.599> time<00:03:25.780> maybe<00:03:26.170> 5<00:03:26.470> times<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.430> can

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
2 3 4 time maybe 5 times but you can

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.770 
2 3 4 time maybe 5 times but you can
only<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.120> couple<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.360> seconds<00:03:28.690> of

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
only do it for a couple of seconds of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.960 
only do it for a couple of seconds of
peace<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.920> tricks<00:03:30.160> your<00:03:30.280> batteries<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.819> see

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
peace it tricks your batteries you see

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.610 
peace it tricks your batteries you see
how<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.150> voltage<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.660> dropping<00:03:31.870> from<00:03:32.200> twenty

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
how the voltage is dropping from twenty

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.850 
how the voltage is dropping from twenty
point<00:03:32.890> nine<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.430> twenty<00:03:33.790> point<00:03:34.470> seven<00:03:35.470> point

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
point nine to twenty point seven point

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.890 
point nine to twenty point seven point
six<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> couple<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.510> times<00:03:37.569> then

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
six you do that a couple of times then

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.690 
six you do that a couple of times then
it<00:03:37.989> will<00:03:38.110> stay<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.440> exactly<00:03:38.980> twenty<00:03:39.370> point<00:03:39.610> one

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
it will stay of exactly twenty point one

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.440 
it will stay of exactly twenty point one
volts<00:03:39.989> for<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.500> really<00:03:42.430> long<00:03:42.610> time<00:03:42.670> basically

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
volts for a really long time basically

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.199 
volts for a really long time basically
it<00:03:43.540> just<00:03:44.400> energizes<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.519> battery<00:03:45.819> gedan

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
it just energizes the battery gedan

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.240 
it just energizes the battery gedan
breaks<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.599> calcium<00:03:46.900> taste<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.920> memory

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
breaks all the calcium taste a memory

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.030 
breaks all the calcium taste a memory
effect<00:03:48.549> away<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.239> quick<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
effect away from that really quick and

effect away from that really quick and
then<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.400> put<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> charger<00:03:52.120> and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
then you put it on the charger and

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.620 
then you put it on the charger and
you're<00:03:53.019> done<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.440> works<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.040> charges<00:03:54.630> blow
