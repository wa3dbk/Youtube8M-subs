00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
solid spot for it not the turn so it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830

do<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.320> same<00:01:35.620> for<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.920> other<00:01:36.010> side<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.280> play

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.240 

the<00:01:41.960> other<00:01:42.110> way<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.320> could<00:01:42.530> do<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:42.979> like<00:01:43.100> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the other way I could do it I like to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.170 
the other way I could do it I like to
use<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> 90<00:01:44.479> degree<00:01:44.630> die<00:01:45.200> grinder<00:01:45.729> with<00:01:46.729> rowlock

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
use a 90 degree die grinder with rowlock

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.539 
use a 90 degree die grinder with rowlock
discs<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.869> just<00:01:48.110> basically<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:49.250> want<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
discs you just basically just want to

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.630 
discs you just basically just want to
turn<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.539> just<00:01:50.810> keep<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.140> same

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
turn it on and you just keep the same

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.700 
turn it on and you just keep the same
blade<00:01:52.640> angle<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:54.049> don't<00:01:54.229> want<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.470> sharpen

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
blade angle you don't want to sharpen

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.560 
blade angle you don't want to sharpen
the<00:01:54.950> other<00:01:55.189> side<00:01:55.490> other<00:01:55.789> side<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.360> blade

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
the other side other side of the blade

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.590 
the other side other side of the blade
what<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.679> do<00:01:57.830> however<00:01:58.039> want<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.729> just<00:01:59.030> take

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.130 

so<00:02:12.850> basically<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.540> when<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> get<00:02:13.990> done

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so basically you know when you get done

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.800 
so basically you know when you get done
you<00:02:14.200> gotta<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.520> flat<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.690> just

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.730 
taking the burrs off and you got a razor
sharp<00:02:21.460> here<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:23.020> don't<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> sharpen

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740

them so sharp that it will shave hair

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.190 
them so sharp that it will shave hair
but<00:02:29.430> yeah<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:31.570> good<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.840> go<00:02:31.990> or<00:02:32.830> Inchon
