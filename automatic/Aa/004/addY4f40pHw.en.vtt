but I don't know if they go so overtly
into<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> books<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> did<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

full<00:01:48.869> circle<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> thought<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
full circle I thought this was a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
full circle I thought this was a
spectacular<00:01:50.670> trip<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.270> also<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.990> like

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
spectacular trip and I also really like

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.399 
spectacular trip and I also really like
part<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
part one it was not what you know the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
part one it was not what you know the
other<00:01:55.560> films<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.040> been<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.729> action

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
other films have been it is not action

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
other films have been it is not action
centric<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.259> doubt<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.710> just

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
centric it is not in doubt but I just

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
centric it is not in doubt but I just
felt<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.790> well<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:00.990> done
