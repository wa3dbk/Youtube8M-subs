00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
touching the strings it just looks like

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.320 
touching the strings it just looks like
it<00:03:45.709> my<00:03:46.709> ring<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.910> get<00:03:48.090> that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
chord which is really simple since you

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.180

I'm<00:04:39.010> going<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.370> do<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> much<00:04:39.850> simpler<00:04:40.410> strum

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
I'm going to do a much simpler strum

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.670 
I'm going to do a much simpler strum
which<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:43.660> or<00:04:43.810> less<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> country<00:04:44.500> bass

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
which is a more or less a country bass

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.080 
which is a more or less a country bass
drum<00:04:45.070> it's<00:04:45.810> incredibly<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:50.560> it's<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.280> huge

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
drum it's incredibly it it's a huge

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.870 
drum it's incredibly it it's a huge
number<00:04:52.420> of<00:04:52.450> songs<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:54.520> it's<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.730> great

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
number of songs and so it's a great

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:21.490 
number of songs and so it's a great
strong<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.480> learn<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:57.220> goes<00:04:57.460> like<00:04:57.490> this

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.270 

you

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
you

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.270 
you
so<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.490> is<00:05:24.880> not<00:05:25.330> good<00:05:25.510> at<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:26.190> naming<00:05:27.190> of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
so that is not good at the naming of

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:35.679 
so that is not good at the naming of
what<00:05:27.460> you're<00:05:27.610> doing

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:42.010 

so<00:05:36.349> a<00:05:36.619> full<00:05:36.919> measure<00:05:37.129> is<00:05:37.459> down

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.570 

but<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.039> this<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.300> technique<00:05:45.580> that

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
but and this is a technique that

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.999 
but and this is a technique that
involves<00:05:47.180> what's<00:05:47.599> called<00:05:47.840> go<00:05:48.080> strumming<00:05:48.620> so

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
involves what's called go strumming so

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.969 
involves what's called go strumming so
notice<00:05:49.430> that<00:05:50.330> when<00:05:50.930> I'm<00:05:51.110> switching<00:05:51.650> between

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
notice that when I'm switching between

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.490 
notice that when I'm switching between
down<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.729> ups<00:05:52.970> I'm<00:05:53.629> not<00:05:53.900> playing<00:05:53.960> the

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
down and ups I'm not playing the

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.469 
down and ups I'm not playing the
upstroke<00:05:55.220> we're<00:05:55.789> not<00:05:55.940> playing<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.300> down

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
upstroke we're not playing the down

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.770 
upstroke we're not playing the down
stroke<00:05:56.840> I'm<00:05:57.110> not<00:05:57.500> stopping<00:05:58.280> my<00:05:58.699> scrubbing<00:05:59.090> my

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
stroke I'm not stopping my scrubbing my

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.080 
stroke I'm not stopping my scrubbing my
strumming<00:06:00.259> goes<00:06:00.440> at<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:00.979> same<00:06:01.310> pace<00:06:01.550> all<00:06:01.849> the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
strumming goes at the same pace all the

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.730 
strumming goes at the same pace all the
time<00:06:02.300> only<00:06:03.050> for<00:06:03.729> some<00:06:04.729> scrums<00:06:05.180> I'm<00:06:05.740> hitting

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
time only for some scrums I'm hitting

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.740 
time only for some scrums I'm hitting
the<00:06:06.830> strings<00:06:07.099> and<00:06:07.490> from<00:06:07.819> ghost<00:06:08.120> crumbs<00:06:08.479> I'm

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
the strings and from ghost crumbs I'm

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.770 
the strings and from ghost crumbs I'm
