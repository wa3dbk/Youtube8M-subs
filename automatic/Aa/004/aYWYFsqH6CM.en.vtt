00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.370 
who didn't jump fluently early on and I
certainly<00:00:35.820> don't<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.390> helped<00:00:36.899> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
certainly don't think that helped and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.069

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
effects of what I durable also and so is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330 
effects of what I durable also and so is

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.930 
horse at the race and using early sticks
on<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.630> know<00:03:40.900> he<00:03:40.959> battles<00:03:41.590> he's<00:03:42.459> never<00:03:42.670> been

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
on you know he battles he's never been

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.150 
on you know he battles he's never been
beaten<00:03:43.540> once<00:03:43.870> he's<00:03:44.080> gotten<00:03:44.560> hit<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.920> front

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
beaten once he's gotten hit the front

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.320 
beaten once he's gotten hit the front
he's<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.850> pretty<00:03:46.209> remarkable<00:03:47.170> tool<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.519> just

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
he's a pretty remarkable tool and I just

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.620 
he's a pretty remarkable tool and I just
think<00:03:49.570> we<00:03:50.489> underestimate<00:03:51.489> him<00:03:51.700> slightly<00:03:52.180> at

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
think we underestimate him slightly at

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.650 
think we underestimate him slightly at
this<00:03:52.810> stage<00:03:53.110> probably<00:03:53.910> Barry<00:03:54.910> go<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.209> use<00:03:55.480> that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
this stage probably Barry go to use that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.050 
this stage probably Barry go to use that
great<00:03:55.870> expression<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.530> he<00:03:56.799> impersonates<00:03:57.790> a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
great expression that he impersonates a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.420 
great expression that he impersonates a
work<00:03:58.390> like<00:03:58.930> horse<00:03:59.260> for<00:03:59.560> there's<00:03:59.739> water<00:03:59.950> than

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
work like horse for there's water than

work like horse for there's water than
