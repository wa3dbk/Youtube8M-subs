armor came off and this this whole arm

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.379 
armor came off and this this whole arm
is<00:06:54.169> just<00:06:54.380> really<00:06:54.650> loose<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:55.159> the<00:06:55.969> shoulder

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
armor comes off really easily so uh I'll

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.309 
armor comes off really easily so uh I'll
address<00:07:01.009> that<00:07:01.310> more<00:07:01.550> in<00:07:01.759> detail<00:07:01.789> as<00:07:02.419> we<00:07:02.659> when<00:07:03.289> I
