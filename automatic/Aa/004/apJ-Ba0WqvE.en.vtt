move<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:23.119> okay<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
move I think it is okay so we have a

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.220 
move I think it is okay so we have a
quite<00:00:27.180> weird<00:00:27.630> hybrid<00:00:28.220> system<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.400> between

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230
