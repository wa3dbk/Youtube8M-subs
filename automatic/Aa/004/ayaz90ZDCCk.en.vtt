Bradshaw outdoors my kayak fishing fails
started<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.450> me<00:00:09.630> fishing<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.380> deep<00:00:10.800> weed<00:00:11.040> line

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
started with me fishing a deep weed line

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.660 
started with me fishing a deep weed line
where<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.730> had<00:00:11.880> dropped<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.330> well<00:00:12.630> 15<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.710> 20

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
where it had dropped from well 15 to 20

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.689 
where it had dropped from well 15 to 20
feet<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> weeds<00:00:15.839> dispersed<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.830> found<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
feet and the weeds dispersed I found a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.220 
feet and the weeds dispersed I found a
big<00:00:17.880> school<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.330> fish<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.020> holding

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
big school of fish that was holding

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
big school of fish that was holding
tight<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> bottom<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.970> picked<00:00:21.480> him<00:00:21.570> apart

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
tight to the bottom I picked him apart

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.349 
tight to the bottom I picked him apart
for<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> while<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> drop<00:00:23.160> shot<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
for a while with a drop shot when I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.630 
for a while with a drop shot when I
noticed<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.590> school<00:00:25.949> went<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> more

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
noticed that the school went to a more

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
noticed that the school went to a more
of<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> suspended<00:00:27.480> State<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.019> reeled<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.830> few

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
of a suspended State I reeled up a few

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.160 
of a suspended State I reeled up a few
feet<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.910> soon<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.269> did<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.720> something

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
feet and as soon as I did so something

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.510 
feet and as soon as I did so something
grabbed<00:00:31.410> ahold<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:31.949> bait<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:35.100> fish<00:00:35.130> felt

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
grabbed ahold of my bait the fish felt

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920 
grabbed ahold of my bait the fish felt
pretty<00:00:35.730> good<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> set<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> hook<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
pretty good when I set the hook into it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
pretty good when I set the hook into it
but<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> realized<00:00:37.860> shortly<00:00:38.640> afterwards<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but I realized shortly afterwards that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
but I realized shortly afterwards that
it<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.629> fighting<00:00:40.020> different<00:00:40.379> than<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it was fighting different than all the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.410 
it was fighting different than all the
bass<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> I'd<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.460> catching<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.940> day

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.610 

with<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> water<00:00:48.660> being<00:00:48.840> clear<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> lake

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
with the water being clear in this lake

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100 
with the water being clear in this lake
I<00:00:49.800> realized<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.430> caught<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> pike<00:00:51.079> not<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I realized I had caught a pike not a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
I realized I had caught a pike not a
bass<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> drop<00:00:53.010> shot<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> 8

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
bass on a drop shot and was on the 8

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.740 
bass on a drop shot and was on the 8
pound<00:00:54.360> floral<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:56.219> reached<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> net

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.709 

and<00:01:00.750> successfully<00:01:01.379> netted<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> fish<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
and successfully netted the fish and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.219 
and successfully netted the fish and
that's<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.379> interesting<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
that's when things got interesting I

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's when things got interesting I
noticed<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> fish<00:01:07.770> had<00:01:08.040> been<00:01:08.549> missing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
noticed that this fish had been missing

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
noticed that this fish had been missing
a<00:01:08.970> part<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> its<00:01:09.360> upper<00:01:09.630> jaw<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.200> left<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.710> lot

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
a part of its upper jaw which left a lot

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
a part of its upper jaw which left a lot
of<00:01:10.950> its<00:01:11.100> lower<00:01:11.310> teeth<00:01:11.549> exposed<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.990> reached

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
of its lower teeth exposed so I reached

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
of its lower teeth exposed so I reached
for<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> gill<00:01:13.860> plate<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.490> normally<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.030> with

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
for the gill plate as I normally do with

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.700 
for the gill plate as I normally do with
these<00:01:15.360> small<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> energetic<00:01:16.350> pike

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.410 

the<00:01:24.710> fishhook<00:01:25.130> twice<00:01:25.460> which<00:01:25.729> was<00:01:25.880> enough<00:01:26.149> to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the fishhook twice which was enough to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.179 
the fishhook twice which was enough to
skin<00:01:26.719> up<00:01:26.840> my<00:01:26.960> knuckles<00:01:27.380> pretty<00:01:27.649> good<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.069> the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
skin up my knuckles pretty good on the

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.389 
skin up my knuckles pretty good on the
edges<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.700> its<00:01:28.819> gills<00:01:32.740> at<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.979> moment<00:01:34.189> I

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
edges of its gills at that moment I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.709 
edges of its gills at that moment I
should<00:01:34.460> have<00:01:34.670> realized<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:35.329> fish<00:01:35.539> was

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
should have realized that this fish was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:48.250 
should have realized that this fish was
not<00:01:35.929> going<00:01:36.200> down<00:01:36.350> without<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.709> fight

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.950 

to<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.250> some<00:01:49.430> better<00:01:49.580> leverage<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.420> reach<00:01:50.720> back

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
to get some better leverage I reach back

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.110 
to get some better leverage I reach back
into<00:01:51.140> my<00:01:51.260> tackle<00:01:51.530> box<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.850> pair<00:01:53.090> of

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
into my tackle box to get a pair of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.350 
into my tackle box to get a pair of
pliers<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:55.310> that's<00:01:55.610> when<00:01:55.850> he<00:01:55.940> made<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> break

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
pliers and that's when he made a break

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.330 
pliers and that's when he made a break
for<00:01:56.600> it<00:02:02.080> not<00:02:03.080> wanting<00:02:03.440> this<00:02:03.560> fish<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.980> break<00:02:04.130> my

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
for it not wanting this fish to break my

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.930 
for it not wanting this fish to break my
line<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:05.030> moved<00:02:05.600> everything<00:02:05.780> off<00:02:06.260> my<00:02:06.500> rod<00:02:06.940> and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
line I moved everything off my rod and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.380 
line I moved everything off my rod and
went<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.300> reel<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.660> in

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
went to reel it in

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.670 
went to reel it in
that's<00:02:11.390> when<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.600> realized<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.290> line<00:02:12.470> was

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's when I realized the line was

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
that's when I realized the line was
wrapped<00:02:12.920> around<00:02:13.070> my<00:02:13.250> rod<00:02:13.460> tip<00:02:13.490> several<00:02:14.210> times

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
wrapped around my rod tip several times

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.660 
wrapped around my rod tip several times
preventing<00:02:15.440> me<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:15.620> reeling<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> fish<00:02:16.580> in

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
preventing me from reeling the fish in

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.370 
preventing me from reeling the fish in
so<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:19.790> little<00:02:20.060> time<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> waste<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.990> began

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
so with little time to waste I began

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.250 
so with little time to waste I began
hand<00:02:21.740> lining<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.520> fish<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.930> pond

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
hand lining in the fish on a pond

00:02:24.260 --> 00:03:00.850 
hand lining in the fish on a pond
fluorocarbon<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.370> about<00:02:25.580> 20<00:02:26.000> feet<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.360> water

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.710

and then I was finally able to pop the
hook<00:03:50.420> out<00:03:50.599> of<00:03:50.659> its<00:03:50.900> upper<00:03:51.170> jaw<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.390> I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
hook out of its upper jaw so that I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.990

this<00:04:05.610> was<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> most<00:04:06.060> ridiculous<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this was the most ridiculous and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.530 
this was the most ridiculous and
drawn-out<00:04:07.490> situation<00:04:08.490> that<00:04:08.640> I've<00:04:08.760> had<00:04:09.030> while

kayak fishing in the last few years I

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.510 
kayak fishing in the last few years I

that sometimes even the most easy and
