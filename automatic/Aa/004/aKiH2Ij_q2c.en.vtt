00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.109
 Then I'm from the south, together, I'll go 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.090
 teach you today how I do a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.719
 feijoada in quotes light but stay to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.390
 I was ok with taste here for oil 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.750
 Canola should have a tablespoon of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.189
 canola and it's onion and garlic 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.970
 My daughter is in those days when 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.400
 she does not like miscellaneous and polka dots 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.809
 opening the food and I beat onion the garlic 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.020
 no no on the crusher and turned grass 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.719
 so I put some in here and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 I let it go in the canola oil over 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.960
 or less a spoonful of oil only 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.960
 to spread the bottom 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:59.489
 Then I'll take the turkey terrine sausage. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.910
 a pack of that cut of 5 and I put 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.479
 now there in the pan 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.610
 so I put in addition to follow in. 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 You just have to spend a little time to get the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 the onion operator with the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.400
 so we do not use it, I do not use it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.990
 I use no fat, that's all. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.220
 this right here 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.110
 the mother then the beans I use when pass 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.140
 feijoada to be had at home and uses the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 black beans there are usually I put of 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.460
 a sauce overnight only 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 When I 'm in a hurry, just knife. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.920
 eat feijoada dinha I get the feijoada 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.830
 I now want the woman places 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.750
 amount of beans a and water 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.119
 and leave the 40 minutes it already 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.330
 It was molinha molinha scenario already breaks 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.140
 he gets soft so let him do it 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 now the young ones in the pan 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.350
 The weapon was absorbed having a 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.390
 little water 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.869
 sometimes until now make fun of not 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.640
 heartburn could leave when we've played 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:18.420
 So good, but if you want to take this tree 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:29.769
 just had the name put here a little bit 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 raise the fire and I will put salt cup 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.760
 it seems normal is not just on the line 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.990
 I'm going to touch it 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:03:00.500
 and I'm going to put boiling water for about three 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 times above the limb so up to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:11.150
 beans already I put pressure on 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 some 20 minutes 15 and 20 thousand always annoying 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.350
 it's quick 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:22.700
 I put pressure on it and it shows 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:25.880
 main result of them singing here 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.980
 Then I'll leave it for 15 and 20 thousand 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.330
 I had to go off to see if the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.840
 beans are ready 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.010
 then the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.010
 already the smoke has already taken me out of depression 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.000
 the nef jorginho beans 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.769
 but I thought it was a bit hard 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.660
 I think it was one of the 20 minutes more 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.360
 I thought it got a little hard beans 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.360
 I'll add another 10 minutes 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.600
 feijoada feijoada 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.289
 This is what it is really for who to whom. 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 doing food re-education or else 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.720
 to choose a healthier life as the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 case of ours here at home nor kind of 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.729
 want to eat feijoada is not that 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.120
 Heavy feijoada does not have those things 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.930
 little and such but she remembers the coxinha 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.610
 huh 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.879
 Finally, remembering the 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.840
 the feijoada because the sausage for more 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:47.180
 that she is from Peru she is smoked then 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.849
 beans got that smoked taste 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.830
 and that fat thing does not stay too 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.060
 in the broth it has practically no fat 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.849
 none 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.789
 practically one did not understand fat 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:05.479
 in it in the broth then it is a family game 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.400
 all with my children my husband and 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.819
 here at home and arrived at the point where 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 Strange people when they eat the kind 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.860
 original because of the curve lasted 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.729

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.819
 a mock noa and a salad to accompany 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.159

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:39.699
 contest is northeastern contest 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:42.650
 Moroccan to accompany her being pure is 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.690
 for boys and girls for the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.930
 children and for my husband even rice 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.909

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.949
