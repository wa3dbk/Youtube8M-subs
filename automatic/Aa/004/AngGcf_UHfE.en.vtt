00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.090
 hello friends this I want to show you here 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:11.090
 the polyamide fabric if closely look 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.870
 to see if you see there look at this is the 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.749
 texture of polyamide is medium 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.749
 transparent also see is as if 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:24.800
 it was similar to the winter can of 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:27.980
 the baby stockings if that is the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.679
 text look at the texture there it looks good 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.969
 I want you to see how you stretch 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.489
 look on one side stretches a lot and the 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.780
 another this means double bounce of the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.039
 two sides of stretches same see from one and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.829
 of the other then this is the polyamide 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.820
 I bring it back 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:55.000
 if they have an alternative other than 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.729
 iclam stockings look this for example 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.519
 is a mesh lining you could say of 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:04.019
 a clothes that I have with which I'm going to 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.340
 make a little mermaid later and look at this 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.140
 effort that serves for fabrics 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 transparent and look is stretched enough 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 on one side and on the other the same thing is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 it serves but look at this one this one is not 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 example see this also serves for the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.080
 tele when you put on a dress 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.240
 gauze 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.950
 this is the lining that goes down but look 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 on one side stretches beautiful but on the other 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 not stretch anything but look at little to no 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.820
 one stretches like chewing gum and the other does not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.610
 it is not useful last girls can 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 use of course but it is not the ideal yes 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 because he has to stretch the two 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 sides and this one I do not recommend 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 nothing this is called acetate is shiny 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.619
 from one side of the other no and also look 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.050
 one side stretches more or less and the other 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.020
 nothing is less than less good because 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.440
 stretches less than the previous one good with 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 these fabrics as I told you then is 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.140
 the polyamide and this one that is lining 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.870
 but as I told you, stretch well 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 both sides are the same if they are going to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.769
 to serve 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.019
 make dolls yes good I hope that you 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:27.540
 help and good if you find in your country 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.420
 please publish then with the name 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.239
