00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.040

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.040
 videos subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.599
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.060
 are 3 Mexican boats 250 grams of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.610
 ground beef a little bit of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.860
 cilantro or parsley in this case 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.519
 topping of cheddar cheese and mozzarella 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.010
 a large small or medium onion 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:43.160
 half red and green pepper cut in 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.280
 juliana a final mind chopped a 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.010
 spicy chilli pepper a little salt 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.980
 and olive oil the first thing we will do 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.540
 is to prepare our meat we put a 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.810
 skillet 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.040
 to strong fire at the beginning and then 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.020
 we will go down we throw oil 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.530
 to make our meat and our 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.690
 vegetables we will first throw the garlic one 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.580
 Once it is hot we will go down the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.620
 fire to the minimum I am that I have it in a 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.850
 big fire is the smallest fire what 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.850
 you can put on medium heat 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 when we do a little garlic 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.680
 we will throw the onion 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 we will not let it brown, it's a little bit 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 done and we are the onions 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 let's take a little salt for 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.840
 that the onion we car before 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.159
 we do not want it to be cold we want it 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.109
 that car 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.790
 that stays soft and transparent 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.950
 but not golden 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.260
 once we have the onion 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.260
 pochada let's go throwing the meat 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.260
 we shred it a little bit like that so 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.990
 do not stay a ball 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.580
 and now we are moving it 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.200
 we are going to take a little salt 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 because the meat has no salt 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.629
 and we're going to pour the hot pepper 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.239
 As you can see, I will be very little 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.340
 because it stings a lot and at home we do not like it 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 much the spicy but I'm comfortable 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.569
 you can take whatever you want 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:39.350
 we are going to make the parsley too 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.380
 and now we'll throw the peppers on 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.430
 green pepper and red pepper and what 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.430
 we will do a little 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.960
 then mix the meat with 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.320
 the cheese topping as still the 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.740
 we have warm it will melt us the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.740
 cheese 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.879
 and we are going to move it so that it is divided 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.099
 the cheese for all the meat this is my 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.160
 way to do it but you can 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.920
 do it as you want ingredients 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.080
 that you want to put to him from the meat 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.780
 what you want next 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.680
 fill the boats we are going 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 with a spoon 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.650
 a little in each conjunction you can 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.159
 add a little mozzarella cheese 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.340
 above and put a little gratin 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.200
 but you can take it as you see 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.060
 we have already presented in our little boat 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.730
 and as an accompaniment we have put 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.709
 fried potatoes seasoned because 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.019

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.209
