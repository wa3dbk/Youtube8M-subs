own high score thing and my my personal
record<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.659> only<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.170> 30<00:01:28.440> times<00:01:28.799> 1<00:01:29.280> 2<00:01:29.640> 3<00:01:29.909> 4<00:01:30.420> 5

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
record is only like 30 times 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
record is only like 30 times 1 2 3 4 5
if<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.280> so

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
if you're kind of going that way so

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.250 
if you're kind of going that way so
basically<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.810> trick<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
basically how you do this trick is

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.780 
basically how you do this trick is
you're<00:01:34.500> taking<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.820> big<00:01:36.060> cup<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.790> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you're taking the big cup right here and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.380 
you're taking the big cup right here and
the<00:01:39.780> base<00:01:39.990> cup<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.180> taking

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the base cup right here so you're taking

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.219 
the base cup right here so you're taking
the<00:01:43.200> ball<00:01:43.439> landing<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.820> big<00:01:45.030> cup<00:01:45.270> base

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the ball landing it on the big cup base

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.609 
the ball landing it on the big cup base
cup<00:01:46.619> big<00:01:47.130> cup<00:01:47.430> base<00:01:47.880> cup<00:01:48.180> big<00:01:48.540> cup<00:01:48.780> base<00:01:49.259> cup

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
cup big cup base cup big cup base cup

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
cup big cup base cup big cup base cup
all<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.950> however<00:01:52.950> long<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.490> get

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
all the way to however long you can get

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
all the way to however long you can get
it<00:01:53.729> too<00:01:54.140> ok<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.479> at<00:01:57.479> first<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:58.530> probably

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it too ok so at first you're probably

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.030 
it too ok so at first you're probably
your<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.659> trick<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.560> probably<00:02:01.950> going

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
your your your trick it's probably going

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.350 
your your your trick it's probably going
to<00:02:02.100> look<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:03.890> like<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
to look like this like that

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.120 
to look like this like that
either<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.470> better<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
either that or if you're better you

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.240 
either that or if you're better you
probably<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.329> then<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.709> that's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
probably get this and then that that's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.340 
probably get this and then that that's
that's<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:11.880> happened<00:02:12.329> when<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> first

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that's what happened when I first

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.840 
that's what happened when I first
started<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:13.980> eventually<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:14.820> enough

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
started but eventually with enough

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.170 
started but eventually with enough
practice<00:02:15.450> yours<00:02:15.720> will<00:02:15.930> look<00:02:15.959> like<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
practice yours will look like this and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780 
practice yours will look like this and
when<00:02:21.180> you're<00:02:21.360> really<00:02:21.720> good<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.769> go<00:02:23.070> like
