00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530

actually just gonna be using lemon to
put<00:05:15.800> over<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.340> top<00:05:16.370> so<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.389> just<00:05:17.600> the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
put over the top so this is just the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.140 
put over the top so this is just the
lemon<00:05:17.900> that<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.380> used<00:05:18.620> earlier<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.760> can<00:05:19.940> just

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
lemon that I used earlier you can just

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.480

put the lemon pieces on top and I think

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.240 
put the lemon pieces on top and I think
it<00:05:22.760> just<00:05:22.789> makes<00:05:23.210> everything<00:05:23.690> look<00:05:24.260> prettier

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
this make a huge difference because for

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.110

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
it's a visual experience too and why not

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.480 
it's a visual experience too and why not
just<00:05:38.419> take<00:05:38.840> a<00:05:38.900> little<00:05:39.289> extra<00:05:39.500> time<00:05:39.740> just<00:05:40.370> to
