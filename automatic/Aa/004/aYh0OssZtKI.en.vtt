joints<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.279> kind<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> stiff<00:00:31.040> it<00:00:32.040> feels<00:00:32.759> like

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
joints are kind of stiff it feels like

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.780 
joints are kind of stiff it feels like
there's<00:00:33.120> double<00:00:33.719> knee<00:00:33.870> joints<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.530> get

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
there's double knee joints and I can get

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.290 
there's double knee joints and I can get
this<00:00:35.790> bottom<00:00:36.210> part<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> bend<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.590> uh<00:00:38.300> has

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this bottom part to bend back but uh has

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
this bottom part to bend back but uh has
a<00:00:39.329> lot<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:40.170> bitter<00:00:40.379> resistance<00:00:40.530> trying

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a lot of little bitter resistance trying

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
a lot of little bitter resistance trying
to<00:00:41.070> come<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.670> position<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.360> can't

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to come back into position and I can't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560 
to come back into position and I can't
get<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> other<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.410> bend<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:44.570> also

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
get this other one to bend as much also

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.470 
get this other one to bend as much also
in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> hip<00:00:45.899> area<00:00:46.079> based<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.480> design

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
in the hip area based on just the design

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930 
in the hip area based on just the design
of<00:00:48.629> his<00:00:48.719> figure<00:00:48.950> his<00:00:49.950> legs<00:00:50.219> hinge<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.640> little

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of his figure his legs hinge a little

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
of his figure his legs hinge a little
bit<00:00:51.030> lower<00:00:51.329> than<00:00:51.570> I'd<00:00:51.690> expect<00:00:52.170> based<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.530> where

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
bit lower than I'd expect based on where

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
bit lower than I'd expect based on where
I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.070> his<00:00:53.250> hips<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.789> his<00:00:53.879> legs<00:00:54.210> should

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I think his hips and his legs should

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.740 
I think his hips and his legs should
pivot<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:56.180> figure<00:00:57.180> looks<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.510> weird

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
pivot at and figure looks a little weird

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090 
pivot at and figure looks a little weird
if<00:00:57.840> his<00:00:57.960> legs<00:00:58.170> aren't<00:00:58.440> totally<00:00:58.710> close

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
if his legs aren't totally close

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.439 
if his legs aren't totally close
together<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.870> just<00:01:00.870> looks<00:01:01.739> slightly<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
together it just looks slightly off the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
together it just looks slightly off the
way<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.719> thighs<00:01:03.930> protrude<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.650> spread

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
way his thighs protrude if you spread

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
way his thighs protrude if you spread
his<00:01:04.979> legs<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.519> apart<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> really

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
his legs a little bit apart but I really

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.130 
his legs a little bit apart but I really
am<00:01:06.990> liking<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:08.630> double<00:01:09.630> jointed<00:01:09.930> elbows

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
am liking the double jointed elbows

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
am liking the double jointed elbows
quite<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.790> mid<00:01:12.540> torso<00:01:12.780> cut<00:01:13.490> works

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
quite a bit and the mid torso cut works

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
quite a bit and the mid torso cut works
pretty<00:01:14.700> well<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.799> also<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> fact<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
pretty well I also like the fact that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.120 
pretty well I also like the fact that
the<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.330> head<00:01:18.630> has<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:21.590> hinge<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> bottom

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the the head has a a hinge at the bottom

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.780 
the the head has a a hinge at the bottom
of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> neck<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.299> ball<00:01:24.990> joint<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> top

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
of the neck and a ball joint at the top

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.469 
of the neck and a ball joint at the top
which<00:01:26.810> creates<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:27.960> creepy<00:01:28.380> little

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
which creates some creepy little

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.249 
which creates some creepy little
positions<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
positions that you can do which is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.160 
positions that you can do which is
rather<00:01:32.070> appropriate<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.729> figure

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
rather appropriate for this figure

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.300 
rather appropriate for this figure
here's<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> few<00:01:34.409> nitpicks<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> figure

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
here's a few nitpicks about the figure

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.410 
here's a few nitpicks about the figure
you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.090> came<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you know this one when it came out of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
you know this one when it came out of
the<00:01:36.479> packaging<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> collar<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.590> flipped<00:01:37.950> up

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the packaging the collar was flipped up

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880 
the packaging the collar was flipped up
so<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:39.090> constant<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> tie<00:01:40.200> over<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so I'm constant to put the tie over the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.319 
so I'm constant to put the tie over the
collar<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> Kollek<00:01:41.640> u<00:01:41.759> s--<00:01:41.790> popping<00:01:42.210> up

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
collar and the Kollek u s-- popping up

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.109 
collar and the Kollek u s-- popping up
now<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.960> lapels<00:01:43.439> are<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> little<00:01:44.850> sloppy

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
now the lapels are also a little sloppy

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
now the lapels are also a little sloppy

outfit<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:57.419> I<00:05:57.450> do<00:05:57.539> like<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.050> details<00:05:58.380> on<00:05:58.500> this

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
outfit but I do like the details on this

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.080 
outfit but I do like the details on this
coat<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.039> like<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.310> way<00:05:59.400> these<00:05:59.610> buttons<00:06:00.000> are

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
coat I like the way these buttons are

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.400 
coat I like the way these buttons are
sewn<00:06:00.300> on<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.510> think<00:06:00.690> they<00:06:00.870> look<00:06:01.020> better<00:06:01.229> than

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
sewn on I think they look better than

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.560 
sewn on I think they look better than
the<00:06:01.500> buttons<00:06:01.770> on<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.100> figure<00:06:02.970> shirt<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:03.539> vest

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the buttons on the figure shirt and vest

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.719 
the buttons on the figure shirt and vest
and<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.110> like<00:06:04.320> that<00:06:04.470> they<00:06:04.560> use<00:06:04.770> little<00:06:05.490> metal

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
and I like that they use little metal

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.370 
and I like that they use little metal
buckles<00:06:06.150> on<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.900> coat

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
buckles on the coat

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.370 
buckles on the coat
now<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.919> outfit<00:06:08.520> on<00:06:08.550> this<00:06:08.760> figure<00:06:09.120> is<00:06:09.380> decent

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
now the outfit on this figure is decent

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.710 
now the outfit on this figure is decent
it's<00:06:10.770> not<00:06:10.889> awesome<00:06:11.100> but<00:06:11.880> it's<00:06:12.000> not<00:06:12.120> awful<00:06:12.539> I

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
it's not awesome but it's not awful I

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.540
