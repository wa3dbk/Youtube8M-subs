major<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> throwback<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:58.170> an

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
major I think it was a throwback to an

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
major I think it was a throwback to an
era<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> teacher<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.860> revered<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.610> he

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
era when a teacher was revered and he

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.470 
era when a teacher was revered and he
did<00:02:04.140> deserve<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.680> believe<00:02:04.920> there

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
did deserve to believe there

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.880 
did deserve to believe there
he<00:02:07.480> probably<00:02:07.750> would<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.140> preferred<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.710> be

he probably would have preferred to be

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.030 
he probably would have preferred to be
in<00:02:09.250> friendlier<00:02:09.880> terms<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:10.570> he<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.830> great

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
in friendlier terms but he was the great
