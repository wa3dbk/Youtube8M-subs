tune it what I have here is a lie grand
combat<00:00:26.420> tuner<00:00:27.420> tool<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.050> don't<00:00:28.170> need<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
combat tuner tool you don't need the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.919 
combat tuner tool you don't need the
tool<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> good<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.810> can

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
tool but this is good because you can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.410 
tool but this is good because you can
set<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.130> wait<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.759> few<00:00:33.059> minutes

with<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> jig<00:00:34.430> for<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.850> take

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
with it in the jig for it to really take

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
with it in the jig for it to really take
the<00:00:36.239> bend<00:00:36.480> otherwise<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.860> trying<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the bend otherwise if you're trying to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580 
the bend otherwise if you're trying to
bend<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> by<00:00:38.579> hand<00:00:38.989> it's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.140> inaccurate

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
bend it by hand it's a little inaccurate

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.910 
bend it by hand it's a little inaccurate
that<00:00:40.950> way<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> take

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that way you know it's going to take

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
that way you know it's going to take
more<00:00:44.070> trial<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> error<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> wanted<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.780> more

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
more trial and error I wanted to be more

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
more trial and error I wanted to be more
accurate<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.039> extractor<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
accurate so I have my extractor in the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420 
accurate so I have my extractor in the
jig<00:00:48.320> when<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> came<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> factory<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
jig when it came from the factory was a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
jig when it came from the factory was a
piece<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.789> crap<00:00:51.649> failed<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.120> extract<00:00:54.260> double

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
piece of crap failed to extract double

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.760 
piece of crap failed to extract double
feed<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> jamming<00:00:57.000> right<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.480> lap

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
feed that was just jamming right in lap

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.910 
feed that was just jamming right in lap
and<00:00:58.969> inspecting<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> injector<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> saw<00:01:01.079> why<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and inspecting the injector I saw why it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.050 
and inspecting the injector I saw why it
was<00:01:02.309> way<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> tune<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> basically<00:01:05.820> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
was way out of tune so basically it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
was way out of tune so basically it's
just<00:01:06.210> sitting<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> jig<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.920> tighten

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
just sitting in the jig and you tighten

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.510 
just sitting in the jig and you tighten
the<00:01:08.430> tension<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> big<00:01:09.990> red<00:01:10.200> knob<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.830> up

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the tension with the big red knob and up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.320 
the tension with the big red knob and up
here<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.210> adjust<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.760> distance<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
here you adjust the distance you want to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
here you adjust the distance you want to
bend<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.650> just<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.740> slow<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> directions<00:01:17.729> are

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
bend it just go slow the directions are

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.249 
bend it just go slow the directions are
good<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.270> wanted<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> show<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
good I just wanted to show you what the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
good I just wanted to show you what the
jig<00:01:19.470> looked<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.479> 30

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
jig looked like I think it was like 30

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.249 
jig looked like I think it was like 30
bucks<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.350> something<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:23.310> too<00:01:23.520> bad<00:01:23.810> after<00:01:24.810> I'm

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
bucks or something not too bad after I'm

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
bucks or something not too bad after I'm
done<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.880> we're<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
done with that we're going to use this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.910 
done with that we're going to use this
thing<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.549> is<00:01:29.549> rated<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.030> forty<00:01:30.329> five<00:01:30.920> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
thing here is rated for forty five and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.700 
thing here is rated for forty five and
ten<00:01:32.100> millimeter<00:01:33.200> together<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.500> came

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
ten millimeter together when they came

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.920 
ten millimeter together when they came
with<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:36.530> 38<00:01:38.570> super<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> why

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
with what does it have 38 super is why

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
with what does it have 38 super is why
I'm<00:01:39.990> guessing<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.729> nine<00:01:41.729> millimeter<00:01:43.009> I'll<00:01:44.009> be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I'm guessing and nine millimeter I'll be

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580 
I'm guessing and nine millimeter I'll be
using<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> 45<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.899> done<00:01:46.140> taking

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
using the 45 so when this is done taking

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
using the 45 so when this is done taking
the<00:01:46.680> band<00:01:46.890> I'll<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> instructor<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the band I'll put the instructor back in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
the band I'll put the instructor back in
and<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.950> I'll<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.869> take<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> tools<00:01:52.790> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and what I'll do is take the tools it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
and what I'll do is take the tools it's
hard<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.180> without<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.540> cameraman<00:01:54.950> 10<00:01:55.950> my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
hard to do without a cameraman 10 my

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.899 
hard to do without a cameraman 10 my
knees<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.490> advice<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.159> take<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
knees are advice and you take this and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.249 
knees are advice and you take this and
you<00:01:59.969> basically<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.479> put<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.930> against<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you basically just put it against the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.999 
you basically just put it against the
breach<00:02:01.530> face<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.290> through

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
breach face which is up here and through

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.410 
breach face which is up here and through
the<00:02:05.159> opposite<00:02:05.790> hole<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> put<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:08.099> your

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
the opposite hole you put in your

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
the opposite hole you put in your
trigger<00:02:09.420> gauge<00:02:09.690> okay

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
trigger gauge okay

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.150 
trigger gauge okay
who<00:02:11.670> wants<00:02:12.630> two<00:02:12.720> snaps<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.620> pull<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> out

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
who wants two snaps in you pull it out

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.440 
who wants two snaps in you pull it out
and<00:02:14.900> when<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.020> between<00:02:16.440> 25<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.190> 28<00:02:17.880> ounces

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and when it's between 25 and 28 ounces

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.800 
and when it's between 25 and 28 ounces
or<00:02:19.020> whenever<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.470> prefer<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.600> what's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
or whenever you prefer you know what's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.220 
or whenever you prefer you know what's
that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.760 
that
so<00:02:22.680> most<00:02:23.670> extractors<00:02:24.330> will<00:02:24.660> need<00:02:24.930> some<00:02:25.320> tuning

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
so most extractors will need some tuning

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.730 
so most extractors will need some tuning
at<00:02:25.890> some<00:02:26.130> point<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:27.390> yours<00:02:27.690> breaks<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
at some point if yours breaks and you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
at some point if yours breaks and you
want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> replace<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.790> new<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
want to replace it with a new one the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
want to replace it with a new one the
chances<00:02:30.810> are<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.990> won't<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.380> tuned<00:02:32.330> exactly

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
chances are I won't be tuned exactly

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.500 
chances are I won't be tuned exactly
right<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.610> buy<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.880> piece<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.330> crap

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
right so if you do buy a piece of crap

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.370 
right so if you do buy a piece of crap
Taurus<00:02:36.960> like<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.410> did<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.960> know<00:02:39.990> you're<00:02:40.230> going

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
Taurus like I did you know you're going

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.690 
Taurus like I did you know you're going
to<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.740> how<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.980> do<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.280> because

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
to have to know how to do that because

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.770 
to have to know how to do that because
you're<00:02:41.850> not<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.570> able<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
you're not just going to be able to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
you're not just going to be able to
shoot<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.650> brand<00:02:43.920> new<00:02:44.070> gun<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.270> would

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
shoot a brand new gun like you would

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.170 
shoot a brand new gun like you would
expect<00:02:45.870> because<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:47.520> know<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.670> could<00:02:47.880> send<00:02:48.090> it

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
expect because you know I could send it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.570 
expect because you know I could send it
back<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.330> Taurus<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:50.100> know<00:02:50.190> these<00:02:50.340> pot

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
back to Taurus but you know these pot

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.060 
back to Taurus but you know these pot
little<00:02:50.880> parts<00:02:51.180> would<00:02:51.330> probably<00:02:51.920> be<00:02:52.920> out<00:02:53.040> of

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
little parts would probably be out of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.850 
little parts would probably be out of
tune<00:02:53.540> eventually<00:02:54.540> anyway<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.709> going<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
tune eventually anyway so I'm going to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.650 
tune eventually anyway so I'm going to
try<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> fix<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.490> stock<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> doesn't<00:02:57.540> work

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
try to fix the stock one it doesn't work

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.280 
try to fix the stock one it doesn't work
am<00:02:57.900> i<00:02:58.020> get<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> wilson<00:02:58.590> combat<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.840> tune<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.020> and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
am i get a wilson combat and tune it and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.720 
am i get a wilson combat and tune it and
hopefully<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.070> thing<00:03:02.100> will<00:03:02.370> work<00:03:02.400> good

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
hopefully this thing will work good

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.000 
hopefully this thing will work good
feeds<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.810> well<00:03:04.020> that's<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
feeds really well that's just the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.430 
feeds really well that's just the
extraction<00:03:05.670> that's<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.910> problem<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.600> I'll<00:03:07.350> let

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
extraction that's a problem so I'll let

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.070 
extraction that's a problem so I'll let
you<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.680> how<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.920> goes
