 there will be new things if shibutani

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.870
 third place 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.470
 however after the original dance 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.290
 but also 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.040
 yet to come 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.320
 medal draw 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 that is, what about men aunt and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.300
 arbitrary programs and then

 for gold will enter 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 Nikita Andreev Young Kim Alyona Leonova 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 one more step 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.360
 probably all the same 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.460
 will be played 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.280
 meanwhile in mid thailand there is a gap 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.949
 from the closest pursuers and 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949
 five points of honor 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.019
 it is necessary but dangerous leonova will fight with 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:20.730
 vashadze 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.999
 for third place 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.509
 but it is through 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.759
 now hello now 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.760
 in one and a half 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.449
 overseas more accurate 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.989
 male skating for an hour 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.399
 here are 100 duties on selected 21st century 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.149
 In Bulgaria, this is one of the reasons 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.149
 conflict and links takahashi 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.299
 Neighbor leader 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.459
 the tenth is striking plastic 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.369
 two points behind 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.389
 three points behind him 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.469
 and further on 8 points 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.809
 behind 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.069
 on hot days abad another six points 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.499
 lags behind 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.499
 the struggle for gold probably all the same 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.959
 an ode to takahashi power 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.999
 fight for a pedestal 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.439
 between four 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.379
 precedent do not include geneva 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 how do I see 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.349
 an interesting struggle is underway 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.919
 in the Internet 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.979
 athletes 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.159
 news level wrestling 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.669
 rollers 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.609
 it's like a warm-up 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.879
 when athletes 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.479
 performs those who have entered 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.219
 items 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.219
 then the truth can not jump them 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.589
 the program 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.589
 similar 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.679
 now 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.489
 athletes 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.749
 periodically lay out 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.749
 on the internet, but I can watch tea 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.549
 more often 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.549
 these cascade d 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.150
 crazy 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 not performed at competitions 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.270
 but 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
 everyone talks about it everyone knows it 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.819
 and everyone thinks what will happen if 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.090
 figure skating 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.599
 such pieces 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.969
 without preparation, recoilless cues 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.119
 at tournaments and you can't jump 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.370
 is able 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.979
 johnny weir 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.370
 in training 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.599
 you can also have a movie about death 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.599
 competition is another thing 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.779
 impossible figure skating 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.779
 prepare some element 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.159
 to shoot them an unexpected moment 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.159
 surprise everyone with this 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.210
 almost never happens 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.650
 Economic Court 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.060

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.139
 videos 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.569
 hence the probability 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.939
 chile earthquakes 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.599
 caller data 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.599
 Yevgeny Plushenko 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:40.580
 underway 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.689
 not tried 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.900
 internet fight 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.160
