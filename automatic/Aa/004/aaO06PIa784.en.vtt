00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello to you gamers and be the ones 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.650
 welcome to world of gaming we 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.410
 found for success or trophies 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:23.260
 three shots from the trial game 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.360
 fusion then to unlock success he 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.460
 must succeed the three challenges of the track 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.460
 stratosphere by making less than fifteen 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.260
 mistakes then already have to start with the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.699
 first who's hot behind where he 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.059
 find and finish the hidden area 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.340
 blast furnace so for that must 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.960
 you went to a place on 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 the track where there is an electric cable 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 on the ground so you have to roll over to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.540
 activate the portal so here you are 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.610
 roll on this cable the aca activates a 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.899
 portal just below you back 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.750
 you 're doing a backflip for good 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.160
 fall back on the two wheels and there we 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.850
 enters the zone so she is pretty 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.899
 simple to pass you have to take his 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.300
 time because we see that the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.460
 bridges the bridges its drop it 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.570
 do not go too fast eh otherwise you 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.800
 fall in the game where you do 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.729
 grilling with eyelid lasers 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.740
 bounce to land on the platform 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.709
 so then we go on with the challenge 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.910
 laser so this one has to find 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:27.759
 and finish the hidden area of ​​the laser so 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.369
 this this hidden area is a little bit 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.050
 further times one has to succeed in 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.420
 eject the character so on the rent 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.360
 according to it's the simplest you go 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.190
 from here and you eject the character in 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.860
 high of his 30 years you eject him for 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.840
 reach this case the housing picks up 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.360
 and activates a portal just behind the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.069
 replace so you put back on this 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.830
 ramp and you let slip it's 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.000
 not complicated and once in the zone 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.440
 must make a small jump as soon as 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.270
 sees the first two laser spent when 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.770
 we land we push the character on 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.340
 the front of the bike to land on this 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.099
 checkpoint 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.810
 here one leans against a mulberry and 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.550
 Right laser keys to make key 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.410
 everything on the right we accelerate to pass 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.910
 from above and then we just place 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.649
 in the middle of the ramp to pass between 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.970
 both lasers and remains more than 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.510
 flatten the character on the front for 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.890
 reach this check point 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.900
 alas as soon as the bar the first bars 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.370
 mounts you speed up thoroughly you joke 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.990
 the character on the front and you 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.990
 made a retreat could land here 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.780
 so now is the time to do the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.340
 third challenge of the track this is the most 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.030
 complicated especially the last 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.110
 the last the last area of ​​the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.340
 third challenge that is very complicated 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.460
 okay here I admit it's a fault 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 very con I even hesitated to start again 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.730
 but good as I had done without 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.310
 fault on the first two lives 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.570
 I did not do it again and I did well 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.790
 So for this third challenge to be 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.790
 to go outside the station 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 Here bah be a ramp will have 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.280
 eject from this temper 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.220
 so it's this quenching there that I you 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.020
 speak so you retreat a maximum you 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.480
 flatten the character on the front of the 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.710
 motorcycle will speed you up thoroughly and when you 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.270
 get there you make a left 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.340
 right to climb as high as possible 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.620
 and you eject character that has to 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.810
 crashing against this thing I propose that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 then you reappear at 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.650
 check point of backing down you fall 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.720
 in the hole there is the portal and there you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.100
 enter the last zone so the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.220
 first checkpoint is easy to 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.410
 reach 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.020
 the second must succeed in bouncing back to 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.830
 go over the red barrel that 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.150
 expose if you touch so I tried 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.070
 to do it quietly starting from here 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.600
 I did not succeed the best is to do it 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.310
 in a straight line from checkpoint 1 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.750
 you perform a devotion 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510
 land on the first ramp for 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.010
 to pass over barrels has arrived 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.170
 on this checkpoint you go slightly 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.820
 at the rear wheels you press the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.830
 true wall accelerated to go back 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.160
 flip land here and to be able to 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.170
 land on this checkpoint from 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.330
 check in class you press against the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.790
 wall you speed up a bit for not that 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.120
 the bike too far and you arrive 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.730
 on the last hardest checkpoint 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.110
 is there is a little galley wrong me I 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.930
 given a little boost this 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.610
 this one and declare or have started to 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.010
 touch the managed annuity speed up a big 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.410
 blow so that the bike has gone up in 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 the air and I managed with a little bit 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.109
 of luck also to hang the edge I 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.370
 you leave it idle it may be 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.770
 to be help you 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.780
 declare or before retouch the ramp d 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.260
 speed up a big shot the bike starts 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.699
 up and then you have successfully 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.860
 dodge the right barrel end that makes 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.600
 well at home and a shot that you 're 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.889
 landed on this platform that's 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.860
 simple a left right 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.840
 it would be very happy to lose here and 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.470
 that's it and that's it for this success 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.820
 unblocks 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.290
