tropitone<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> island<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.450> simulated<00:01:49.170> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
tropitone on the island is simulated you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880 
tropitone on the island is simulated you
can<00:01:49.560> choose<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:51.600> their<00:01:51.960> individual

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
entertainment offering on the island so

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
entertainment offering on the island so
maybe<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.450> should<00:02:04.070> try<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.310> something

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
maybe we should try to do something

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:17.449 
maybe we should try to do something
about<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:09.920> let's<00:02:10.970> hop<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:14.310> road<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
about that let's hop to the road so the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.510 
about that let's hop to the road so the
overall<00:02:17.580> goal<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:19.230> keep<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.620> power<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.280> long

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
