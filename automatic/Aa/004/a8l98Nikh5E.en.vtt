00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.699
 in addition to that in your women's magazines and to others these women who travels 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.870
 with csc actually these ski pole fighters will still have a 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.980
 little bit bigger then bitten why it's first take a double risk I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.089
 ends in the 70s this Nordic walking 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.019
 and blanket obviously she closes the march with the sica to walk 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.880
 classic in action because with his feet 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.340
 and yet moved earlier and the lower part of the body with the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 Nordic walking he had violently a stick in every hand nintendo he 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.950
 works his entry 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.930
 the steps 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.400
 there the upper part of the body notch is not to do everything accent 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.120
 somehow a swinging arm movement to propel the body 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.520
 forward so we go a little faster 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.310
 16 pc reads what we do work 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.440
 for 80 to 90 for that sense and body muscles so it's a sport 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.040
 very complete which is a sport 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.640
 because today sports complexion to supervise by the French federation 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.860
 athletics 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.530
 and so it's this physical activity she was doing work together the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.440
 body well the health benefits theme a particular country 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.650
 since we are talking about this month of october pink torres she she ended like 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.440
 others physical activity but but specifically this walk 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.020
 Nordic 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
 it prevents a bed the risks certain risks 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.540
 and appearance of breast cancer so all its health benefits 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 explain by the doctors of the French athletics federation 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 4 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.090
 stuck between the hammer it unfolds like any activity by an epoch 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.940
 warm up 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.050
 a little bit 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.240
 speed and then we take back world in the intensity of practice with in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.640
 particular sometimes during the session exercises that are going to be created at 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.130
 using early debates to also reinvigorate cloud denmark by dictating 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 the elysée 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 the 84 2% of the said 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.130
 it's one of the few sports with rowing 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.010
 after giving back the smile 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.530
 muscular participation 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.920
 so with us 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.189
 for the health that is going to be 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.189
 more important than the traditional market 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.949
 compared to the traditional walk 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:24.149
 to generate a calorie expenditure that goes from 40 to 50% higher 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.199
 allow weight loss 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.499
 as a result the equivalent of the girlfriend angevinière 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.859
 on the other hand we have the feeling of fatigue will be much cheaper will be 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.859
 equivalent to walking 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.969
 so scientific studies have shown that physical activity in 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.499
 particular Nordic walking one can have a beneficial effect on health 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.530
 on cardiovascular disease on diabetes also expected on the 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.969
 prevention of certain types of cancer good job defending the lead in 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.339
 particular 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.769
 cancer and breast cancer prostate cancer is cancer 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.879
 tembo meters 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.260
 these are cancers that will be activated by too much clod secretion 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.620
 of sex hormones and therefore through physical activity to allow a 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.029
 better regulation 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.499
 of hormonal secretion and have benefited 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.879
 in terms of prevention 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 this type of cancer 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.659
 I've been doing Nordic walking for about ten years 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.349
 the aprilia then of my stay at the time when germany the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.509
 particularity and that social security reimburses 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.239
 twice a year for every 100 students who bring in the capital in 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.999
 the whole session in ranges 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.340
 I think French social security could do the same thing 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.669
 in France last year m in the last years 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.579
 you will benefit from the ars 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.370
 it's stronger than that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.620
 neither plant them before runner 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.430
 finally save the state had prepared well its intervention remains the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.860
 even give money 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.320
 she is exactly what she evokes life so women's committees for 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.360
 cancer screening organizes a great Nordic March 9th in 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.810
 the gardens of a room in paris 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.750
 on other dates also in France where we can on different websites 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.259
 we had surfaced 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:12.329
 the sinuous claudine france signs of France have all the information from comics 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.409
 and if he also does not organize another operation in October 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.650
 and what is called the pub for breast cancer screening if the comic 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.240
 is a site where he buys your baguette in October well 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360
 17000 bakery boubou you 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.710
 the year 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.250
 m with his little bags in which we encourage women over 50 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.509
 screening we give them several that's what these little pouches in 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.110
 paper 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.110
 laminated the information to get tested 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.070
 so this is a seminar committee on career cancer screening and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.380
 simple
