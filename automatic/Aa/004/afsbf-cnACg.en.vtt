00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.511
Hi! In today's video I want to teach 
 you how to make your own stickers.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.952
In an easy, simple and quick way.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.147
And well, let's get started!

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.556
In first place the material that you need will be:

00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:18.794
Adhesive paper, you can find this paper in stationary 
 as you can see in the back, 

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.599
it has a layer that we can remove to stick the sticker.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.629
Also we're going to need a pencil.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:27.987
An eraser.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:30.057
Markers.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:34.514
If it's better if you can use permanent markers 
 but if you can't there's no problem.

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:39.079
We'll need scissors as well.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.115
And the last thing that we'll need is contact paper.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.474
It's the one that we use to cover or line 
 books that you can also find on stationary stores.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.919
If not you can also use tape.

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:56.648
And well now I'm going to explain how to do it!

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.011
The first thing that we're going to make is create a design.

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:04.050
I already made some.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.990
We will make this on the white adhesive paper.

00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:35.619
When we have our design we will ink the outline.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.787
And then we will erase the pencil to color it after that.

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:33.270
And here you can see a really quick 
 example of some doodles that I made.

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:39.080
And when the marker's ink dries out we will erase the pencil.

00:02:39.823 --> 00:02:51.840
Don't hurry and try to erase it too quick because if you do it when you just finished 
 it probably you'll mess up the paper with the ink and we don't want that to happen.

00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:03.470
Once we erase all the pencil remains we'll proceed to color it.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:46.950
Once we have our drawings colored we're going 
 to cover them with our contact paper.

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:49.790
This is going to help the drawing from not fade.

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:56.790
If we use permanent markers there won't be as 
 much "danger" for the drawing from fading.

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:04.660
And if you don't have contact paper you 
 can use tape, it will work too.

00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:11.630
Try not to left any air bubbles when you're covering it.

00:04:12.112 --> 00:04:15.740
And once covered with the contact paper, now 
 we are going to cut them. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.130
And when we finish cutting them now we can stick them wherever we want!

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:34.040
The only thing that we have to do is 
 take off the layer of the back.

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.770
And stick it wherever you want it!

00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:48.110
And that's it!

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:54.240
Also there's another option, you can print the stickers.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:05:02.990
The only thing you have to do is put the adhesive paper on the 
 printer and print them normally as you would do with any other paper.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:07.490
And after that cover them with contact paper to 
 prevent them from fade and that's all.

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:12.730
As you can see here are some examples of the ones that I printed.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.720
And the ones that I just made on this tutorial.

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:22.520
I hope this was helpful and if you have any 
 question please comment down below and I'll gladly answer.
