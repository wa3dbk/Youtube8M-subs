00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.260 
old and I mean for his age as the actual
actor<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.820> tonight<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.570> very<00:02:03.860> playful<00:02:04.860> um

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
actor but tonight it was very playful um

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.770 
actor but tonight it was very playful um
it<00:02:06.270> felt<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> Marvel<00:02:07.860> movie<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:09.270> Marvel

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it felt like a Marvel movie a Marvel

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.670 
it felt like a Marvel movie a Marvel
experience<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.430> was<00:02:11.459> only<00:02:11.760> an<00:02:11.910> hour<00:02:12.060> long

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
experience and it was only an hour long
