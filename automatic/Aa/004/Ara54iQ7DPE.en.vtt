00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
race this in run well but you don't want
to<00:00:36.930> necessarily<00:00:37.050> paper<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to necessarily paper because the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
to necessarily paper because the
Europeans<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.390> until<00:00:39.629> obviously<00:00:39.930> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
Europeans are not until obviously this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
Europeans are not until obviously this
week<00:00:40.260> next<00:00:40.500> week<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.610> steadfast<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
week next week so I'm steadfast the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940 
week next week so I'm steadfast the
season<00:00:42.719> we're<00:00:42.840> gradually<00:00:43.079> peaking<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.739> think

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
season we're gradually peaking I think

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.910 
season we're gradually peaking I think
and<00:00:44.250> towards<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> Europeans<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.329> Barcelona

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and towards the Europeans in Barcelona

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
and towards the Europeans in Barcelona
tool<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.520> possible<00:00:47.809> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
tool because it's not possible and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
tool because it's not possible and
possibly<00:00:49.260> yeah<00:00:49.440> absolutely<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.520> maybe<00:00:50.700> I'll

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
possibly yeah absolutely but maybe I'll

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.920 
possibly yeah absolutely but maybe I'll
save<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> Europeans<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
save them for the Europeans and the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.060 
save them for the Europeans and the
Commonwealth's<00:00:52.379> rather<00:00:52.649> than<00:00:52.829> their

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
Commonwealth's rather than their

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
Commonwealth's rather than their
early-season<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.620> sometimes<00:00:55.620> never<00:00:55.829> seen

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
early-season and sometimes never seen

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
early-season and sometimes never seen
them<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> long<00:00:57.449> season<00:00:57.750> for

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
them then it will be a long season for

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779
