00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello young call if he to classes 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 quilted stitching I'm going now 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 explain how to ride a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 invisible zipper so I'm going 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 show you on a sample a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.529
 small study room 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.300
 so we're going to pretend it's a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.150
 side skirts 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.330
 I prepared the sewing here on throw 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.650
 and pass a casting wire to see where is 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 be zipped 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 she shows up with a small slider 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.510
 rounded like that momentum towards closure 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 Flash is not on that side 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 closing lights a visit that's it at 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.610
 final it'll be like that it helps well 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.690
 to know how to go about 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.719
 start we will catch so the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 zipper with the seam I open 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.090
 the geminated zipper bread because 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 that I had decided that this would be the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.460
 length but I'm going to open it up 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 down here I am going to have to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 stop here because otherwise I would be 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 embarrassed to sting to the end with the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 dancer foot a special foot for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 zipper ensures everything and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.420
 especially of machines I'll pinned in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.420
 this meaning is important 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 and most importantly I'll be careful of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.680
 to match the point that I have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 decided with a point that I measured 2 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 mm more than on the zipper 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 that is to say I put right away 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 art is here what makes the fabric 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 underneath it's going to be bigger a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.310
 little bit bigger than the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.079
 zipper 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.750
 this is to prevent that once mounted to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.180
 zipper she gondolas I tell myself 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 not that all along 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 the little waves of the fabric and it's going 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.530
 very well come back later 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.880
 here I am going to steal from one end to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.880
 the other by stopping here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.200
 then back up to start a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.629
 misstep stitched on the claws in 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.550
 I really need plastic stung account 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.260
 remove the pins I could have built 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.430
 also it's faster with iron with the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.099
 spine but will need a little bit 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.160
 experience so you can very well 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.190
 pin and build but not delete 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.400
 the step of pinned marc is unparalleled 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 that I had decided to go back 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.079
 here's a side now i'm going to do 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.940
 the other side on the same principle 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.900
 so we can already close the first 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.319
 side that is sewn the second he goes 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.880
 to be like that so I do like everything at 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.410
 the time I caught inside and I 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.630
 have to open the zipper 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.000
 otherwise I can not go far 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.299
 that's it but when I'm going to sting I'm going 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.049
 start from the bottom a pin at the top 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.889
 a pin down their father there is the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.389
 little trait with their father from below I 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.620
 be the same height so I have the 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.799
 little waves underneath like everything at 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.530
 the time we see the fabric is no longer 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:27.900
 long so much better 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:32.389
 I'm sharing once twice and I'm going 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 sting starting from the bottom 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:41.180
 so by spreading the little ledge 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.180
 plastic 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.160
 I always pass the wire underneath 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.680
 that's the same thing as before 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.450
 then the third step 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.650
 we will see by closing again the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.829
 zipper that starts to be 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.799
 well invisible it remains more than 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.830
 finish the bottom part there I had 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.050
 left the provisional stitching without doing 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.220
 of breakpoints and now I'm going 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.919
 sew from so this stop 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.740
 provisional until the end of the 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.710
 zipper it's yesterday so far 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.930
 so I resume on the old bites 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.930
 and I will finish here 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.350
 he sees there the invisible zipper 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.170
 there is nothing left but to remove the wires from 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.100
 build 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:05:01.200
 here it is it is closed it is not seen 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.180
 not so this zipper is 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.760
 much easier to assemble than this 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.620
 we imagine it's even easier than 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.540
 the others since the seams are 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.630
 found inside and not in 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.040
 outside so even if a tiny 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.470
 away it's not seen too much these two 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.540
 zippers this fits very well 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.670
 for the dresses the skirts but even the 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.200
 pants it's invisible it's enough 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.500
 easy to do finally unlike 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.090
 other fixtures that have seams 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.040
 apparent that must be right 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.710
 this is a small gap is not seen too much 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.280
 that was maybe quite 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.280
 accessible
