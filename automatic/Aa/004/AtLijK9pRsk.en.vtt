Spencer Macintosh know when to come on

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.810 
Spencer Macintosh know when to come on
and<00:00:04.500> talk<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.879> the<00:00:05.879> solution<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.820> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
and talk about the solution to the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.749 
and talk about the solution to the
recent<00:00:09.120> problem<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:11.790> controller<00:00:12.679> being

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
recent problem with the controller being

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.880 
recent problem with the controller being
not<00:00:14.759> responding<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.900> console<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
not responding to your console on the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.260 
not responding to your console on the
ps4<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.779> stuff<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.029> one

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
ps4 and stuff like that and so this one

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.439 
ps4 and stuff like that and so this one
isn't<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.080> solution<00:00:22.699> not<00:00:23.699> necessarily<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
isn't the solution not necessarily the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.330 
isn't the solution not necessarily the
solution<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.170> problems<00:00:25.410> not

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
solution to all your problems not

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
solution to all your problems not
necessarily<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.000> solution<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.859> every

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
necessarily the solution to every

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.389 
necessarily the solution to every
problem<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.470> solution<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.219> my

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
problem this was the solution of my

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.900 
problem this was the solution of my
problem<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.390> let<00:00:33.600> me<00:00:33.630> tell<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.079> um<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
problem so let me tell you um so the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
problem so let me tell you um so the
problem<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.600> controller<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.440> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
problem of my controller that I have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.150 
problem of my controller that I have
four<00:00:37.829> hits<00:00:37.980> did<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.700> defective<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.160> problem

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
four hits did the defective one problem

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
four hits did the defective one problem
with<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.489> controller<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> would

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
with my controller is that when I would

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.639 
with my controller is that when I would
plug<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.750> pulse<00:00:45.750> orange<00:00:46.320> shield

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
plug it in it would pulse orange shield

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
plug it in it would pulse orange shield
like<00:00:46.890> Faden<00:00:47.370> orange<00:00:47.820> Amanda<00:00:48.210> would<00:00:48.329> fade<00:00:48.539> away

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
like Faden orange Amanda would fade away

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.069 
like Faden orange Amanda would fade away
and<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:50.520> nothing<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:51.030> happen<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.660> wouldn't

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and that nothing would happen I wouldn't

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
and that nothing would happen I wouldn't
be<00:00:52.140> able<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> hit<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> PS<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.280> nothing<00:00:53.670> would

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
be able to hit the PS but nothing would

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.819 
be able to hit the PS but nothing would
happen<00:00:53.969> um<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.690> around<00:00:57.960> wasn't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
happen um it was just all around wasn't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.709 
happen um it was just all around wasn't
responding<00:00:59.399> i<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:00:59.879> turning<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.300> wasn't

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
responding i wasn't turning on wasn't

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
responding i wasn't turning on wasn't
charging<00:01:01.020> anymore<00:01:01.980> um<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.409> around

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
charging anymore um and it all around

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.090 
charging anymore um and it all around
just<00:01:04.979> wasn't<00:01:05.309> working<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.710> pretty<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just wasn't working so pretty much the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.880 
just wasn't working so pretty much the
prime<00:01:08.400> solution<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.619> next

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
prime solution that I did is the next

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.359 
prime solution that I did is the next
day<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> went<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.760> bought<00:01:11.970> another<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.540> um

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
day I went out and bought another one um

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.390 
day I went out and bought another one um
I<00:01:14.369> went<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.180> bought<00:01:15.390> another<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.400> loaded

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I went out and bought another one loaded

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.980 
I went out and bought another one loaded
the<00:01:17.490> ps4<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:18.270> had<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> setup<00:01:19.290> screen<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the ps4 up had the setup screen on and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
the ps4 up had the setup screen on and
press<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> ps4<00:01:22.500> button<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.299> PS<00:01:24.600> button

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
press the ps4 button and the PS button

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
press the ps4 button and the PS button
and<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.770> worked<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.100> fine<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:29.189> seems

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and it worked just fine and that seems

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
and it worked just fine and that seems
to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.619> solution<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:33.240> probably<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to be the solution it's probably not the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
to be the solution it's probably not the
best<00:01:33.960> solution<00:01:34.380> eventually<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.670> they'll

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
best solution eventually here they'll

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
best solution eventually here they'll
probably<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.479> people<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.200> smarter<00:01:37.320> than

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
probably be people that are smarter than

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.780 
probably be people that are smarter than
me<00:01:37.950> who<00:01:38.670> come<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.100> solution

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
me who come up with a you know solution

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.749 
me who come up with a you know solution
how<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> without<00:01:42.479> wasting<00:01:43.369> money<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
how to do it without wasting money and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.010 
how to do it without wasting money and
everything<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.860> uh<00:01:48.020> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
everything like that what I was uh what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.420 
everything like that what I was uh what
what<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.649> I'm<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> would<00:01:51.619> say<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
what what I'm what I would say is a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.039 
what what I'm what I would say is a
little<00:01:53.820> trick<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.390> could<00:01:54.600> use<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.020> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
little trick you could use it if you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.219 
little trick you could use it if you
want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> i'm<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.710> telling<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.939> um

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
want to i'm not telling you to use it um

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.069 
want to i'm not telling you to use it um
i<00:01:58.229> didn't<00:01:58.710> use<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.920> yet<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.540> trick<00:02:03.840> i

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
i didn't use it yet but a little trick i

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
i didn't use it yet but a little trick i
had<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.430> were<00:02:05.549> gone<00:02:05.850> by<00:02:06.180> another

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
had was that if you were gone by another

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.309 
had was that if you were gone by another
controller<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.789> ps4<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.599> order<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
controller of the ps4 and in order to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.220 
controller of the ps4 and in order to
make<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.739> money's<00:02:11.099> worth<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.940> your

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.690 
it's fair that you get a little bit of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
compensation so make yourself a

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.000 
compensation so make yourself a
compensation<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:02.629> was<00:04:02.959> my<00:04:02.989> solution<00:04:03.470> to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
compensation so that was my solution to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.789 
compensation so that was my solution to
the<00:04:04.129> problem<00:04:04.780> tell<00:04:05.780> me<00:04:05.959> if<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.200> worked<00:04:06.470> for

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
the problem tell me if that worked for

everybody<00:04:09.440> there's<00:04:09.889> some<00:04:10.129> problems<00:04:10.609> in<00:04:10.790> which

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
everybody there's some problems in which

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.979 
everybody there's some problems in which

the blue light will blink on the console
I<00:04:15.579> don't<00:04:16.579> know<00:04:16.699> how<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.030> fix<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.989> would<00:04:18.320> say

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
I don't know how to fix that I would say

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.969 
I don't know how to fix that I would say
the<00:04:19.310> same<00:04:19.579> thing<00:04:20.030> maybe<00:04:20.390> go<00:04:20.690> out<00:04:20.719> and<00:04:21.260> actually

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
the same thing maybe go out and actually

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.640 
the same thing maybe go out and actually
there<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:23.030> solution<00:04:23.919> they<00:04:24.919> are<00:04:25.340> not

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
there is a solution they are not

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.010 
there is a solution they are not
a<00:04:25.710> possible<00:04:26.669> solution<00:04:26.970> for<00:04:27.509> that<00:04:27.540> let's<00:04:27.870> put

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
a possible solution for that let's put

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.189 
a possible solution for that let's put
it<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.169> way<00:04:28.490> um<00:04:29.490> if<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.720> don't<00:04:30.990> have

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
it that way um if you don't have
