00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.470
 one in shape 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.470
 campaign penguins 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.889
 I watch people episodes what I do 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 do numbers 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 what did i have to keep doing it 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 first thing i said was maybe i 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 ask to put something in front of me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.369
 to scoop out the ping 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 but I actually think this is not possible 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 because it's a pink slip 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 I give you a chance to oppose me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 to win something 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 so I'm not going to do that I'm not going 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 ask you for something opposite 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 line bet 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 so the bet remains free 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.090
 I will change one thing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.059
 you probably have it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.059
 all long china of course is then 10 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 team is perhaps a bit of a bad one 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.450
 word choice but of course I mean 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.960
 there loss company 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 tce gt chemistry if they do that after an hour 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 ride call bpl over power 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.070
 I would of course explain the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 conclusion from before video was from one 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 the swan fascination 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 you put the player or the game does not go 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.430
 everyone needed a collapse oops I had 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.080
 still be right in 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 and two was like your jury against a team 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.100
 also spoke simply or power team 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 i'm supposed to play there so that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.430
 is therefore what I am going to do now 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.500
 let's go okay there we sit and we sit 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.509
 so in pot he stuff the bundesliga 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.430
 team the people then I think 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 since that what bundesliga I stood 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.039
 so play with that bpl team wants to be yes 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 no in conclusion you actually have that name 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.729
 for delivery has come is an i may 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.970
 also just with nice over power team too 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 go play and 2 is not like me 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.009
 appoint 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.660
 oh he also has a bbl team 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.280
 high it al bundes league but it is one 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.200
 picture in your kika 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.970
 so those are the two things i need me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440
 nothing pleasing about that in itself 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.759
 you also have a few more 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.740
 people 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.539
 I'm just going to play nicely, I want 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.849
 none of you keep doing it pink 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.349
 slip as always that you do nothing or up 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.630
 the game moves there to a me what 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.520
 and the other thing is that I am 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.840
 not you have to appoint overpowers 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.490
 teams are just that themselves 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 so let's see what's out of it 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.840
 this competition is coming 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.269
 oh shit he pours almost error 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:32.239
 series can run and play away 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.250

 you no longer need to explain 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.250
 that he is overpowed is also a cliché 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.019
