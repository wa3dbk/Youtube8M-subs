look at those guys the beautiful Syrian

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.750 
look at those guys the beautiful Syrian
generator<00:00:19.500> using<00:00:20.689> dispensers<00:00:21.800> not<00:00:22.800> string<00:00:23.430> as

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
generator using dispensers not string as

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.710 
generator using dispensers not string as
weak<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.720> did<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> last<00:00:25.320> time<00:00:25.680> or<00:00:26.010> Pistons

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
weak as I did the last time or Pistons

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
weak as I did the last time or Pistons
dispensers<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> let's<00:00:29.730> see<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
dispensers so let's see how how this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.020 
dispensers so let's see how how this
stuff<00:00:31.019> works<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:33.710> press<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> rest<00:00:35.430> again<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
stuff works so press it rest again and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
stuff works so press it rest again and
pressed<00:00:36.870> again<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
pressed again and basically the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.639 
pressed again and basically the
dispensers<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> lava<00:00:39.690> bucket<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
dispensers have a lava bucket in it so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.889 
dispensers have a lava bucket in it so
oh<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> basically<00:00:44.450> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
oh so basically this is like the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.229 
oh so basically this is like the
dead<00:00:46.079> spot<00:00:46.379> ok<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.989> turn<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
dead spot ok then you turn it on and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
dead spot ok then you turn it on and
then<00:00:51.239> turns<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:51.930> another<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:53.449> for<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
then turns out another time on for the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.020 
then turns out another time on for the
dispenser<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.289> push<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> back<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.879> lava

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
dispenser to push it back in the lava

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420 
dispenser to push it back in the lava
then<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.230> collect<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
then we can collect it and you know you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
then we can collect it and you know you
need<00:00:59.670> only<00:00:59.879> role<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> addressing<00:01:00.690> that's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
need only role in addressing that's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
need only role in addressing that's
pretty<00:01:01.710> easy<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> find<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pretty easy to find and if you have a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.390 
pretty easy to find and if you have a
fortune<00:01:04.700> pickaxe<00:01:05.720> that's<00:01:06.720> even<00:01:06.990> better<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
fortune pickaxe that's even better to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
fortune pickaxe that's even better to
get<00:01:09.770> now<00:01:11.060> for<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> tutorial<00:01:12.299> let's<00:01:12.900> start

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
get now for the tutorial let's start

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
get now for the tutorial let's start
building<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.100> shall<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:15.710> alrighty<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:18.150> do

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
building it shall we alrighty so what do

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.580 
building it shall we alrighty so what do
we<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.600> our<00:01:22.049> test

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we do now as you can see that's our test

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890 
we do now as you can see that's our test
and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.689> bad

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and I up this one because I'm bad

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.520 
and I up this one because I'm bad
you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you know that's how it's going to be so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.700 
you know that's how it's going to be so
dispensers<00:01:29.750> water<00:01:30.750> buckets<00:01:33.170> right<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.530> by

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
dispensers water buckets right so now by

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.630 
dispensers water buckets right so now by
the<00:01:34.770> stone<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:38.810> lever<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.799> lever<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the stone and lever will need lever and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.160 
the stone and lever will need lever and
that's<00:01:44.640> pretty<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.520> now

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
that's pretty much it for the now so now

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.149 
that's pretty much it for the now so now
you<00:01:49.170> need<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> dig<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.979> block<00:01:51.950> let's<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you need to dig one block let's just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.870 
you need to dig one block let's just
make<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.640> big<00:01:55.340> let's<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.670> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
make it that big let's just make it that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.499 
make it that big let's just make it that
big<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.329> place<00:01:57.719> water<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:59.090> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
big and place water there you can do it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.969 
big and place water there you can do it
on<00:02:00.630> each<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:01.140> doesn't<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:02.130> matter<00:02:02.790> now

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
on each side doesn't really matter now

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.290 
on each side doesn't really matter now
you<00:02:04.979> need<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.700> block<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:07.729> then<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you need to go one block up and then you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.390 
you need to go one block up and then you
need<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.890> Pistons

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
need to put your Pistons

need to put your Pistons
I'll<00:02:13.209> just<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.290> easier

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
I'll just do this because it's easier

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.410 
I'll just do this because it's easier
for<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:15.310> dispensers<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.849> destroy<00:02:19.030> them

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
for the dispensers you can destroy them

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.020 
for the dispensers you can destroy them
orally<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.049> let<00:02:20.319> them<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.519> not<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> big

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
orally it let them there it's not a big

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.009 
orally it let them there it's not a big
of<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.269> problem<00:02:22.599> only<00:02:23.409> aesthetics<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:28.019> you

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
