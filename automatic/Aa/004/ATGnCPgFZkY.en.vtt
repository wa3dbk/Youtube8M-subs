 want i can smartphone screens them 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.620
 resolution grows every year everything 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.090
 more and more and thickness and 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.650
 respectively battery capacity 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.689
 reduced run time without recharging 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.849
 getting smaller and need something with that 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.160
 do yes you can easily use 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.930
 a crib in this review dasha such 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.789
 shows but there are ways about which not 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.160
 everyone knows and I am on garlic to you about them 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.110
 I will lead the first procedure that I 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.590
 always do this disable search 3g 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.570
 nets 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.600
 Naturally, this operation is not suitable for those 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.040
 Who actually uses them ? 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.079
 this item is in the menu 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.210
 namely, in the point of mobile networks here 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.550
 there will be either a pronounced string or somewhere 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.920
 she will be near if you do not have this 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.440
 settings do not despair typing 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.890
 diameter sprocket sprocket sprocket 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 lattice 46 36 lattice flower lattice 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.149
 asterisk and promising me not to touch anything 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.949
 except for the first item and it is the network 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.230
 choose jetsam by default 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.760
 only all increase autonomy you already 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.770
 feel in a day and if not 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.470
 feel it means you have yuji 3 where 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 it's all normal with the battery ok 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.039
 go further about off by 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.410
 unnecessary DPS Wi-Fi and bluetooth 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.759
 I think everyone knows, but the settings are wifi 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.349
 there are additional features 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.899
 so for example you can configure wi-fi 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.849
 sleep mode selecting an item is always it 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.250
 can fall asleep when not using a 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.259
 if you choose there will be no time to work and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 thus, it is also worth eating a charge 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.440
 pay attention to this item 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.300
 who has problems finding wifi or with 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.250
 connection stability of some 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.110
 firmware is the point of wi-fi optimization 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.810
 turn it on and all battery 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.410
 a little further we proceed to configure 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.300
 batteries 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.489
 Some firmware includes built-in 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.530
 the power manager function is here already 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.450
 your discretion but worth knowing if 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.099
 love and from heavy games include 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.289
 full performance otherwise 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:53.250
 long puzzle why on your 80 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.179
 nuclear processor does not go maria 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.190
 further important point in the survey 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.229
 battery gluttony sync 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.520
 need to use it wisely so 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.200
 for example, it is not necessary and 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.450
 turn off completely enough turn off 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.580
 unnecessary so for example in paragraph google and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.280
 I turn on all but dzhimayl and EKIP and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.410
 I do not use any other words 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.380
 about antivirus for many years of work 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 with android me 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.070
 I have never had a virus 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.600
 an influenza virus and me as 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.490
 if I download programs from play 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.500
 market or another trusted site 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.240
 you don't need antivirus but if you often 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.680
 climb unfamiliar places or 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.810
 pathological lucky 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.580
 better to be safe one of the most 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.410
 gluttonous functions in terms of charge 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.690
 battery is a smartphone screen 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.460
 here do what your heart tells me 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.230
 for example, the author is not comfortable to use 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.640
 backlight adjustment as I love 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.350
 so it was brightly nice if someone 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.350
 Michael's couple helped grandfather all that bi ms 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.240
 wish i could
