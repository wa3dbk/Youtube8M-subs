sugar<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> bowl<00:01:14.490> four<00:01:15.060> cups<00:01:15.330> per<00:01:15.570> pound

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
sugar in this bowl four cups per pound

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
sugar in this bowl four cups per pound
pure<00:01:16.920> Kenan<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.790> pure<00:01:18.090> cane<00:01:18.390> sugar<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
pure Kenan this is pure cane sugar and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.859 
pure Kenan this is pure cane sugar and
what<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.939> cup<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> molasses

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
what I have here is one cup of molasses

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
what I have here is one cup of molasses
so<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> math<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.310> means<00:01:23.670> there's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so if you do the math that means there's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.050 
so if you do the math that means there's
two<00:01:24.150> tablespoons<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.020> molasses<00:01:25.680> per<00:01:26.009> cup<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
two tablespoons of molasses per cup so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
two tablespoons of molasses per cup so
there<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.299> 16<00:01:27.810> tablespoons<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.619> molasses

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
there are 16 tablespoons of molasses

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.469 
there are 16 tablespoons of molasses
which<00:01:29.310> equals<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> cup<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.409> there's<00:01:32.479> 16

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
which equals a cup because there's 16

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
which equals a cup because there's 16
tablespoons<00:01:34.320> per<00:01:34.740> cup

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
because there's 4 tablespoons in 1/4 of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.780 
because there's 4 tablespoons in 1/4 of
a<00:01:37.259> cup<00:01:38.240> 1/2<00:01:39.240> cup<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.320> cool<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.610> right
