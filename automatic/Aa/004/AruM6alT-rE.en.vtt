00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.020
 and let's go with the first data of the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.780
 community when trayter foxx and is that 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.039
 I'm not wrong and he tells us that 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:22.800
 if we write gif the username 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.390
 to see if it 's a bird and for example 35 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.430
 64 well this code is to give you 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.850
 objects other people but he says that 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.579
 if we write 95 64 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 will give us 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.910
 and he's going to give us this block which 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.519
 Well, as you can see, it 's a very block 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 weird is rando I do not know I do not know the truth for 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.780
 what it is and it's called a closed box worth 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.180
 the chest closed and if they disappear with the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.879
 time like this is to disappear with time 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.770
 you put one and they disappear and the truth 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.260
 I do not know what use I have 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.740
 let's put this on and let's get 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.140
 in survival cousins ​​of 0 voucher and if what 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.730
 we apply so the block gives us who 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.950
 I would say who would say that he gives us the block and 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.530
 can see that it disappears and well that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.330
 is the first data and we continue and we go with 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.800
 the second data of the community when 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.960
 come in and diego espinoza and the truth 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.910
 thank you very much because they are with 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.140
 the data is commenting on data that the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.180
 truth is that I did not know and I know 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.060
 I thank good we go with this data of 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.420
 diego espinoza which tells us that the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.119
 objects bounce in cauldrons with water like this 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.979
 let's see if it's true there is 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.860
 how can you see the objects that we throw 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.200
 we bounce to throw this bounce for a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.020
 some time or sometimes that both sides 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.369
 they do not move and then they bounce to the pulse 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.560
 is there is the proof that it is thrown 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.150
 an object in a cauldron with water this one 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.730
 bounces 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.500
 sons of bitches who are not happy 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.640
 feel the pair and hart richards for and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.250
 hard for heart bitter and we go with the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.200
 next data which is good 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.820
 Actually , I realized what playing 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 I say there are many people who know it but 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.530
 Well, how can you see them in the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.960
 Mendez appear and that more than we are going 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.870
 to operate at night because that way they are not 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.750
 it escapes good because we put a germ and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.650
 we paste and as you can see disappear 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.250
 So what do you have to do? 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.560
 to put a picture below and we 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.800
 on the internet here you have to give 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.209
 legs in the legs because that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.209
 disappeared from saved possible 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.040
 can not pitbull and we're going to change it to 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 and if it's ready to put in the middle and 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.750
 we are going to give him in the legs as 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.760
 you can see it does not disappear all that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.470
 we are sticking in the legs and if 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.270
 we can one we have to procure 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.760
 hit on the legs but it is more difficult 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.860
 access because if we hit the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.560
 stomach will disappear and good 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.560
 just that if you hit her in the mind 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.880
 in the legs will not be offered and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.400
 we go with the following data and when 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.860
 bring on jumitus cms is that I do not 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.010
 I'm wrong, I already say super weird names in 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.590
 I'm in survival and good if we put 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.370
 web cap that is this type of sand cloth 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.700
 is that we find in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.170
 in the mines well then let's put a 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 block that is affected by the severity 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.239
 as the case of the sand and they are seeing 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.640
 that is gradually falling this by the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.920
 effect of web or cobweb web 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.010
 with whom we can have to go 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.230
 we activate 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.269
 and they see that it is also going down a little 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.549
 little by little 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.870
 well the effect you can see the effect 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.230
 if the effect occurs but we can also 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 put 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.040
 there it is we are going to see what happens that 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.040
 it has also been projected by the gravity 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.109
 and it's going down and it's about and it 's 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.560
 planned to put this point of view point 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.299
 low low low low low low low low and there 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.319
 there is the dragon egg 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:07.430
 that if you put this as web and you put a 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.890
 block that is affected by the severity 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.049
 destroy this one because it will go down 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.890
 slowly and with himself and when he is 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.259
 down will become a block we can 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.079
 with the latest data from the community and 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.270
 well here tonight he's going to talk in 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.840
 English hamburger kentucky fried chicken 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.250
 wind and scouts juniors and walmart and good 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.800
 what he meant is that he's going to 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.259
 show this good bug this is a good 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.340
 curious fact the truth is good 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.729
 we operate a piston that pushes this and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.199
 this and that will go in the lamp we put 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.849
 a block like you just saw is 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.060
 learned and there is no arrest at 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.979
 side there will surely say no trap 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.560
 that there are good remains we are going to remove the 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.220
 blocks and they will see what good is going 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.350
 to turn off 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.310
 let's remove this and there it is 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.260
 to turn off and as you can see 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.580
 last night do not cry you have something that 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.070

 is what he wanted to say then we are 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.890
 here removing these things 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.980
 and as you can see there is no trace 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.990
 of resiston nearby so they can yes is 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.870
