00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.409 
icon size is 80 you can decrease this or

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:40.610 
icon size is 80 you can decrease this or
not<00:07:37.590> you<00:07:38.189> can<00:07:38.340> also<00:07:38.840> delete<00:07:39.840> all<00:07:40.139> these<00:07:40.289> spells

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
not you can also delete all these spells

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.059 
not you can also delete all these spells
I<00:07:40.860> think<00:07:41.250> and<00:07:41.520> then<00:07:42.210> it's<00:07:42.569> all<00:07:42.900> on<00:07:43.229> default<00:07:43.680> but

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:44.069 
I think and then it's all on default but

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.559 
I think and then it's all on default but
I'm<00:07:44.190> not<00:07:44.370> sure<00:07:44.610> about<00:07:44.639> that<00:07:45.060> I<00:07:45.120> didn't

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:45.569 
I'm not sure about that I didn't

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.019 
I'm not sure about that I didn't
conflict<00:07:46.139> the<00:07:46.259> Rose<00:07:46.440> or<00:07:46.710> anything<00:07:47.159> also<00:07:47.699> just

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.029 
conflict the Rose or anything also just

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:50.360 
conflict the Rose or anything also just
convict<00:07:48.389> the<00:07:49.080> default<00:07:49.500> settings<00:07:49.860> and<00:07:49.979> I<00:07:50.129> think

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370 
convict the default settings and I think

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.010 
convict the default settings and I think
I<00:07:50.490> might<00:07:50.699> have<00:07:50.729> conflict<00:07:51.330> the<00:07:51.479> specific

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020
