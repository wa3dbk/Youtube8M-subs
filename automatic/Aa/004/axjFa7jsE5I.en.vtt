00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello and welcome to hardware advice 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.980
 today the january update of the 800 euro 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.780
 computers as processor an intel core 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.310
 The i5 3570k is just about gaming 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 so good again 3770 the 2770 k is only 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.460
 stronger because of the 900 megahertz more 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.820
 otherwise it is only two percent 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:32.550
 difference between the 3077 k and 3570 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 k &amp; k brings this open multiplier 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 means easier overclocking or higher 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 Overclock and the processor consumed 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.719
 a maximum of only 77 wat then a cooler 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.879
 great macho 120 millimeters is the thing 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.980
 Huge compared to other fans 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.129
 that 's really big and not for that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.500
 sometimes so high only 150 millimeters so 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.410
 this is very strong overclocking 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.290
 guaranteed and for 31 euros it is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:11.130
 really very cheap as a mainboard 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.890
 1 asv kz 77 euro per 3 usb 3 s ata three 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 pci express 3.0 ddr3 so loud three 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 7.1 sound card and you can do that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.229
 also use integrated graphics 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.810
 So everything you just to the side so 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.960
 or everything that is needed 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.600
 latest is and thanks to the mz 77 chipset 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.450
 you can also overclock 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 as a working memory night league both 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.030
 Crucifixes sport with ddr3 1600 the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 processor supported 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.610
 until 1600 therefore one can smell the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.439
 1600 and take and see is a good one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.700
 latency as a graphics card a 2gb gigabyte 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.119
 geforce gtx 660 with the wind drove 2 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 the second windscreen is cooler 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.240
 dual fan cooler 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.920
 So just stop the card 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.209
 quiet and cool and for free there is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.849
 still assassin's creed 3 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.560
 The graphics card should be all games grad 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.550
 time actually in highest graphics 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.650
 can represent as firm of the 1000 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.930
 gigabyte samsung spinpoint f3 with 32 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.519
 megabyte cache many say yes I should 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 the seagate barracuda next to the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:37.910
 cheaper but the 1000 gigabytes 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.110
 spinpoint f3 is very fast after 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.640
 my experience you have at times 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.220
 Dude was installed and managed and was 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.110
 impressed and besides it is still 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.530
 quietly what a small advantage over 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.890
 The Barracuda is then considered to be a network 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.160
 480 watts be quite straight power e9 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.640
 modular 80 plus gold actually has 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.180
 90 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.650
 that means he is a maximum of 10 percent of 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.489
 Energy consumption contributes to heat 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.590
 the power supply 480 watts is enough for 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.200
 the future all necessary connections 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.820
 are also there and it is modular that 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.870
 means the cables can be removed with it 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.720
 they are not unnecessarily in the housing in it 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.799
 then another dvd burner from samsung 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.430
 similar to super nice and a housing 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.410
 by zahlmann the z 9 plus in midi tower 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:36.739
 very nice housing lights up front 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.690
 blue out, this has me 24 mm fan 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.989
 I know I was already installed 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.299
 you almost should say that you should 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.220
 a house tree are controversial than me 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.819
 was always front two pieces and have 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.680
 at the back 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.389
 that is a very good airflow 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.400
 yes here at the side is then the 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.190
 temporal cpu fan I became the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.150
 product and the time 120 mm fan 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.150
 Removing something for you 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.459
 there actually more or less 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.430
 it is necessary without a very good one 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.440
 air flow in the housing then arises 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.329
 I thank you for watching me 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.820
 I hope I could help you if that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.489
 video as a month is your r looks 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.709
 I'll go in the description and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.630
 click there on the link to 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.539
 latest gaming pc because it can be that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.000
 it already a newer 800th 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.569
 euro computer then gives up to the next 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.569
