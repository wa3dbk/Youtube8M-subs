00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello dear calm i love yes 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
 Christmas I will every time again 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.410
 to the little boy and understand 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.390
 not many at all 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 christmas muffle and that's how it strikes me 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.119
 not at all for me 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 Decoration a bit more effort to give 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.410
 and that's why we do one today 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 black and white chocolate co die 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.489
 needed ingredients are more likely 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.120
 spartan we need white couverture 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.670
 or chocolate as well as dark couverture 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.090
 chocolate or cake klausur and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 various cut out 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 I dine me than for the flat 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.280
 decided chocolate and see there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 I'm not saving fat today 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 they also chop them up, but they crime them 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 or cut seven smaller ones 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.460
 you see the money archive 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.739
 easy and then finally bowl 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 if you are done with it then off into the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.570
 water bath before but ever with 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 Baking paper laid baking tray 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.460
 provide 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.950
 because then we want ours 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.049
 Pour melted white chocolate into 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 a half filled pot with 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.320
 water only in the bowl with the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.320
 give character to chocolate 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.020
 these always melt in it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
 stir it very important 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
 water should not cook and above all 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.650
 no water is allowed in the drawer 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.659
 devices 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.009
 the liquid white chocolate now on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.259
 pour the baking paper and then 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.600
 smooth it out so that something like a 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 flat patties produced which then 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.729
 Looks like they're leaving 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 Cool white chocolate for a few minutes 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.509
 and liquefy parallel to the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.659
 dark chocolate or cake 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.159
 Glaze carry these now in yours 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.810
 uneven pattern on the white 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.250
 chocolate also makes the best of itself 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.930
 that in my opinion with a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.190
 teaspoon 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.020
 By the way, you also have exactly 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.970
 can therefore process the other way around as 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 base as the basis of the dark 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.610
 then take the chocolate with water 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.020
 baste 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.790
 but I have for this variant 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.680
 Of course, that's the way to go 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.259
 also everything can vary in color if one 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.030
 the white chocolate colors that way 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.010
 the result of we have to be the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 chocolate just a cool down but not 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 get very firm so about 20 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 About minutes and then it starts 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.660
 cut out and for what form the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.670
 you decide naturally 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.709
 completely leave to you a hint 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 however, the fewer corners and edges 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.239
 These companies have the easier it is 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.700
 of course with all that dissolve out so 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.500
 for example, heart bells and also 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.060
 Fir trees are very well suited 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.420
 object with her many tips 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 are much more complicated by the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.060
 one or the other will be the one 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.880
 Best fingertip feeling for that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.070
 needs so slowly something is coming 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.330
 conditions 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.500
 a short note still because I am myself 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.840
 yes, do not decorate with foreign feathers 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.900
 wants to have the idea for this video 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.670
 bake me with fun de brought and so 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.190
 It can then look like the end 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.230
 give away the deco chocolate lives it 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.269
 as jewelry for gifts or dix 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
 just the christmas party i wish 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.380
 Have fun while making your own 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.580
 a nice holiday season then up 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.580
 bye for the next time
