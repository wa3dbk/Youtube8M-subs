00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.430
 for many people talking in curves is a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.490
 temerity right 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.310
 but for others it's the beginning fun then 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.189
 Let's teach here how to approach any 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.510
 curve type is open closed in the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.759
 city â€‹â€‹in state 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.340
 it is important to understand that the principle is 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.160
 always the same as the main technique here 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.460
 it's the opposite of what everybody does 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 without realizing how the bike works 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.300
 maintained by the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 gyroscopic inspection of tires and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.380
 operation 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.600
 keep standing so if you have the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.220
 straight line you want to turn for example 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.310
 to the left 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.280
 just do an ong boost right by the side 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.420
 right the bike automatically goes 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.520
 start training 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.010
 You're going to make the curve. This is a 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.720
 that all motorcyclists use 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 the same without realizing 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.670
 but to enhance what you can do 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.299
 is to train on the street at home very slowly 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.070
 and filling of trying to play on the scoreboard 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.140
 preferably over 40 kilometers 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.240
 per hour and you will feel with a motorcycle 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.819
 will come here the score 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.829
 your way will get much more love is 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.590
 cool to always split a curve in three 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.460
 parts input tangency and output 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.609
 main 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.439
 never get in one more corner is there 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.689
 that accidents happen 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.979
 reduce speed bring to the march 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.030
 correct and there calculates trajectory 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.249
 intelligence by signing a little to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.409
 attraction and if you want to get a 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.630
 a little more sportsmanship you can 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.609
 do this at the exit of the curve when 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.409
 have already been on the lookout for a 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.280
 bit more acceleration with all 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.200
 safety 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.899
 what is the correct way to enter a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.179
 first you brake using 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.600
 two brakes with the bike standing 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.840
 never enter a fruity crown already in the curve 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.490
 you use only the engine brake and at the apex 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.340
 it starts in a little bit of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.889
 always using reservation against text 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 gently doing all this for shows 

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:10.190
 always balanced 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.560
 moreover it is very important that you 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.900
 try for the ideal track always 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.510
 trying to turn the curve into a straight line 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 clear without abusing the speed but for 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.780
 increase your visibility always coming 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.600
 of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 out by doing the tangency and 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 again leaving the bike and leaving the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.050
 end of the curve 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 to emi all the tips with the curves 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.130
 we need to be very attentive 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 always the conditions of the asphalt but here 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.819
 a tip 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.200
 regardless of the floor the technique are 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.450
 always the same 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.209
 so let's pay close attention and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.950
 of course enjoy the bike that's right staff 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.100
 people see you next time bye bye 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.100
 over there
