some girls wear makeup because they

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
some girls wear makeup because they
think<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.130> needed<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.060> assume

that<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> attitude<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.220> she<00:01:29.280> takes

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that that is the attitude that she takes

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
that that is the attitude that she takes
is<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.450> offensive<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> say

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
is pretty offensive which is not to say

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
not about you I don't wear makeup to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
not about you I don't wear makeup to
impress<00:02:00.750> anyone<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.439> wear<00:02:02.250> makeup<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
impress anyone I wear makeup for me and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
impress anyone I wear makeup for me and
not<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.509> anyone<00:02:03.990> else<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:05.250> don't<00:02:05.549> care

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
not for anyone else I really don't care

not for anyone else I really don't care
what<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.509> people<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.920> makeup

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
what other people think about my makeup

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.859 
what other people think about my makeup
and<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> attitude<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.720> all

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and I think that's the attitude that all

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.690 
and I think that's the attitude that all
makeup<00:02:10.110> where's<00:02:10.410> should<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.340> realized

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
makeup where's should have I realized

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.530 
makeup where's should have I realized
that<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.000> not

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that it's not

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
that it's not
is<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.780> some<00:02:12.930> people<00:02:13.200> wear<00:02:13.290> makeup<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
is that some people wear makeup to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
is that some people wear makeup to
impress<00:02:14.250> someone<00:02:14.459> else<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.060> again<00:02:15.329> it<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
impress someone else but again it is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110 
impress someone else but again it is
awfully<00:02:16.530> presumptuous<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.760> assume

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
awfully presumptuous of you to assume

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.479 
awfully presumptuous of you to assume
that<00:02:18.420> you're<00:02:18.629> like<00:02:18.959> freeing<00:02:19.739> her<00:02:20.069> from<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
that you're like freeing her from the

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.699 
that you're like freeing her from the
tyrannical<00:02:21.030> enslavement<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.989> society

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
tyrannical enslavement of society

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.399 
tyrannical enslavement of society
standards<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.459> beauty<00:02:23.640> when<00:02:24.090> she<00:02:24.540> hopefully

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
and one final note if you take into

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.890 
and one final note if you take into
account<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.909> this<00:02:33.060> person<00:02:33.390> has<00:02:33.510> probably

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
account that this person has probably

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.630 
account that this person has probably
voluntarily<00:02:34.709> chosen<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.310> wear<00:02:35.430> makeup

voluntarily chosen to wear makeup

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.309 
voluntarily chosen to wear makeup
because<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.299> like<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.540> way<00:02:36.840> they<00:02:36.989> look<00:02:37.019> with

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
because they like the way they look with

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.610 
because they like the way they look with
it<00:02:37.879> do<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:39.000> realize<00:02:39.540> how<00:02:39.750> harmful<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.409> to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
it do you realize how harmful it is to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.020 
it do you realize how harmful it is to
tell<00:02:40.799> them<00:02:40.950> they<00:02:41.069> look<00:02:41.280> better<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.579> different

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
tell them they look better a different

tell them they look better a different
way<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.359> think<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:42.719> most<00:02:42.840> cases<00:02:43.139> the<00:02:43.409> intention

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
way I think in most cases the intention

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.979 
way I think in most cases the intention
is<00:02:43.950> right<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.819> flawed<00:02:45.299> foundation

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
is right but it's flawed foundation

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.710 
is right but it's flawed foundation
leads<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> exact<00:02:47.340> harmful<00:02:47.939> reaction<00:02:48.569> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
leads to the exact harmful reaction that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.319 
leads to the exact harmful reaction that
they<00:02:48.900> are<00:02:49.170> made<00:02:50.129> lessly<00:02:50.430> trying<00:02:51.209> to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
they are made lessly trying to

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.240 
they are made lessly trying to
counteract<00:02:51.629> because<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.470> say<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.040> look

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
counteract because when you say you look

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
counteract because when you say you look
better<00:02:53.280> without<00:02:53.760> makeup<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> girl<00:02:54.840> who

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
better without makeup to a girl who

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.800 
better without makeup to a girl who
likes<00:02:55.590> herself<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.430> likes<00:02:56.730> her<00:02:56.909> makeup<00:02:57.299> with
