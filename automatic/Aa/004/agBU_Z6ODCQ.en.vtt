00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.080
 hello everyone for sure every childhood 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.879
 was such a device with which 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.009
 whiled away the time in the queues at the lessons then 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.509
 on couples in lectures a and we decided 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.310
 build exactly the same when crafting 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.560
 and make it a small mini toy 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.669
 called union cross a basically 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.140
 the hull were exactly the same as 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.160
 present life there is also a panel 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.500
 control with buttons 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.849
 if you press the red button here 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.040
 the device turns on accordingly 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.530
 screw up sit these lines machine there 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.890
 at the counter of lives there it is yes and the counter 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.899
 points 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 the main goal is not to get hit 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.980
 vertically find the phenomenon just by us 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.270
 unfortunately when recording is very bad 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.280
 chunks are loaded therefore it is necessary 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 drive from here to just 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.880
 small things were loaded and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.420
 allowed to be managed normally 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.370
 machine without problems well, because the main thing 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.800
 don't get on it and we had to reckon 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.450
 points and u20 mickey prizes for our efforts 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.610
 accordingly if we lose 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.850
 we will have no mass piece of heart 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.229
 and all luck is bad in the end well, 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.329
 by the way of the single player game we could 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.619
 achieve about 70 points and see 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.259
 how many will sweep the face at the same 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.270
 scenario the idea with falling residents was 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.639
 Need alcohol uman craft and 5 of them 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.229
 had the same idea to make tetris on 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:20.139
 based on you is just such incident 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.439
 blocks but you decide using that yourself 

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:24.939
 Tanya used as long as the input and well 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.399
 even you until you can even end 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.799
 hearts will give out our gold perfectly 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.649
 triggered the randomizer and kill our typewriter 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.060
 including down here but after the same 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.649
 Tetris death is fully activated 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.329
 by the way you can also control 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.929
 typewriter with the help of these blue ones 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.340
 buttons 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.829
 and for this you need to turn on again 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.329
 tetris and just push this mighty 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.789
 The body of these buttons inside just 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.009
 fly books and the cost of the machine 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.630
 empty position is necessary but 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.950
 since again there was no filming 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.060
 not very convenient to use and large 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.099
 buttons because just the whole thing 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.709
 bad immersing i used to attack 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.359
 miniatures of the controller here well let's 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.799
 again and turn it off because before you die 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.380
 like a regular vacuum cleaner to take off so 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.939
 further and there is also a magic 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.069
 night vision button 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.259
 so you can easily watch 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.580
 insides device over there 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.230
 some complicated mechanisms i'm honest 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.709
 mention and hit a little not maidens 103 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.730
 Hearts Baubles 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.490
 randomizer and these positions there and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
 a falling resident and stuff other stuff 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.590
 Well, if we look in the back wall 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 enclosures that is allowed to her back we 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.880
 see a very cool pixel art from 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.730
 mass effect'a 3 arena varnishes with 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.990
 gorgeous boobs 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.020
 Well, I just wanted such a movie myself 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.670
 get up owners from 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.350
 and there is also an explosion system if you 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.110
 this tetris is tired that is already like us 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.370
 such a tradition to blow up any device 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.250
 that is, click on this diamond 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.760
 a button and all that crap just takes off 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.620
