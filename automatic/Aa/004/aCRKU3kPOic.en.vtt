00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.200
 And, folks, it's my gift to revenge here and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 now back to pass to you a little 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.680
 of my knowledge of how to form 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.800
 well of the first 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 select that champion from your net law 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 you will 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:37.350
 top is to measure dote these things 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.290
 selecting champion is go train some 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.789
 twice or more until you pick up the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:57.649
 way forward in custom matches 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:57.649
 alone is ex in ruins and people are there 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:10.380
 One tip is you use champions who have a 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 low and not week or who can use more 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.299
 low cost of the week and have skills 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.070
 lovely and clear as zed catarina 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:30.180
 oriana is unpublished 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.600
 good first try not to advance 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.600
 way beyond making it easy 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 just the last hit to make sure she's going 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 die 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.920
 only the last ri je help click on the trofa 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 and you can see her dhpp bar here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.170
 last hit you will make your 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 lenny do not advance what it is to call 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 law n 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.520
 When you in ours it's called well. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.649
 that not getting near the clip you 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.110
 and we can say we deviate from 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.090
 some skill used by the enemy until 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.390
 avoid that use always try to give sun 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.769
 that last hit zin paranÃ¡ advances 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 solemnity putting you in danger or these 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:33.330
 things 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:39.620
 something like not squeezing 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:44.390
 you see the range of your character 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 try to stay away from the clip like I said 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.110
 and hit the last hit you 'll get the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.110
 The way the bag is getting used to the last 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.099
 hit you will know when the troop goes 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.680
 die when she will not talk enough 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.450
 accessible to say that this will 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.310
 help a lot 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.170
 practice alone when you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.680
 feel comfortable there even in a game 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:24.630
 normal to see if the tips worked and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 they did some comment there is not much 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 Thank you and see you next video
