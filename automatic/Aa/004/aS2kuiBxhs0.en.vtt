 Monthly Sagan Tosu 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.230
 From this week, we will change to the Furukawa Koji reporter and help Koberi . 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.720
 You wish Regards 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:27.260
 I would like to convey the hot battle of Sagan Tosu with all my strength 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:36.410
 So the US's First Yes Please tell from the team of results 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 j 1 Sagan Tosu finished October 5 of league match 28th round, total score 9 wins 6 divisions 13 losses 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.530
 Of 33 points 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 The ranking is 14th without change 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:53.579
 Looking back at the results of the September Toka Shonan game of those succumbed to Hiroshima last year champion 2 consecutive games in Saki game 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 It was a closed victory of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 In the wake of joining midfielder defender Kikuchi and goalkeeper Hayashi last season 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.939
 Supported the breakthrough 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.500
 Are you getting back a solid defense ? 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.620
 It feels like a strong return 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.100
 By the way, it is mvp for the month of September 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.980
 Newly added defender who supported such hard defense 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.120
 Naoki Kikuchi was chosen 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.560
 Yes 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:28.040
 Kikuchi is committed to rebuilding the field and transfers from Albirex Niigata with a deadline in late July. 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 The 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.740
 From the first half of the second half of the first season right after joining the center back to establish a starting point and accurate positioning 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.549
 We summarized defense in coaching 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.870
 Sagan Tosu scored 40 goals in 17 games 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.800
 Reversal from the first half 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:58.680
 A total of 10 goals in the second half of the 10 games, including Kikuchi, was 12 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:05.930
 The fact that the average score for the five games decreased by one or more points has led to the team's strength 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 Please see the interview of mvp Naoki Kikuchi during the month of September here. 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.260
 In the second half of the game, defense has stabilized, but there are things that I keep in mind during the game 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 Is not it 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.310
 That's why I have a feeling of distance to everyone since I entered 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.310
 I'm talking about trying to be very important 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.760
 For the remaining 6 games in the mountains 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.890
 I'm fighting, but as a team I hate the goal as an individual again 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.540
 Please give me 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.310
 Well Maaetto 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.580
 I think that there is a lot of balance to do when we are moving 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.070
 Since not a number like can still rest assured First together 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.650
 Since I think that I want to do my best aiming at the top again, I would like support again 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.310
 I will 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.310
 Thank you very much 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.410
 I would like to look forward to the success of Kikuchi, so then Sagan Tosu in the league in October 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:09.640
 It is a highlight 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:16.750
 Yes in October the Niigata match of the 28th section was held on 5th but lost 1 to 3 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:21.470
 We collide with Shimizu S pulse of 12th in enemy ground on the 19th 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 Home match in April lost 0 to 1 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.620
 Goalkeeper Hayashi, who is transferring from Shimizu with a due date 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.590
 Because I can not participate 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.660
 Expectations will be taken by the goalkeeper Akaboshi 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.500
 On the 27th with Celesso Osaka 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.650
 Make the only home game this month 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.760
 1 to 4 defeat in July's away game 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:55.470
 After a draw in last season's j 1 opener 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 It is a bad match with the official match 4 consecutive losses including the Nabisco Cup 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.510
 I think that I want you to seal a comprehensive force the rich talent team of Cerezo Osaka 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.100
 Six seasons remaining 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:17.380
 The relegation zone 16 is only eight points away from Shonan 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.380
 It is what I want you to determine quickly the fight j 1 remaining in the remaining game best 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.430
 Let's keep supporting all the supporters to the end 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.860
 Yes, supporters support is the power of sake 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.860
 Thank you Thank you for kelp's
