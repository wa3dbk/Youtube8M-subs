 you can invite players from 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.190
 enemy teams 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.750
 conditions for doing all base and task 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.759
 for reinforced areas on the test simplified 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:20.550

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.069
 not yet known in update 098 will be released 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.819

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.160
 details about the version of the developers 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.830
 There is no solution to the problem with gold since 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.959
 there is no option developers 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.819
 recognizes that the problem is in common as 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.399
 ordinary shells still gold 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.759
 excessive penetration of some guns 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.250
 There are cases in the game when the projectile in general 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.190
 didn't fly out like i shot effect was 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.319
 due to packet loss introduction 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.679

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.239
 never yet a mirror balance of teams 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.670
 the game will never be 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.860
 situation with balance when for example 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.690
 you get on level 100 to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.789
 tenth level where the team 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.729

 changes tth art-sau developers a lot 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.790

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 additions to changes the mechanic will still 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.100
 many stages of testing excellence 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.209

 as well as participation in auctions for influence 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.900

 fortified areas 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.680

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.530

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.280
 millimeters but e100 is on the contrary lucky

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.100
 they theoretically should not 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.620
 nothing to interfere but no one denies
