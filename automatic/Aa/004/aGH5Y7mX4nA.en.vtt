you guys and today's video unboxing is

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.990 
you guys and today's video unboxing is
gonna<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> headset<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.860> as<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.940> see

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
gonna be on a headset and as you can see

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
gonna be on a headset and as you can see
right<00:00:12.389> there<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.660> headset<00:00:13.380> looks<00:00:13.950> pretty

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
right there that headset looks pretty

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
right there that headset looks pretty
similar<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.269> something<00:00:15.750> I've<00:00:15.929> done<00:00:16.139> maybe<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
similar to something I've done maybe a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.960 
similar to something I've done maybe a
year<00:00:17.550> ago<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:19.320> you'd<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.310> right

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
year ago and you'd be actually right

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.529 
year ago and you'd be actually right
because<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.560> tactic<00:00:23.460> 3d<00:00:24.150> Rath

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
because this is the tactic 3d Rath

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.370 
because this is the tactic 3d Rath
headset<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:27.029> tactic<00:00:27.420> 3d<00:00:27.720> rath<00:00:27.960> had<00:00:28.199> set

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
headset and the tactic 3d rath had set

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.009 
headset and the tactic 3d rath had set
is<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.710> among<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.580> tactic<00:00:30.179> 3d<00:00:30.570> family

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
is actually among the tactic 3d family

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
is actually among the tactic 3d family
as<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> tell<00:00:31.710> by<00:00:31.890> its<00:00:31.920> name<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.940> means

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
as you can tell by its name which means

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
as you can tell by its name which means
it's<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.690> similar<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.710> tactic

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it's going to be similar to the tactic

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's going to be similar to the tactic
3d<00:00:35.670> Sigma<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.320> reviewed

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
3d Sigma which I have reviewed

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.090 
3d Sigma which I have reviewed
previously<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.850> well<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> couple<00:00:39.660> other

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
previously as well as a couple other

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.830 
previously as well as a couple other
tactic<00:00:41.100> 3d<00:00:41.550> headsets<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> line<00:00:42.600> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
tactic 3d headsets in this line so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
tactic 3d headsets in this line so
there's<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> tactic<00:00:43.829> 3d<00:00:44.160> alpha<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.789> well

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there's also the tactic 3d alpha as well

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.650 
there's also the tactic 3d alpha as well
as<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> tactic<00:00:45.930> 3d<00:00:46.320> Omega<00:00:46.969> where<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.270> Omega

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
as the tactic 3d Omega where the Omega

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.350 
as the tactic 3d Omega where the Omega
is<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> wireless<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.890> well<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
is gonna be a wireless as well as this

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.830 
is gonna be a wireless as well as this
one<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.079> wrath<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.160> let's<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.420> box<00:00:54.629> open

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.119 
one the wrath so let's get this box open
and<00:00:55.230> let's<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.430> we've<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.699> inside

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
and let's see what we've got inside

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
and let's see what we've got inside
alright<00:00:59.129> guys<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.730> while<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.449> opening<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
box here we're going to run through a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
box here we're going to run through a
couple<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.260> features<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> guys<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
couple of features so you guys know that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.870 
couple of features so you guys know that
what<00:01:06.180> you're<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.650> tactic<00:01:08.310> 3d

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
what you're gonna get with the tactic 3d

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
what you're gonna get with the tactic 3d
wrath<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.930> couple<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> main<00:01:11.130> features

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
wrath so a couple of the main features

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
wrath so a couple of the main features
it's<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> steel<00:01:12.510> core<00:01:12.869> headband<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's got a steel core headband which

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's got a steel core headband which
means<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> gonna<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> quite<00:01:14.580> durable<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
means it's gonna be quite durable and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
means it's gonna be quite durable and
that<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.290> exactly<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.130> saw<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that is exactly what we saw on the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880 
that is exactly what we saw on the
tactic<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.659> d<00:01:18.810> Sigma<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> looks<00:01:19.650> like

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
tactic to be d Sigma so it looks like

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
tactic to be d Sigma so it looks like
it's<00:01:20.400> gonna<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.750> same

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it's gonna be pretty much the same

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's gonna be pretty much the same
design<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.360> 3d<00:01:24.360> sigma<00:01:24.689> except<00:01:25.049> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
design as the 3d sigma except you're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
design as the 3d sigma except you're
gonna<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> Wireless<00:01:25.979> functionality<00:01:26.909> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
gonna get that Wireless functionality so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
gonna get that Wireless functionality so
on<00:01:27.720> top<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.500> 50

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
on top of that you're gonna get 50

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
on top of that you're gonna get 50
millimeter<00:01:29.369> full<00:01:30.299> spectrum<00:01:30.869> speakers<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.590> aka

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
millimeter full spectrum speakers or aka

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880 
millimeter full spectrum speakers or aka
drivers<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.570> creative<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.500> calls<00:01:34.740> them

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
drivers and creative just calls them

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
drivers and creative just calls them
full<00:01:35.130> spectrum<00:01:35.549> speakers<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.329> they're

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
full spectrum speakers but they're

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
full spectrum speakers but they're
pretty<00:01:36.600> much<00:01:36.840> drivers<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.939> since<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.119> are

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
pretty much drivers and since they are

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.390 
pretty much drivers and since they are
50<00:01:39.780> millimeters<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.500> am<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.890> assume<00:01:41.189> they're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
50 millimeters I am gonna assume they're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.690 
50 millimeters I am gonna assume they're
gonna<00:01:41.490> sound<00:01:42.049> sort<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.710> tactic<00:01:44.310> 3d

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
gonna sound sort of like the tactic 3d

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
gonna sound sort of like the tactic 3d
Sigma<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.630> does<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:46.079> well<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.560> mean

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
Sigma so what does that mean well I mean

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.429 
Sigma so what does that mean well I mean
it's<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:48.090> bit<00:01:48.420> heavy<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it's gonna be a little bit heavy on the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.300 
it's gonna be a little bit heavy on the
bass<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.420> it's<00:01:51.420> gonna<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.950> still<00:01:53.070> gonna

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
bass and it's gonna be it's still gonna

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
bass and it's gonna be it's still gonna
be<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.939> still<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.840> know

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
be good it's still gonna be you know

simulates surround sound with your

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.090 
simulates surround sound with your
headset<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:02.290> say<00:03:03.290> you're<00:03:03.500> playing<00:03:03.620> game<00:03:04.070> with

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100

headset so say you're playing game with
5.1<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.030> 7.1<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.050> its<00:03:06.350> gonna<00:03:06.500> simulate<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
5.1 or 7.1 what its gonna simulate the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.660 
5.1 or 7.1 what its gonna simulate the
sound<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:08.780> your<00:03:08.840> headset<00:03:09.550> because<00:03:10.550> your

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
sound in your headset because your

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.400 
sound in your headset because your
headset<00:03:11.030> only<00:03:11.180> has<00:03:11.450> two<00:03:11.660> speakers<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:12.200> not

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
headset only has two speakers it's not

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.500 
headset only has two speakers it's not
actually<00:03:12.830> five<00:03:13.070> or<00:03:13.280> 7.1<00:03:13.910> surround

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
actually five or 7.1 surround

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.310 
actually five or 7.1 surround
but<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:15.980> simulate<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:17.000> by<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.690> know<00:03:17.720> using<00:03:17.989> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
but they simulate it by you know using a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.470 
but they simulate it by you know using a
lot<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.680> audio<00:03:19.070> magic<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:19.790> order<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.209> make<00:03:20.360> it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
lot of audio magic in order to make it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.190 
lot of audio magic in order to make it
sound<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.989> it's<00:03:21.230> 7.1<00:03:22.010> or<00:03:22.250> 5.1<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:24.080> we

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
sound like it's 7.1 or 5.1 so here we

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.140 
sound like it's 7.1 or 5.1 so here we
have<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.470> microphone<00:03:24.769> looks<00:03:25.400> very<00:03:25.730> standard

have the microphone looks very standard
looks<00:03:26.360> very<00:03:26.720> much<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.440> old<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:27.769> looks

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
looks very much like the old one looks

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.210 
looks very much like the old one looks
like<00:03:28.790> they<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.120> added<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.660> couple<00:03:29.900> hooks<00:03:30.290> we

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
like they have added a couple hooks we

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.210 
like they have added a couple hooks we
right<00:03:31.489> at<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.820> end<00:03:32.000> there<00:03:32.360> next<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.470> mics

right at the end there next to the mics
windscreen<00:03:35.180> or<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.540> don't<00:03:35.930> know<00:03:35.989> whether<00:03:36.170> they

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.559 
the
on<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.500> know<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.040> tactic<00:03:44.459> 3<00:03:44.640> D<00:03:44.700> Sigma<00:03:44.970> they

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
on I I know the tactic 3 D Sigma they

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.000 
on I I know the tactic 3 D Sigma they
didn't<00:03:45.780> really<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.680> kept

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
didn't really have that so it kept

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.070 
didn't really have that so it kept
falling<00:03:47.400> off<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.879> you<00:03:48.360> know<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.660> was<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.989> of

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
falling off and you know that was one of

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.070 
falling off and you know that was one of
the<00:03:49.200> issues<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.860> faced<00:03:50.310> but<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.959> we

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the issues that I faced but here we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.020 
the issues that I faced but here we
could<00:03:52.200> look<00:03:52.379> at<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.620> headset<00:03:53.040> itself<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.910> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
could look at the headset itself and it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.559 
could look at the headset itself and it
looks<00:03:54.300> very<00:03:54.810> very<00:03:54.989> similar<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.700> tactic<00:03:57.269> 3

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
looks very very similar to the tactic 3

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.559 
looks very very similar to the tactic 3
D<00:03:57.690> Sigma<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.950> all<00:03:59.099> know<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.640> love<00:03:59.849> so<00:04:00.360> in

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
D Sigma that we all know and love so in

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.449 
D Sigma that we all know and love so in
there<00:04:00.720> we've<00:04:00.900> got<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.140> steel<00:04:01.650> core<00:04:01.950> headband

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
there we've got that steel core headband

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.750 
there we've got that steel core headband
so<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:02.849> gonna<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.120> extremely<00:04:03.360> durable<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
so it's gonna be extremely durable and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000 
so it's gonna be extremely durable and
extremely<00:04:05.760> tough<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.650> we've<00:04:07.799> got

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
extremely tough and up here we've got

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.009 
extremely tough and up here we've got
that<00:04:08.400> nice<00:04:08.760> layer<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.239> padding<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:09.870> gonna

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
that nice layer of padding that's gonna

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.960 
that nice layer of padding that's gonna
be<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:10.500> comfortable<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.190> your<00:04:11.280> head<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
be very comfortable for your head and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.030 
be very comfortable for your head and
right<00:04:12.750> there<00:04:12.930> we've<00:04:13.079> got<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.530> leatherette

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
right there we've got that leatherette

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.960 
right there we've got that leatherette
ear<00:04:14.430> pad<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.030> I'm<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.079> sure<00:04:16.139> I'm<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:17.160> very<00:04:17.669> big

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
ear pad so I'm not sure I'm a very big

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.690 
ear pad so I'm not sure I'm a very big
fan<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.630> leather<00:04:18.840> earpads<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:20.579> know

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
fan of the leather earpads you know

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
fan of the leather earpads you know
those<00:04:21.630> maybe<00:04:22.560> after<00:04:22.919> like<00:04:23.070> 2<00:04:23.310> or<00:04:23.340> 3<00:04:23.520> hours<00:04:24.150> your

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
those maybe after like 2 or 3 hours your

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.530 
those maybe after like 2 or 3 hours your
ears<00:04:25.080> do<00:04:25.410> get<00:04:25.710> kind<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.010> hot<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.610> they<00:04:27.240> do<00:04:27.300> get

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
ears do get kind of hot and they do get

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.969 
ears do get kind of hot and they do get
kind<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.840> sweaty<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.620> little

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
kind of sweaty and a little

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.400 
kind of sweaty and a little
uncomfortable<00:04:29.340> especially<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.020> live

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
uncomfortable especially if you live

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.010 
uncomfortable especially if you live
somewhere<00:04:31.919> like<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.940> California<00:04:33.419> where

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
somewhere like I do in California where

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.350 
somewhere like I do in California where
you<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.710> it's<00:04:34.830> always<00:04:34.979> sunny<00:04:35.400> here<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:36.000> it's

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
you know it's always sunny here and it's

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.090 
you know it's always sunny here and it's
just<00:04:36.450> gonna<00:04:36.690> get<00:04:36.930> hot<00:04:37.169> after<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> while<00:04:37.830> but

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
just gonna get hot after a while but

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.370 
just gonna get hot after a while but
down<00:04:38.729> there<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.120> did<00:04:39.300> see<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.900> USB

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
down there you did see the the USB

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.439 
down there you did see the the USB
connector<00:04:40.770> for<00:04:41.220> charging<00:04:41.280> your<00:04:41.880> headphones

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
connector for charging your headphones

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.260 
connector for charging your headphones
as<00:04:42.690> well<00:04:42.720> as<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.289> microphone<00:04:43.800> port<00:04:44.130> up<00:04:44.700> front

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
as well as the microphone port up front

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.840 
as well as the microphone port up front
here<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.050> got<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.320> power<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.280> volume<00:04:47.460> up

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
here you got the power and the volume up

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.909 
here you got the power and the volume up
and<00:04:48.090> down<00:04:48.150> buttons<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.990> as<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.260> can<00:04:49.410> see<00:04:49.620> with

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
and down buttons and as you can see with

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.800 
and down buttons and as you can see with
me<00:04:50.520> pushing<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.030> power<00:04:51.210> button<00:04:51.330> the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
me pushing the power button the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.879 
me pushing the power button the
headphones<00:04:52.350> did<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:53.010> pop<00:04:53.789> alive<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.750> I

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
headphones did just pop alive and and I

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.830 
headphones did just pop alive and and I
guess<00:04:55.889> at<00:04:56.340> least<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.820> know<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.479> pair<00:04:57.810> of

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
guess at least we know this pair of

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.060 
guess at least we know this pair of
headphones<00:04:58.440> are<00:04:59.099> gonna<00:04:59.340> be<00:05:00.139> LED<00:05:01.139> lit<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.770> the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
headphones are gonna be LED lit on the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.390 
headphones are gonna be LED lit on the
ear<00:05:02.280> cups<00:05:02.550> at<00:05:02.729> least<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.210> know<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.470> tactic<00:05:05.039> 3<00:05:05.250> D

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
ear cups at least I know the tactic 3 D

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.580 
ear cups at least I know the tactic 3 D
Sigma<00:05:05.639> wasn't<00:05:06.240> lit<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.169> was<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.380> little

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
Sigma wasn't lit and it was a little

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.740 
Sigma wasn't lit and it was a little
disappointing<00:05:07.919> because<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.639> couple<00:05:08.910> blue<00:05:09.210> LEDs

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
disappointing because a couple blue LEDs

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.540 
disappointing because a couple blue LEDs
there<00:05:10.050> would<00:05:10.320> have<00:05:10.410> looked<00:05:10.650> fantastic

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
there would have looked fantastic

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.500 
there would have looked fantastic
and<00:05:12.800> there's<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:14.039> headphone<00:05:14.460> attached<00:05:14.970> so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
and there's the headphone attached so

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.850 
and there's the headphone attached so
that's<00:05:15.990> how<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.680> headsets<00:05:17.160> gonna<00:05:17.400> look<00:05:17.729> after

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
that's how the headsets gonna look after

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.560 
that's how the headsets gonna look after
everything<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:20.010> put<00:05:20.250> together<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.940> gotta

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
everything is put together and gotta

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.779 
everything is put together and gotta
admit<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.110> is<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.289> pretty<00:05:22.830> good<00:05:23.190> looking<00:05:23.580> pair

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
admit it is a pretty good looking pair

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.330 
admit it is a pretty good looking pair
of<00:05:23.910> headphones<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:25.349> microphone<00:05:25.979> does

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
of headphones the the microphone does

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.580 
of headphones the the microphone does
look<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.729> little<00:05:26.849> off<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.660> thought<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.440> looked

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
look a little off I thought it looked

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.920 
look a little off I thought it looked
off<00:05:28.889> with<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.490> tactic<00:05:29.940> 3<00:05:30.120> D<00:05:30.180> Sigma<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.840> it

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
off with the tactic 3 D Sigma and it

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.540 
off with the tactic 3 D Sigma and it
looks<00:05:31.110> like<00:05:31.169> they<00:05:31.440> kept<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.950> same<00:05:32.130> design

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
looks like they kept to the same design

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.150 
looks like they kept to the same design
so<00:05:33.020> I'm<00:05:34.020> gonna<00:05:34.229> have<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.410> full<00:05:34.620> review<00:05:34.800> for<00:05:35.070> you

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
so I'm gonna have a full review for you

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.879 
so I'm gonna have a full review for you
guys<00:05:35.190> soon<00:05:35.970> enough<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:37.440> know<00:05:37.530> it's<00:05:37.770> gonna

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
guys soon enough you know it's gonna

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.010 
guys soon enough you know it's gonna
pretty<00:05:38.280> much<00:05:38.370> be<00:05:38.760> a<00:05:38.789> test<00:05:39.150> of<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.539> wireless

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
pretty much be a test of the wireless

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.080 
pretty much be a test of the wireless
ability<00:05:40.440> because<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.770> believe<00:05:41.160> this<00:05:41.669> headset

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
ability because I believe this headset

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.750 
ability because I believe this headset
should<00:05:42.419> have<00:05:42.630> similar<00:05:43.620> characteristics<00:05:44.490> to

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
should have similar characteristics to

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.719 
should have similar characteristics to
the<00:05:44.880> tactic<00:05:45.419> 3<00:05:45.660> D<00:05:45.810> Sigma<00:05:46.050> but<00:05:46.530> definitely<00:05:47.490> stay

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
the tactic 3 D Sigma but definitely stay

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.250 
the tactic 3 D Sigma but definitely stay
tuned<00:05:47.940> for<00:05:48.150> that<00:05:48.210> I've<00:05:48.570> got<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.810> couple<00:05:49.050> more

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
tuned for that I've got a couple more

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260 
tuned for that I've got a couple more
product<00:05:49.650> shots<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.580> if<00:05:50.849> you<00:05:50.940> guys<00:05:51.060> are

these keyboards and one of the functions

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.310 
these keyboards and one of the functions
that<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.760> found<00:06:21.120> really<00:06:21.420> cool<00:06:21.540> with<00:06:22.170> the

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
that I found really cool with the

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.890 
that I found really cool with the
backlighting<00:06:22.980> is<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.460> fact<00:06:23.730> that<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:24.720> can

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
backlighting is the fact that you can

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.920 
backlighting is the fact that you can
set<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.260> to<00:06:25.290> a<00:06:25.470> mode<00:06:26.130> called<00:06:26.730> a<00:06:27.030> pulsing<00:06:27.690> mode

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
set it to a mode called a pulsing mode

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.570 
set it to a mode called a pulsing mode
and<00:06:28.490> that<00:06:29.490> would<00:06:29.730> be<00:06:29.850> the<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:31.440> top<00:06:32.040> you

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
and that would be the the the top you

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.300 
and that would be the the the top you
know<00:06:32.700> mode<00:06:33.450> on<00:06:33.840> this<00:06:34.140> keyboard<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:34.890> when<00:06:35.190> you
