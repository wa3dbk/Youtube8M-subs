00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 yes for the first time the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 channel cameras hear you lead 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.610
 today at Ooyonnax first match of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.179
 top 14 for the promoted first match to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.920
 home 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.049
 obviously and not facing anyone 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 facing the ogre and Clermont 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.340
 so little puffet did he shine for 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 this gala premiere in front of his audience 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.420
 images the reactions analyzes of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.420
 pallets all signed I want to 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.220
 before returning to the lawn doubt 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 the invaded clearly was he going to them 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 crush they really had the level 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 to survive in top 14 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.739
 will he live up to the expectations of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 their audience a lot of noises from the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.850
 color the reception of the supporters is at 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 the height of the event immediately 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 sending Venetian players are in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.680
 the match magically 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.180
 the doubt flew away came out this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 frustrated theme in the other match at 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 bayonne did not know how to play our game 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 that today we do not need that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 so if we have to lose the match he 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.629
 had to clearly go well 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.629
 search 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.620
 without complex oyonnax gains ground 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 taking risks 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.860
 the fronts are blocked two meters from 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.440
 the goal line of clermont the hooker 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
 South African jody jenneker surprises everything 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.920
 the world and marks in two stages the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.690
 first try for oyonnax sets to zero 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 surprise the promoted is in the lead 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.290
 clearly stung to the quick hands 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 on the ball and occupy the 22 meters 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 opponents the sand and big game this big 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.030
 james disagreement and comfort at worst 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.300
 I 'm the sprint yacine hima all right 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 pushed back to a corner 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.549
 two thirds but if there is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.659
 if you do not get put the arrow if one of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.659
 our sivivatu people 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 we have a defense who who are trying to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 go up fast to put pressure and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.320
 there I see the ball hanging around 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.789
 at level 2 of 40 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.329
 I play at the foot and after I see 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.770
 sivivatu and marcelin who come to you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.509
 all in January so I'm free 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 in the news we will leave and at the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.850
 run and flo followed well and that's what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 which makes steenbarger swing 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.829
 path of 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.690
 it's like the rigor that we will work 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.890
 I'll have to go back to soccer 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.280
 to face the two firefighters he's 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.660
 left a little sideline florian denos the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.160
 best test marker of pro d2 la 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.560
 last season enter the second 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.660
 try for oyonnax no you do not dream 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.050
 the little pouch even 20 to 0 at the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.250
 half-time just cauter in second 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.970
 period is coming back heavy with 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.980
 nalaga parra and backgammon immediate effect 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.560
 Ooyonnax no longer touches a recoil 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 and spends his time defending gherard 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.630
 Vosloo 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.190
 the third South African line of 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.019
 clermont saw that the defense had 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.150
 neglected lax of grouping essay 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.700
 unstoppable clermont nibbles his delay 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.530
 the score on the hour and 23 to 14 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.549
 jenneker just out for ten 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.890
 minutes for a punch 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.700
 christophe urios the manager of yona meaning 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 to intervene 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 daddy gallagher badminton 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.620
 at 14 against 15 urios men 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.330
 does not accept a trial that the author has 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.750
 understood his team just let 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.750
 take a chance 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.520
 cheat hand dale affixed on the line 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.540
 and sir cardona asks again 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.090
 the test is granted by the video referee 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.190
 at valentin bear at the dock the president of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.260
 yona jean marc mondus at home can leave 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.010
 explode his joy his team to eat 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.900
 the Clermont ogre 30 to 19 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.100
 I do not want to say that we are afraid but we 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.510
 had tremendous pressure 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.090
 so of course today at full 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 errors but that it bis and sebo 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.790
 in his stadiums 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.220
 I love this club it's fabulous we did it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.319

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 his senior senior freezes nothing there I have 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.620
 caught up with the criminal in the top 14 going 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.470
 maybe finally be a top team 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.910
 14 make clear image proof 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.540
 remained on the ground to greet the 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.220
 winners and arrives at the top 14 in the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.600
 Donor bottoms here is the respect 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.470
 that there is in rugby is respect 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.610
 big teams because all the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.700
 world would not have done in rugby 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.890
 there is respect towards the supporters 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.030
 the referees the players and that's it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.130

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.980
 the most beautiful rewards for their 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.690
 supporters we so want to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.460
