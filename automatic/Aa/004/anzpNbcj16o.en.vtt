betting<00:03:18.750> charisma<00:03:19.320> better<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.860> power<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.340> think

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
betting charisma better in power I think

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.990 
betting charisma better in power I think
but<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:22.050> good<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.740> toughness<00:03:23.190> which<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
but not as good in toughness which is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.030 
but not as good in toughness which is
the<00:03:24.390> one<00:03:24.720> step<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.020> he's<00:03:25.410> been<00:03:25.590> produced<00:03:25.950> to
