00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.369 
the Victoria's adventure Swiss Army now
I<00:00:13.170> think<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> pretty<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:14.940> knife

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
I think this is a pretty good knife

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.279 
I think this is a pretty good knife
because<00:00:16.430> it's<00:00:17.430> simple<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.869> everything<00:00:19.230> you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because it's simple about everything you

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.529 
because it's simple about everything you
need<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:21.390> also<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:22.109> Swiss<00:00:22.650> Army<00:00:22.830> knife

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
need and it is also a Swiss Army knife

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.470 
need and it is also a Swiss Army knife
that<00:00:24.539> locks<00:00:25.279> I'm<00:00:26.279> pushing<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.730> back<00:00:27.029> pretty

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that locks I'm pushing that back pretty

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.420 
that locks I'm pushing that back pretty
hard<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.260> won't<00:00:28.500> budge<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.900> unlock<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.030 

what<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:37.230> covering<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> blade

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
what you do is it's covering the blade

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
what you do is it's covering the blade
right<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> push<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.290> down

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
right here so you have to push it down

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.369 
right here so you have to push it down
so<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.100> packed<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> blade<00:00:42.230> hold<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so it's not packed on the blade hold the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.190 
so it's not packed on the blade hold the
blade<00:00:43.590> up

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
blade up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.189 
blade up
so<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> lock<00:00:46.590> can't<00:00:46.920> come<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> close

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so the lock can't come back on and close

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.790 
so the lock can't come back on and close
it<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.190> tools<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:57.320> can<00:00:58.320> opener

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it so the tools it has are can opener

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.469 
it so the tools it has are can opener

if the lock is also on the bottle opener

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.130 
if the lock is also on the bottle opener
I<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.360> see<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:26.569> they<00:03:26.690> put<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.050> an

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
I don't see what they put it on an

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.650 
I don't see what they put it on an
opener<00:03:27.730> sitting<00:03:28.730> that's<00:03:28.910> always<00:03:29.090> pushing<00:03:29.630> the

opener sitting that's always pushing the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.530 
opener sitting that's always pushing the
opposite<00:03:30.170> way<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.630> get<00:03:33.370> same<00:03:34.370> thing<00:03:34.670> push

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
opposite way but we get same thing push

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.680 
opposite way but we get same thing push
it<00:03:35.660> over<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.620> not<00:03:36.800> covering<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.540> can

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
it over it's not covering it and you can

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.440 
it over it's not covering it and you can
close<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:40.370> side<00:03:40.670> there<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.000> a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
close it on this side there is a

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.610 
close it on this side there is a
corkscrew<00:03:43.060> which<00:03:44.140> as<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.290> see<00:03:45.410> it's

corkscrew which as you can see it's

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.229 
corkscrew which as you can see it's
corkscrew<00:03:46.190> do<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.670> really<00:03:46.940> need<00:03:47.090> to

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
corkscrew do I really need to

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.910 
corkscrew do I really need to
demonstrate<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:53.260> these<00:03:54.260> are<00:03:54.410> always<00:03:54.560> hard

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
demonstrate it and these are always hard

no<00:04:27.680> most<00:04:28.039> of<00:04:28.190> its<00:04:28.340> knife<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.729> it's<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.910> regular

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
no most of its knife so it's a regular

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
round shapes right in the middle so it

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.760 
round shapes right in the middle so it
doesn't<00:04:31.250> matter<00:04:31.430> what<00:04:31.850> side<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.330> put<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.630> on

these it's like a little bit of a curve
there<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.580> only<00:04:37.760> fit<00:04:38.090> on<00:04:38.210> one<00:04:38.419> side<00:04:39.310> cuz<00:04:40.310> I'm

there so only fit on one side cuz I'm

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.580 
there so only fit on one side cuz I'm
about<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.970> demonstrate<00:04:41.229> I'll<00:04:42.229> take<00:04:42.470> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
about to demonstrate I'll take the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.440 
about to demonstrate I'll take the
toothpick<00:04:42.830> goes<00:04:43.340> from<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.640> other<00:04:43.789> side<00:04:44.120> and

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
toothpick goes from the other side and

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.000 
toothpick goes from the other side and
angle<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.600> opposite<00:04:47.930> direction<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.620> won't<00:04:48.860> go

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
angle the opposite direction it won't go

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.430 
angle the opposite direction it won't go
in

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.430 

so<00:04:56.330> comes<00:04:57.330> with<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.510> few<00:04:57.690> cars<00:04:57.900> I've<00:04:58.110> seen<00:04:58.290> in

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
red and black the only two colors but I

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.410 
red and black the only two colors but I
know<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.590> probably<00:05:01.740> more<00:05:02.160> about<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.240> red

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
know it was probably more about the red

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.240 
know it was probably more about the red
and<00:05:03.570> white<00:05:03.720> Swiss<00:05:04.080> crest<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.040> one<00:05:05.190> a

and white Swiss crest I like that one a

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.150 
and white Swiss crest I like that one a
bit<00:05:05.310> more<00:05:05.640> than<00:05:05.970> silver<00:05:06.390> one<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:07.020> think<00:05:07.920> just

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
bit more than silver one I think just

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.820 
bit more than silver one I think just
looks<00:05:08.340> cool<00:05:08.630> so<00:05:09.630> yeah<00:05:09.900> if<00:05:10.140> I'd<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.440> reap<00:05:10.620> this

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
looks cool so yeah if I'd to reap this

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.580 
looks cool so yeah if I'd to reap this

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
a seven

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.550 
a seven
considering<00:05:15.110> blocking<00:05:16.110> blade<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:21.440> it's<00:05:22.440> got

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
considering blocking blade and it's got

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.740 
considering blocking blade and it's got
a<00:05:22.590> good<00:05:22.800> can<00:05:23.100> opener<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.670> bottle<00:05:24.000> opener<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
a good can opener and bottle opener and

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.960 
a good can opener and bottle opener and
also<00:05:27.750> if<00:05:27.900> you<00:05:28.020> pull<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.290> blade<00:05:28.500> out<00:05:28.970> house

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
also if you pull the blade out house

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.160 
also if you pull the blade out house
these<00:05:30.090> indents<00:05:30.630> for<00:05:30.660> your<00:05:30.870> fingers<00:05:31.230> so<00:05:33.170> I'll

give it a 7 out of 10 there any

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.100 
give it a 7 out of 10 there any
improvements<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.470> think<00:05:37.680> they<00:05:37.770> could<00:05:37.950> make

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
improvements I think they could make

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.510 
improvements I think they could make
probably<00:05:40.110> be<00:05:41.660> wood<00:05:42.660> saw<00:05:43.020> blade<00:05:43.410> it's<00:05:44.340> called

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
probably be wood saw blade it's called

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.510 
probably be wood saw blade it's called
the<00:05:44.580> adventurer<00:05:45.060> so<00:05:45.740> for<00:05:46.740> going<00:05:47.010> out<00:05:47.130> on<00:05:47.160> hikes

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
the adventurer so for going out on hikes

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.430 
the adventurer so for going out on hikes
and<00:05:47.820> stuff<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.180> guess<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.690> think<00:05:48.930> there<00:05:49.140> is<00:05:49.260> also

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
and stuff I guess I think there is also
