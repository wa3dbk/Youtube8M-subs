like the boxes I like the packaging
let's<00:01:36.570> take<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> look

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
let's take a look

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.600 
let's take a look
after<00:01:37.799> tactic<00:01:38.189> striking<00:01:39.560> now<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> $80<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
after tactic striking now this is $80 so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
after tactic striking now this is $80 so
for<00:01:41.880> $80<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> expect<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> nice<00:01:43.229> pack<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.860> nice

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
for $80 you expect a nice pack in a nice

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
for $80 you expect a nice pack in a nice
presentation<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:46.049> deliver<00:01:47.840> ok

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
presentation and they deliver ok

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.999 
presentation and they deliver ok
protects<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.710> shock<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> drop<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.770> see

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
protects for shock and drop you can see

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.600 
protects for shock and drop you can see
this<00:01:53.130> case<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> screwin<00:01:54.420> cases<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
this case is one of the screwin cases so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280

but now let's open it up and you see the
way<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.800> cases<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.030> box<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.020> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
way this cases the box this is just a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.140 
way this cases the box this is just a
nice<00:02:33.260> presentation<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:34.310> open<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.970> way

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
nice presentation you open it up one way

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.750 
nice presentation you open it up one way
and<00:02:35.600> then<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> open<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> next<00:02:36.620> way<00:02:36.770> so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and then you open it up the next way so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.040 
and then you open it up the next way so
let's<00:02:37.970> dump<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.300> out<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.600> see<00:02:38.720> what<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.930> get

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
let's dump this out and see what you get

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.910 
let's dump this out and see what you get
inside<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.470> box<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> case<00:02:42.110> itself<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.740> can

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
inside the box now the case itself I can

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.590 
inside the box now the case itself I can
already<00:02:43.100> tell<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.670> feels<00:02:44.180> super<00:02:44.780> sturdy

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
already tell you it feels super sturdy

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.510 
already tell you it feels super sturdy
you<00:02:47.600> know<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.870> feels<00:02:48.020> like<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.920> feels<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.370> you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
you know it feels like it feels like you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.040 
you know it feels like it feels like you
could<00:02:49.640> drop<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.970> out<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.270> moving<00:02:50.570> car<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
could drop this out of a moving car and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.310 
could drop this out of a moving car and
have<00:02:51.380> no<00:02:51.590> problems<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.840> let's<00:02:54.020> see<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.230> we

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
have no problems so let's see if we

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.480 
have no problems so let's see if we
could<00:02:54.470> figure<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.709> how<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.950> open<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.310> up

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
could figure out how to open this up

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.000 
could figure out how to open this up
that's<00:02:56.090> gonna<00:02:56.270> be<00:02:56.480> your<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.470> already<00:02:57.680> screw

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that's gonna be your is it already screw

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.350 
that's gonna be your is it already screw
it<00:02:58.070> in<00:02:58.160> uh<00:02:58.280> everything<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.850> already<00:02:59.030> screwed

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
it in uh everything is already screwed

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.020 
it in uh everything is already screwed
in<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> think<00:03:00.380> I'm<00:03:00.590> gonna<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.070> pop<00:03:01.850> out

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
in so I think I'm gonna have to pop out

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.690 
in so I think I'm gonna have to pop out
the<00:03:02.060> inside<00:03:02.150> first<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.020> um<00:03:03.770> take<00:03:04.340> out<00:03:04.490> all<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
the inside first and um take out all the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.910 
the inside first and um take out all the
stuff<00:03:04.970> let<00:03:05.480> me<00:03:05.570> move<00:03:05.690> back<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> minute<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
stuff let me move back for a minute and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
stuff let me move back for a minute and
see<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.370> open<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.670> up

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.010 

because<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.060> pretty<00:03:15.180> sure<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.540> screwdriver

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
because I'm pretty sure the screwdriver

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.260 
because I'm pretty sure the screwdriver
and<00:03:16.200> everything<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.650> underneath<00:03:17.010> here<00:03:20.270> okay

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
and everything is underneath here okay

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.230 
and everything is underneath here okay

we're gonna get it to detect extreme in
a<00:05:49.300> few<00:05:49.480> minutes<00:05:49.810> but<00:05:50.380> um<00:05:50.620> fellas<00:05:51.460> trust<00:05:51.760> me
