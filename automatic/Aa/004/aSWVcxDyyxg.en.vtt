00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
the fan together and the first part is

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.810 
the fan together and the first part is
commonly<00:00:56.660> found<00:00:56.960> somewhere<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:58.430> room<00:00:58.670> right

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
again open this one back up and just

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.980 
again open this one back up and just
beside<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> tractor<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.510> should<00:03:15.720> find<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
beside the tractor we should find the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.020 
beside the tractor we should find the
second<00:03:16.320> part<00:03:16.530> which<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.190> actually<00:03:17.490> at<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> top

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
second part which is actually at the top

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.630 
second part which is actually at the top
of<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> bus<00:03:18.360> or<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.020> top<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> diner<00:03:19.740> as<00:03:20.040> we

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
of the bus or the top of the diner as we

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.320 
of the bus or the top of the diner as we
also<00:03:21.000> put<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.870> one<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.200> previous<00:03:22.709> videos

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
also put in one of the previous videos

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.520 
also put in one of the previous videos
so<00:03:24.330> we're<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.630> jump<00:03:24.780> back<00:03:24.959> onto<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.380> bus

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so we're going to jump back onto the bus

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.800 
so we're going to jump back onto the bus
and<00:03:25.800> we're<00:03:26.040> going<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.190> travel<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.000> fourth

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and we're going to travel to the fourth

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.780 
and we're going to travel to the fourth
location<00:03:28.110> which<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.830> actually<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.459> fifth

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
location which is actually the fifth

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.350 
location which is actually the fifth
stop<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.959> bus<00:03:31.140> stop<00:03:31.410> set<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.209> is

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
stop the the bus stop set and that is

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
stop the the bus stop set and that is
the<00:03:33.600> town<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.170> believe<00:03:34.350> it's<00:03:34.500> actually<00:03:34.769> called

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
the town I believe it's actually called

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150 
the town I believe it's actually called
the<00:03:35.070> town<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.900> some<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.530> will<00:03:37.950> actually

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
the town so this some this will actually

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.979 
the town so this some this will actually
allow<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.910> ability<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.269> climb<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
allow you the ability to climb up on the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.770 
allow you the ability to climb up on the
roof<00:03:40.140> too<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> anyway<00:03:42.209> we're<00:03:42.390> going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.600> come

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
roof too so anyway we're going to come

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
front of the bus which is what I believe

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.070 
front of the bus which is what I believe
to<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.739> called<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.190> RAM<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.730> now<00:04:06.690> we're<00:04:06.989> going

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
to be called the RAM and now we're going

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.320 
to be called the RAM and now we're going
to<00:04:07.140> go<00:04:07.350> put<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.620> onto<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.820> front<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.209> bus

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
to go put it onto the front of the bus

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.479 
to go put it onto the front of the bus
and<00:04:09.630> hopefully<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.560> should<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:11.220> should<00:04:11.250> get
