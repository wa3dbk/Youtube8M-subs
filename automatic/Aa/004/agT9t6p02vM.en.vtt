 Hi there, UTB drugs today with us 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 mod that will allow us to make robots 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
 and manage them so let's 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.699
 let's get started first we will need 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.699
 craft it yourself the details of the robot is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 hands, legs, and cases, they craft as follows 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 in a way 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.449
 take it means the iron is about to be general 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.090
 here are all the resources you need to craft 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.600
 a robot and so I didnâ€™t set a little 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.420
 need here means gold here here is iron 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.129
 and here we take it right away we have two hands 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.149
 of our robot now we take it like this 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:52.260
 three iron bars and two gold bars 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:56.300
 this is not this is not this is this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 we have two legs 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.149
 next we have this one here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.900

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.490
 arrange the rest of the resources 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.630
 here it turns out here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.560
 torso she is the most expensive then 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.530
 we make the type of guns they craft here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.650
 in this way 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.110
 and here's the stove and the latest we need 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.369
 I forgot to put it here emeralds 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.180
 so so so so so go where they are 4 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.979

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:51.170
 we need a pumpkin 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:53.180
 way and we get the type of head so 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.149
 now we collect all this means 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.229
 torso here guns damn we needed 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.810
 two cannons we make sorry 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.210
 one gun 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.750
 here and now we are collecting the robot itself 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.429
 started things in the center of the gun right here 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 here are the hands on the sides 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.959
 legs are also gods and the head is right here and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.989
 here we get our robot so now 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.650
 let's go and test it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.670
 the street 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.750
 I put the robot and the forehead here is such 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 the robot itself is very kill epic looks on 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.290
 lab background and here we press right 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.320
 mouse button i sit him 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.130
 I go forward and but it does not move me 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.040
 it's all because robots need some 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.160
 fuel so therefore i press the left 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.950
 shift button and my right mouse button 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.260
 Here is such an inventory 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.560
 our robot and boots 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.100
 yes damn what these words constantly 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 from somewhere on this map 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.650
 I apologize so I go back to 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.140
 inventory and put 1 coal and here it is 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.829
 I start working I smoke at him 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.530
 I sit down and calmly can already move 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's how epic god looks cool 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.019
 so now with the English button I press 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.769
 clamping 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.110
 and that's how a laser appears 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.069
 fiery he sets everything on fire 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.629
 Mobs for 3 units of damage Bolin 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.400
 Now there is a zombie here and that's what 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.989
 you can still say if you are allowed in 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.050
 a pig or a cow 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.480
 naturally and the meat we have already waited 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.480
 well toasted will be like this now 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.349
 so come on pig by the way the sides are not a robot 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.910
 can walk 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:05.379
 here he is also jumping but true 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.500
 can not accelerate 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.660
 let's say we will shoot sand 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.620
 the sand will turn immediately to glass 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.250
 this very 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.419
 cool so then the b key 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.510
 English, we like so here 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.870
 park it then take exactly on the block 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.580
 became and no matter how I managed it 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.520
 will only need to move 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.440
 by the way come back and see now 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.940
 on fuel 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.810
 see how much time it has been so far 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.780
 since one google 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.350
 burning that is very much 1 coal 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.389
 for a long time but this is all this only 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.479
 there is one kind of robot here and the second 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.630
 he is such a white craft here i am 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.910
 so here's a show how cheaper it is but by 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.650
 characteristics are exactly the same 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.940
 by the way forgot to say that the robot too 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.360
 there is life is 20 pieces well 20 units 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:05.560
 also this one has 20 units exactly like 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.150
 he just needs fuel too 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.009
 will just as well walk everything set on fire and 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.889
 in such 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:22.319
 spirits here let's put it apply 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.159
 this damage, as you can see, by the way, look 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.710
 notice 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.899
 he sees as if to smoke 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.520
 starts and all broke and in theory should 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.740
 were 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.629
 now i get up he should have 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.479
 crumble see see it begin here 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.309
 In general, all parts remain well, just 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.430
 because there is fire and not all 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:47.039
 survived here I say now 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.620
 Sword break this here you see 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.759
 absolutely all the details are back so 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.300
 he can be told to you as immortal 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:06:00.330
 so well and now we will test our robot 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.539
 night conditions fighting monsters and more 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.639
 I wanted to get off like that 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.009
 Now I do not know why this is here 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.959
 from here let's pull this one out 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:16.110
 laser like 

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:18.909
 he doesn't work anyway 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.129
 he stops working without it 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.469
 laser 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:26.349
 before you put the laser 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.749
 well head it back and here it starts 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:33.099
 go with her I do not know what it is for 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:35.739
 thought up okay turn on the night let's 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:40.059
 zombie zombie go where you are with you creeper 

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:43.749
 and by the way if you fall from a height then 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:45.639
 the character will perish too and 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.389
 and the robot will die and the character will die 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:53.379
 In short, you will die so well, but 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:55.739
 Archer Comrade on vape 3 shoots 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.739

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.690
 all well in general on this whole mod 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.940
