00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Halli hello you love today I show 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.029
 you how to do a nail polish routine 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 looks and I have you now 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.269
 already painted with a paint 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.150
 remove one is now from ivana with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.520
 to change the fragrance and yes everything you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
 still needs a favorite paint the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 you like and use this here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.320
 i just want to have p2 happy now 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 wide and then the p2 online uv 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 it is natural for daylight 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.829
 and the uv lamp needs a nail file 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 her still to get the nails in shape 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 and of course a uv lamp is main 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.420
 now from jolly so i start with that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.770
 File my nails and then start with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 the light of base code the steckborn 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 that is how such a defeat she was the one 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 is quick drying and we 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 simply as a basis so to speak for the p2p 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.619
 Frauenhandel jacket and wear this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 just put a thin layer on it 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.010
 I also want to recommend you the relative 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.540
 to do properly because you have yes 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.370
 also just a few days rest of it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.570
 or even a few days 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.340
 I work a lot with water because of that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.010
 that keeps me with such a week I think 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.510
 times when you do not have so much water in 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.460
 The connection will last even longer 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.590
 take therefore quietly gives you the time 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:30.610
 you trouble because you have a long time 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:32.560
 of that and then you have the first one 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 paint applied then it goes off in the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.520
 uv lamp makes sure that her hand 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.530
 very pure pushes in the uv lamp that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 is very important and the whole leave 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.150
 now 90 seconds out 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.460
 The whole thing looks pretty nice now 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.290
 for me that shines nice but is 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.060
 far from finished now comes the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.950
 Desired lane you want 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.430
 I have chosen my assets from the p2 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.490
 value los and the color number 0 60 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.490
 happy that now carries as normal as 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.229
 had on you can do it twice 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.550
 I always like to do it twice 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.140
 it's easy to cover there and so on 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.790
 It is a bit thicker I like it completely 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 with pleasure 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.910
 and yes 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 and again, of course 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.620
 neat and clean her the whole 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.860
 order the more beautiful it is 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.860
 end result 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.310
 there is also history for the whole story 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.870
 colored p2 uv lacquer the actually for it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.209
 I think I'm here now 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.670
 normal p2 stomach was working that way 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.220
 just as good for me as I have mega 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.079
 a lot at home and then found it nonsensical 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.079
 to buy an additional one 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.489
 as soon as the colored varnish is applied 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.260
 He lets it dry a bit 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.000
 can it also briefly under the uv lamp 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920
 make and then goes on quite well 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.750
 Just try it out if that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.840
 Dried through, you take the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.819
 second was the uv long and gives him 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.069
 just over it in a thin one 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.560
 layer but also here neat 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.209
 work as with the other paints too 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.590
 and if you did that , it works 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.590
 again or deep v lamp 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.700
 so the whole is also chris daylight 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.290
 that means you do not need a uv 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.490
 Buy a lamp if you do not have it 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.040
 you can just do it two 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.110
 minutes of daylight then let it dry 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.480
 it is exactly the same result 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.130
 effect and has the same durability i 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.600
 now had a uv lamp and it works 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.600
 just faster and because of that 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.419
 times 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:45.050
 so it means for my nails now 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.969
 again 90 seconds and UV lamp I 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.689
 do that sometimes three times 90 seconds 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.830
 at the end 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.539
 I just have a bit of that 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.039
 you can do that even better here 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.900
 Let's see, I hope that a result 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.310
 Like you and see you at 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.150
 next makes again sends her 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.150
 love bye
