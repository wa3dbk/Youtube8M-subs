example<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> vanilla<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.619> you're<00:01:43.860> just

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
example in the vanilla if you're just

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
example in the vanilla if you're just
walking<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> trying<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> sprint<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
walking and trying to sprint but you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
walking and trying to sprint but you
like<00:01:47.159> somehow<00:01:47.460> double<00:01:48.030> tap<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> wrong<00:01:48.600> way

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like somehow double tap in the wrong way

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
like somehow double tap in the wrong way
you'll<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.740> hiccup<00:01:50.250> animation

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you'll get this little hiccup animation

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
you'll get this little hiccup animation
you're<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you're like so like this now this is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.649 
you're like so like this now this is
just<00:01:52.950> me<00:01:53.220> spamming<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.970> shift<00:01:54.270> button<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
just me spamming this shift button but

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.569 
just me spamming this shift button but
you<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.149> probably<00:01:57.450> seen<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.869> type<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
you you have probably seen this type of

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.859 
you you have probably seen this type of
annoyance<00:01:59.579> when<00:01:59.850> you're<00:02:00.000> sprinting<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.689> have

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
annoyance when you're sprinting you have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.980 
annoyance when you're sprinting you have
like<00:02:01.079> half<00:02:01.890> sprint<00:02:02.310> stomps<00:02:02.729> has<00:02:03.030> four<00:02:03.420> stop

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
like half sprint stomps has four stop

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
like half sprint stomps has four stop
etc<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.130> very<00:02:05.310> annoying<00:02:06.149> but

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
etc and it's just very annoying but

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.940 
etc and it's just very annoying but
basically<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.290> mod<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
basically with this mod all you have the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
basically with this mod all you have the
dish's<00:02:08.220> hold<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> certain<00:02:08.670> button<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> can

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
dish's hold a certain button and you can

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.900 
dish's hold a certain button and you can
sprint<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.739> long<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.310> want

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
sprint for as long as you want

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.730 
sprint for as long as you want
but<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.270> course<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.140> model<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> also

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
but of course this model is also

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880 
but of course this model is also
compatible<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:15.260> multiplayer<00:02:16.260> because

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
compatible with multiplayer because

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
compatible with multiplayer because
technically<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> doesn't<00:02:17.820> really<00:02:17.940> affect

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
technically it doesn't really affect

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.070 
technically it doesn't really affect
anything<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.650> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.070> does<00:02:20.720> change<00:02:21.720> how

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
anything but it kind of does change how

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.220 
anything but it kind of does change how
your<00:02:22.500> sprinting<00:02:23.280> mechanics<00:02:23.310> work<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.690> we're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
your sprinting mechanics work so we're

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
your sprinting mechanics work so we're
gonna<00:02:25.320> go<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> multiplayer<00:02:25.980> right<00:02:26.370> about<00:02:26.580> now

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
gonna go to multiplayer right about now

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.940 
gonna go to multiplayer right about now
and<00:02:27.150> I'm<00:02:28.020> gonna<00:02:28.140> show<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> guys<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and I'm gonna show you guys in a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.780 
and I'm gonna show you guys in a
sleeping<00:02:29.370> match<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.420> still<00:02:30.840> works<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.790> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
sleeping match how it still works and I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.370 
sleeping match how it still works and I
guess<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.180> could<00:02:33.300> give<00:02:33.540> yourself<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:34.050> slight

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
guess you could give yourself a slight

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.500 
guess you could give yourself a slight
advantage<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.250> still<00:02:35.790> require<00:02:36.180> skill

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
advantage but it's still require skill

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.660 
advantage but it's still require skill
to<00:02:36.720> do<00:02:36.840> solution<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:37.740> okay<00:02:38.520> guys

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
to do solution so here we go okay guys

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
to do solution so here we go okay guys
so<00:02:38.850> we're<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.060> skip<00:02:39.330> skip<00:02:39.480> server<00:02:39.780> here<00:02:40.080> we're

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
so we're on skip skip server here we're

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.510 
so we're on skip skip server here we're
going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.350> do<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> few<00:02:40.830> rounds<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.280> sleep

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
going to do a few rounds of sleep

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.980 
going to do a few rounds of sleep
actually<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.210> whereas<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.720> should<00:02:42.900> do

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
actually just one whereas we should do

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.780 
actually just one whereas we should do
and<00:02:43.260> basically<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:44.070> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:44.370> testing

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
and basically I'm going to be testing

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.350 
and basically I'm going to be testing
out<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.270> sprinting<00:02:45.870> mod<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.370> gameplay<00:02:48.210> of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720 
out the sprinting mod with a gameplay of
sleep<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:49.380> many<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.770> probably<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.610> know
