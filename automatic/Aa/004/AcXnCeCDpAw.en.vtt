what's up guys this is Black Knight and

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.370 
what's up guys this is Black Knight and
I'm<00:00:05.200> going<00:00:05.560> to<00:00:05.649> show<00:00:05.770> you<00:00:06.040> how<00:00:06.189> to<00:00:06.430> make<00:00:06.670> a

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.690 
I'm going to show you how to make a
fusion<00:00:08.380> bomb<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.940> life<00:00:10.780> support<00:00:11.549> first<00:00:12.549> you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
fusion bomb with life support first you

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.440 
fusion bomb with life support first you
want<00:00:12.849> to<00:00:12.879> go<00:00:12.969> to<00:00:13.030> generators<00:00:15.360> select<00:00:16.360> your

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
want to go to generators select your

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.310 
want to go to generators select your
fusion<00:00:16.930> generator<00:00:18.540> you<00:00:19.540> don't<00:00:19.690> want<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> spawn

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
fusion generator you don't want to spawn

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.620 
fusion generator you don't want to spawn
a<00:00:20.350> couple<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:20.980> them<00:00:21.100> depends<00:00:21.880> on<00:00:21.940> how<00:00:22.060> fast<00:00:22.330> you

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
a couple of them depends on how fast you

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.680 
a couple of them depends on how fast you
want<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.900> get<00:00:23.440> it<00:00:23.560> to<00:00:23.740> generate<00:00:24.450> first<00:00:25.450> one<00:00:25.600> I'm

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
want to get it to generate first one I'm

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.210 
want to get it to generate first one I'm
going<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.840> make<00:00:25.960> it<00:00:26.110> real<00:00:26.350> fast<00:00:26.530> and<00:00:26.800> respond

quite a few now you're going to want to
go<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.969> storage<00:00:43.480> devices<00:00:43.929> and<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:45.670> going

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
go to storage devices and you're going

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.529 
go to storage devices and you're going
to<00:00:45.820> want<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.120> select<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.809> large<00:00:47.530> energy<00:00:48.010> cell

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to want to select the large energy cell

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.799 
to want to select the large energy cell
and<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.739> usually<00:00:51.010> do<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.339> I<00:00:51.640> just<00:00:51.809> surround

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
all right now that everything's turned

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.649 
all right now that everything's turned
on<00:01:54.310> you'll<00:01:55.310> know<00:01:55.460> once<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.789> see<00:01:55.969> puffs<00:01:56.390> of

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
on you'll know once you see puffs of

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.419 
on you'll know once you see puffs of
smoke<00:01:56.689> coming<00:01:57.200> from<00:01:57.350> them<00:01:58.000> and<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:01.009> is<00:02:01.130> where

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
smoke coming from them and this is where

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.559 
smoke coming from them and this is where
the<00:02:01.490> part<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.909> takes<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.209> little<00:02:02.329> while

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
the part that takes a little while

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.080 
the part that takes a little while
you're<00:02:03.020> going<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.439> want<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.590> sit<00:02:03.799> back<00:02:04.090> watch

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
you're going to want to sit back watch

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.930 
you're going to want to sit back watch
your<00:02:05.149> energy<00:02:05.689> rise<00:02:06.340> amazingly<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:09.940> that's

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
your energy rise amazingly so that's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.479 
your energy rise amazingly so that's
going<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.239> rise<00:02:12.280> by<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.660> point<00:02:15.049> of<00:02:16.269> 100,000<00:02:17.269> is

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
going to rise by the point of 100,000 is

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.300 
going to rise by the point of 100,000 is
when<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.730> gets<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:21.500> alarms<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.069> start

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
when it gets to the alarms will start

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.910 
when it gets to the alarms will start
going<00:02:22.549> off<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.620> everything<00:02:24.620> will<00:02:24.739> start

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
going off and everything will start

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.770 
going off and everything will start
blowing<00:02:25.370> up<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:26.000> let's<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.329> ahead<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.599> move

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
blowing up so let's go ahead and move

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.970 
blowing up so let's go ahead and move
back<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.019> little<00:02:28.780> go<00:02:29.780> ahead<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.110> wait<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.770 

see<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.519> were<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> have<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.209> three<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.599> them

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
see if I were to have like three of them

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.530 
see if I were to have like three of them
this<00:02:35.959> would<00:02:36.110> take<00:02:36.349> like<00:02:36.879> rather<00:02:37.879> long<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> now

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
this would take like rather long so now

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.349 
this would take like rather long so now
195<00:02:41.859> 7<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:43.069> 8<00:02:43.250> not<00:02:43.790> all<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.090> now<00:02:44.209> we're

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
195 7 and 8 not all right now we're

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:55.710 
195 7 and 8 not all right now we're
moved<00:02:44.540> back<00:02:49.810> right

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.820 

alright<00:02:56.720> yeah<00:02:56.960> see<00:02:57.290> how<00:02:57.350> they're<00:02:57.380> starting<00:02:57.800> to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
alright yeah see how they're starting to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.010 
alright yeah see how they're starting to
turn<00:02:57.980> gray<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:59.540> start<00:02:59.810> seeing

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
turn gray and the you start seeing

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.870 
turn gray and the you start seeing
sparks<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.770> means<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.220> alarms<00:03:01.550> going<00:03:01.760> off

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
sparks that means the alarms going off

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.370 
sparks that means the alarms going off
and<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:03.710> can<00:03:03.800> hit<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.850> yeah<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.720> has<00:03:08.870> zoom<00:03:09.230> out

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
some of these left over a little bit of

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.670 
some of these left over a little bit of
energy<00:05:18.060> for<00:05:18.300> your<00:05:18.419> ship<00:05:19.080> when<00:05:19.349> you're<00:05:19.470> done

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680

after blowing up people's stuff on earth
if<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:25.139> server<00:05:25.409> survives<00:05:26.039> somehow<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:28.849> that

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
if the server survives somehow so that

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.990 
if the server survives somehow so that
was<00:05:30.000> my<00:05:30.030> tutorial<00:05:30.599> on<00:05:30.720> how<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.900> make<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:32.159> fusion

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
was my tutorial on how to make a fusion

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.350 
was my tutorial on how to make a fusion
bomb<00:05:33.210> with<00:05:33.509> life<00:05:33.810> support<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:35.120> hope<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.300> all

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
bomb with life support I hope you all

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.089 
bomb with life support I hope you all
learned<00:05:36.599> it<00:05:36.990> from<00:05:37.199> this<00:05:37.789> and<00:05:39.229> go<00:05:40.229> fuck<00:05:40.860> up

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
learned it from this and go fuck up

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.090 
learned it from this and go fuck up
servers<00:05:41.580> have<00:05:41.819> fun
