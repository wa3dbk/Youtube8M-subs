invention and I always thought that I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
invention and I always thought that I
would<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> million-dollar<00:00:44.340> lab<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> make

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
would need a million-dollar lab to make

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
would need a million-dollar lab to make
it<00:00:45.120> happen<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.719> need<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> few<00:00:46.230> people<00:00:46.559> you

it happen we just need a few people you
all<00:00:46.890> chip<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.430> pay<00:00:47.579> rent<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
all chip in you pay rent and then you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
all chip in you pay rent and then you
buy<00:00:48.780> cool<00:00:49.079> tools<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> fall<00:00:49.860> share<00:00:50.129> the

get in a college experience where people

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
get in a college experience where people
are<00:01:02.370> making<00:01:02.520> side<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.210> side<00:01:03.510> even<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.470> things

are making side by side even when things
are<00:01:04.799> unrelated<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.290> of

wireless mesh network

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.350 
wireless mesh network
it'll<00:01:21.890> gently<00:01:22.220> attached<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.789> their<00:01:23.180> head

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
it'll gently attached it to their head

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080 
it'll gently attached it to their head
and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:24.110> they'll<00:01:24.289> be<00:01:24.409> guided<00:01:24.829> by<00:01:24.860> two<00:01:25.759> motors

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then they'll be guided by two motors

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.749 
and then they'll be guided by two motors
on<00:01:26.299> one<00:01:26.450> on<00:01:26.539> each<00:01:26.659> side<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.679> fly<00:01:27.920> around<00:01:28.100> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
on one on each side to fly around and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.649 
on one on each side to fly around and
and<00:01:29.270> distribute<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.049> wireless<00:01:30.740> network

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
and distribute the wireless network

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.660 
and distribute the wireless network
equally<00:01:32.659> through<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:32.960> mesh<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:34.069> have<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> robotic

which<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.769> RepRap<00:02:34.130> means<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.209> these<00:02:35.389> this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
which is what RepRap means so these this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.020 
which is what RepRap means so these this
is<00:02:35.959> actually<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> part<00:02:36.889> to<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.459> nozzle<00:02:37.819> that

is actually a part to the nozzle that

is actually a part to the nozzle that
was<00:02:38.569> printed<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.350> printer<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:41.120> itself<00:02:41.540> and

was printed on a printer of itself and
for<00:02:43.010> instance<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.670> connect<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.600> pieces

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
for instance you can connect the pieces

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.530 
for instance you can connect the pieces
with<00:02:45.200> nuts<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.859> bolts<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.340> make<00:02:47.030> whole

months<00:02:55.250> or<00:02:55.430> years<00:02:55.639> later<00:02:55.880> they're<00:02:56.870> there<00:02:57.200> now

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
months or years later they're there now

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.460 
months or years later they're there now
to<00:02:58.819> be<00:02:58.940> saving<00:02:59.150> funding<00:02:59.630> for<00:02:59.870> new<00:02:59.989> projects

bigger<00:03:02.569> spaces<00:03:02.959> where<00:03:03.440> they've<00:03:03.590> started

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
bigger spaces where they've started

bigger spaces where they've started
their<00:03:04.010> own<00:03:04.069> company<00:03:04.609> three<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.090> them

their own company three of them
people<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.800> also<00:03:06.980> started<00:03:07.820> their<00:03:08.000> own

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
people have also started their own

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.810 
people have also started their own
manufacturing<00:03:08.420> companies<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.400> consider

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
manufacturing companies so we consider

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.720 
manufacturing companies so we consider
those<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.120> successes
