00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.420 

theme<00:05:45.710> okay<00:05:46.490> this<00:05:46.699> one's<00:05:47.000> another<00:05:47.270> katadyn

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
theme okay this one's another katadyn

theme okay this one's another katadyn
and<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.520> think<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:49.729> planted<00:05:50.090> two<00:05:50.240> in<00:05:50.360> there

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
and I think you planted two in there

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:58.990 
and I think you planted two in there
right<00:05:57.099> that's<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.340> way<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.490> do<00:05:58.699> it

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
right that's the way to do it
