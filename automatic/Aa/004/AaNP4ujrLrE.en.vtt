that<00:01:48.680> when<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.190> shoot<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.430> bow<00:01:49.640> heart

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that when you shoot a bow heart

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.480 
that when you shoot a bow heart
particles<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.050> follow<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.409> arrow<00:01:51.590> makes<00:01:52.370> it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
particles to follow the arrow makes it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.370 
particles to follow the arrow makes it
really<00:01:52.610> nice<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.030> tell<00:01:53.240> where<00:01:53.720> your<00:01:53.900> era<00:01:54.140> was

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
really nice to tell where your era was

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.060 
really nice to tell where your era was
going<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.659> an<00:01:56.840> added<00:01:57.290> fun<00:01:57.500> feature<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.980> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
going so as an added fun feature in the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.649 
going so as an added fun feature in the
texture<00:01:58.370> pack<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.730> changed<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> texture<00:01:59.570> of

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
texture pack I changed the texture of

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.170 
texture pack I changed the texture of
the<00:01:59.960> poppy<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.500> arose<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.430> break<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.820> Rose

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
the poppy to arose if I break this Rose

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.690 
the poppy to arose if I break this Rose
here<00:02:02.450> you'll<00:02:02.630> see<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.260> now<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> rose

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
here you'll see that it is now a rose

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
here you'll see that it is now a rose
instead<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.780> poppy<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.530> now<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:07.040> lot<00:02:07.220> of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
instead of a poppy so now I a lot of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580 
instead of a poppy so now I a lot of
people<00:02:07.430> know<00:02:07.580> me<00:02:07.880> for<00:02:08.090> my<00:02:08.390> love<00:02:09.019> for<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> rose

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
people know me for my love for the rose

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.190 
people know me for my love for the rose
so<00:02:10.159> I<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.429> brought<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.729> back<00:02:11.060> into<00:02:11.330> 1.7<00:02:12.079> and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so I have brought that back into 1.7 and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.059 
so I have brought that back into 1.7 and
it's<00:02:12.739> pretty<00:02:13.069> fun<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.489> look<00:02:13.609> at

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it's pretty fun to look at

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.860 
it's pretty fun to look at
so<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.609> the<00:02:15.670> last<00:02:15.879> things<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> edited

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
so one of the last things that I edited

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.720 
so one of the last things that I edited
was<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.349> fire<00:02:17.739> now<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.040> fire<00:02:18.249> is<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.579> only

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
was the fire now the fire is the only

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.119 
was the fire now the fire is the only
thing<00:02:18.999> that<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.269> not<00:02:19.450> 16<00:02:20.079> by<00:02:20.260> 16<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:21.010> this

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
thing that is not 16 by 16 in this

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.890 
thing that is not 16 by 16 in this
texture<00:02:21.519> pack<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.879> is<00:02:22.389> pretty<00:02:22.689> high

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
texture pack it is pretty high

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.470 
texture pack it is pretty high
resolution<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.099> looks<00:02:24.310> very<00:02:24.400> nice<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.150> if

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
resolution but it looks very nice and if

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.000 
resolution but it looks very nice and if
I<00:02:25.540> put<00:02:25.749> fire<00:02:25.959> down<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.260> you'll<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.889> it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I put fire down here you'll see that it

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.739 
I put fire down here you'll see that it
is<00:02:27.040> pretty<00:02:27.609> low<00:02:27.969> so<00:02:28.329> it's<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.689> that

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:28.749 
is pretty low so it's not that

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.080 
is pretty low so it's not that
distracting<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:29.889> it's<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.159> that<00:02:30.370> tall<00:02:30.730> as

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
distracting and it's not that tall as

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.050 
distracting and it's not that tall as
the<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.590> fire<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.189> default<00:02:33.579> texture<00:02:33.879> pack

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the the fire in the default texture pack

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.729 
the the fire in the default texture pack
so<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.359> really<00:02:34.480> nice<00:02:34.659> and<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.530> get

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
so it's really nice and when you get

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.740 
so it's really nice and when you get
caught<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.189> fire<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.700> hardly<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.450> your<00:02:37.569> face

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
caught on fire it's hardly in your face

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.479 
caught on fire it's hardly in your face
at<00:02:37.989> all<00:02:38.109> you<00:02:38.379> probably<00:02:38.650> don't<00:02:38.859> even<00:02:38.980> notice<00:02:39.250> it

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
at all you probably don't even notice it

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.909 
at all you probably don't even notice it
at<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.670> moment<00:02:39.819> oh<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:41.530> kind<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.799> just

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:41.919 
at the moment oh it kind of just

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.089 
at the moment oh it kind of just
disappeared<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.549> let's<00:02:43.239> do<00:02:43.419> that<00:02:43.540> again<00:02:44.099> but

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
disappeared but let's do that again but

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.000 
disappeared but let's do that again but
yes<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.639> the<00:02:45.669> fire<00:02:45.939> particles<00:02:46.419> and<00:02:47.010> it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
yes this is the fire particles and it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250 
yes this is the fire particles and it
looks<00:02:48.609> really<00:02:48.849> nice<00:02:48.969> so<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.269> like<00:02:49.659> that<00:02:49.989> because

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
looks really nice so I like that because

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.530 
looks really nice so I like that because
now<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.859> fight<00:02:51.579> people<00:02:51.909> when<00:02:52.060> i'm<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.329> fire

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
now I can fight people when i'm on fire

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.379 
now I can fight people when i'm on fire
and<00:02:52.810> not<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.169> to<00:02:53.290> worry<00:02:53.319> about<00:02:53.620> oh<00:02:54.180> my<00:02:55.180> gosh

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
and not have to worry about oh my gosh

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.509 
and not have to worry about oh my gosh
where<00:02:55.780> are<00:02:56.019> they<00:02:56.230> am<00:02:56.379> on<00:02:56.709> fire<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.219> i<00:02:57.310> can't

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
where are they am on fire and i can't

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.580 
where are they am on fire and i can't
see<00:02:57.730> anything<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.449> that's<00:02:59.139> what<00:02:59.319> i<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.409> about

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
see anything so that's what i like about

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.280 
see anything so that's what i like about
the<00:02:59.919> fire<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.269> some<00:03:01.449> texture<00:03:01.780> packs<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.199> can

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the fire so in some texture packs it can

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.839 
the fire so in some texture packs it can
be<00:03:02.379> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.620> hard<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.859> tell<00:03:03.099> when<00:03:03.340> somebody<00:03:03.730> is

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
be kind of hard to tell when somebody is

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.119 
be kind of hard to tell when somebody is
using<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.329> golden<00:03:04.659> apple<00:03:04.750> with<00:03:05.620> my<00:03:05.769> texture

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
using a golden apple with my texture

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.729 
using a golden apple with my texture
pack<00:03:06.280> if<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.969> eat<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> golden<00:03:07.510> apple<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:08.530> get

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
pack if you eat a golden apple you get

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.069 
pack if you eat a golden apple you get
nice<00:03:08.980> blue<00:03:09.340> particles<00:03:09.849> around<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.389> this

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
nice blue particles around you this

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.050 
nice blue particles around you this
makes<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.439> very<00:03:11.500> easy<00:03:11.889> to<00:03:12.250> tell<00:03:12.579> when<00:03:12.730> somebody

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
makes it very easy to tell when somebody

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.050 
makes it very easy to tell when somebody
uses<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> golden<00:03:13.870> apple<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.639> lot<00:03:15.909> more

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
uses a golden apple and is a lot more

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.599 
uses a golden apple and is a lot more
visible<00:03:16.510> than<00:03:16.569> most<00:03:16.930> texture<00:03:17.290> packs<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.489> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
visible than most texture packs so the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.159 
visible than most texture packs so the
last<00:03:18.760> thing<00:03:18.879> I<00:03:19.030> want<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.269> cover<00:03:19.329> my<00:03:19.720> text<00:03:19.989> pack

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
last thing I want to cover my text pack

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.679 
last thing I want to cover my text pack
is<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.590> font<00:03:20.919> no<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> font<00:03:21.639> hasn't<00:03:22.389> changed

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
is the font no the font hasn't changed

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.349 
is the font no the font hasn't changed
that<00:03:22.780> much<00:03:23.069> but<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.189> makes<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.669> text<00:03:25.030> look<00:03:25.239> a

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
that much but it makes the text look a

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.629 
that much but it makes the text look a
lot<00:03:25.599> more<00:03:25.659> smooth<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:26.859> say<00:03:27.040> hello<00:03:27.430> and

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
lot more smooth so if I say hello and

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.229 
lot more smooth so if I say hello and
Chet<00:03:27.909> you'll<00:03:28.449> see<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.979> a<00:03:30.849> little<00:03:31.090> bit

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
Chet you'll see that it is a little bit

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.390 
Chet you'll see that it is a little bit
more<00:03:31.389> smooth<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.900> less<00:03:32.169> pixelated<00:03:32.919> so<00:03:33.129> it's<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
more smooth and less pixelated so it's a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.849 
more smooth and less pixelated so it's a
lot<00:03:33.549> nicer<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:34.180> look<00:03:34.209> at<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> lot

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
lot nicer to look at and I like it a lot

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.479 
lot nicer to look at and I like it a lot
so<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.819> no<00:03:37.060> use<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.109> square<00:03:38.590> font<00:03:38.919> for<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.280> while

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
so I no use that square font for a while

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.149 
so I no use that square font for a while
and<00:03:39.810> some<00:03:40.810> people<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.259> that<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.709> if<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:41.919> want

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
and some people like that so if you want

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.469 
and some people like that so if you want
that<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.669> go<00:03:42.759> check<00:03:42.939> out<00:03:43.060> link<00:03:43.299> do

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
that you have to go check out link do

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.860 
that you have to go check out link do
1997's<00:03:44.409> texture<00:03:45.099> pack<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:46.629> always

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
1997's texture pack as it's always

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.390 
1997's texture pack as it's always
channel<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.590> watch<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.949> texture<00:03:48.280> pack

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
channel so go watch this texture pack

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.189 
channel so go watch this texture pack
video<00:03:48.699> and<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.449> going<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.659> be<00:03:49.780> right<00:03:50.019> there

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
video and it's going to be right there

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.539 
video and it's going to be right there
so<00:03:50.439> I<00:03:50.729> there<00:03:51.729> you<00:03:51.819> go<00:03:51.879> link<00:03:52.150> free<00:03:52.359> advertising

so<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.699> good<00:03:54.790> thing<00:03:54.849> about<00:03:55.030> my<00:03:55.359> texture<00:03:55.689> pack

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
so the good thing about my texture pack

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.360 
so the good thing about my texture pack
is<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.169> you're<00:03:56.319> able<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.799> combine<00:03:57.009> it<00:03:57.340> with

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
is that you're able to combine it with

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.520 
is that you're able to combine it with
different<00:03:57.669> texture<00:03:58.239> packs<00:03:58.449> in<00:03:58.659> my<00:03:59.139> texture

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
different texture packs in my texture

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.740 
different texture packs in my texture
pack<00:03:59.739> everything<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.579> pretty<00:04:00.969> much<00:04:01.060> default

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
pack everything is pretty much default

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.140 
pack everything is pretty much default
when<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.439> comes<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.799> items<00:04:03.219> weapons<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
when it comes to the items weapons and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.770 
when it comes to the items weapons and
blocks<00:04:05.069> at<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.250> moment<00:04:06.519> I'm<00:04:06.669> using<00:04:06.939> red<00:04:07.479> craft

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
blocks at the moment I'm using red craft

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.740 
blocks at the moment I'm using red craft
and<00:04:08.019> my<00:04:08.319> texture<00:04:08.739> pack<00:04:08.919> combined<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.150> it

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
and my texture pack combined and it

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.499 
and my texture pack combined and it
looks<00:04:11.049> like<00:04:11.169> this<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.609> swords<00:04:13.060> are<00:04:13.299> from

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:13.509 
looks like this so the swords are from

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.920 
looks like this so the swords are from
red<00:04:13.719> craft<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.500> bow<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.949> from<00:04:15.159> red<00:04:15.340> craft<00:04:15.930> but

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
red craft the bow is from red craft but

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.469 
red craft the bow is from red craft but
some<00:04:17.199> other<00:04:17.409> things<00:04:17.709> like<00:04:17.919> my<00:04:18.219> Rose<00:04:18.519> are<00:04:18.880> still

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
some other things like my Rose are still

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.839 
some other things like my Rose are still
my<00:04:19.690> thing<00:04:19.959> now<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.039> way<00:04:21.159> you<00:04:21.219> do<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.639> he

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
my thing now the way you do this is he

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.180 
my thing now the way you do this is he
going<00:04:22.000> options<00:04:22.509> resource<00:04:23.199> packs<00:04:23.469> and<00:04:23.710> then

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
going options resource packs and then

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.769 
going options resource packs and then
you<00:04:24.340> choose<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.029> text<00:04:25.270> effects<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.630> want

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:25.779 
you choose all the text effects you want

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:26.700 
you choose all the text effects you want
to<00:04:25.840> combine

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
to combine

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.430 
to combine
I'm<00:04:26.770> put<00:04:27.160> them<00:04:27.280> over<00:04:27.340> here<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.930> want<00:04:29.199> to

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
I'm put them over here then you want to

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.490 
I'm put them over here then you want to
choose<00:04:30.190> which<00:04:30.490> ones<00:04:30.789> are<00:04:31.180> more<00:04:31.780> prioritized

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
choose which ones are more prioritized

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.439 
choose which ones are more prioritized
now<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.860> won't<00:04:33.160> love<00:04:33.430> packed<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.970> be<00:04:34.120> more

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
now I won't love packed to be more

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.930 
now I won't love packed to be more
prioritized<00:04:35.110> because<00:04:35.889> i<00:04:35.919> like<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.580> GUI

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
prioritized because i like the GUI

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
prioritized because i like the GUI
system<00:04:37.539> better<00:04:37.720> but<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.650> still<00:04:38.710> want<00:04:39.099> to<00:04:39.130> keep

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
system better but I still want to keep

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.999 
system better but I still want to keep
the<00:04:39.520> weapons<00:04:39.880> from<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.870> red<00:04:41.289> craft<00:04:41.590> texture

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
the weapons from the red craft texture

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.189 
the weapons from the red craft texture
so<00:04:42.280> that's<00:04:42.910> how<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.150> combine<00:04:43.569> textures

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
so that's how you can combine textures

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.490 
so that's how you can combine textures
with<00:04:44.860> 1.7<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:46.569> don't<00:04:46.900> think<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.110> can<00:04:47.199> do<00:04:47.349> this

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
with 1.7 I don't think you can do this

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.150 
with 1.7 I don't think you can do this
with<00:04:47.560> 1.6<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:48.639> oh<00:04:48.849> well<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.770> yeah<00:04:50.949> guys<00:04:51.099> that

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
with 1.6 but oh well so yeah guys that

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.850 
with 1.6 but oh well so yeah guys that
is<00:04:51.430> all<00:04:51.789> I<00:04:51.819> have<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.240> show<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:52.419> um<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:53.740> my
