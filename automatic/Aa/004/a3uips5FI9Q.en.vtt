00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.980 

when<00:00:18.670> we<00:00:18.760> talk<00:00:18.910> about<00:00:18.939> vehicles<00:00:19.630> of<00:00:19.869> the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
when we talk about vehicles of the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.990 
when we talk about vehicles of the
future<00:00:20.380> for<00:00:20.830> many<00:00:21.099> people<00:00:21.490> they<00:00:21.640> immediately

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
future for many people they immediately

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.600 
future for many people they immediately
think<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.390> replacing<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.470> car<00:00:23.740> but<00:00:24.400> in<00:00:24.490> many

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
think of replacing the car but in many

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.130 
think of replacing the car but in many
parts<00:00:24.820> of<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.119> world<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.509> predominant<00:00:25.930> form

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
parts of the world the predominant form

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.650 
parts of the world the predominant form
of<00:00:26.230> transport<00:00:26.619> is<00:00:26.890> actually<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.279> bike<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.090> so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
of transport is actually a bike and so

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.720 
of transport is actually a bike and so
how<00:00:28.899> can<00:00:28.930> we<00:00:29.169> make<00:00:29.200> those<00:00:29.680> better<00:00:30.279> that's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
how can we make those better that's

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.100 
how can we make those better that's
something<00:00:31.059> else<00:00:31.180> that<00:00:31.300> litte<00:00:31.630> Motors<00:00:31.960> is

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
something else that litte Motors is

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.479 
something else that litte Motors is
looking<00:00:32.349> at<00:00:32.470> Ryan<00:00:32.890> you're<00:00:33.040> part<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> team

nice to meet you nice to meet you can
you<00:00:35.110> describe<00:00:35.440> this<00:00:36.040> bike<00:00:36.399> to<00:00:36.640> us<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.910> mean<00:00:37.030> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
you describe this bike to us I mean the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.310 
you describe this bike to us I mean the
first<00:00:37.480> thing<00:00:37.600> that<00:00:37.809> comes<00:00:37.989> out<00:00:38.079> of<00:00:38.230> us

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
first thing that comes out of us

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.740 
first thing that comes out of us
immediately<00:00:38.920> on<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.340> design<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.820> this<00:00:40.059> open

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
immediately on the design is this open

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.380 
immediately on the design is this open
space<00:00:40.989> here<00:00:41.020> yeah<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:42.460> optimized<00:00:42.820> this<00:00:43.090> for

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
space here yeah so we optimized this for

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.690 
space here yeah so we optimized this for
cargo<00:00:43.780> carrying<00:00:44.050> you've<00:00:44.649> got<00:00:44.860> about<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.220> 22

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
cargo carrying you've got about a 22

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.670 
cargo carrying you've got about a 22
inch<00:00:46.030> square<00:00:46.390> space<00:00:46.990> right<00:00:47.320> here<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:47.620> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
inch square space right here in the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.230 
inch square space right here in the
middle<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.160> can<00:00:48.280> carry<00:00:48.520> pretty<00:00:49.090> much

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
middle that you can carry pretty much

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.110 
middle that you can carry pretty much
anything<00:00:49.660> it'll<00:00:50.650> carry<00:00:50.890> up<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.280> about<00:00:51.490> 100<00:00:52.030> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
anything it'll carry up to about 100 to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.240 
anything it'll carry up to about 100 to
200<00:00:52.300> pounds<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.960> cargo<00:00:53.320> in<00:00:53.560> addition<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.160> the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
200 pounds of cargo in addition to the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.840 
200 pounds of cargo in addition to the
rider<00:00:55.380> so<00:00:56.380> this<00:00:56.590> when<00:00:57.130> we<00:00:57.220> see<00:00:57.370> those<00:00:57.489> pictures

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
rider so this when we see those pictures

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.360 
rider so this when we see those pictures
of<00:00:58.000> bikes<00:00:58.239> piled<00:00:58.720> high<00:00:59.020> where<00:00:59.530> baskets<00:01:00.220> and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
of bikes piled high where baskets and

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.620 
of bikes piled high where baskets and
goods<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.760> things<00:01:00.880> on<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.120> driver<00:01:01.390> somehow

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
goods and things on the driver somehow

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.030 
goods and things on the driver somehow
perch<00:01:01.930> in<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.079> middle<00:01:02.290> you've<00:01:02.410> tried<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:02.890> turn

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
perch in the middle you've tried to turn

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.740 
perch in the middle you've tried to turn
that<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:03.310> this<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:03.880> its<00:01:04.089> head<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.479> make<00:01:04.629> this

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that on this on its head and make this

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.050 
that on this on its head and make this
more<00:01:05.049> about<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.920> cargo<00:01:06.130> first<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.759> the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
more about the cargo first and the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.330 
more about the cargo first and the
driver<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.450> back<00:01:07.630> here<00:01:07.840> exactly<00:01:08.409> though

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
driver on the back here exactly though

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.039 
driver on the back here exactly though
those<00:01:09.549> drivers<00:01:09.790> are<00:01:10.060> somehow<00:01:10.299> able<00:01:10.689> to

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
those drivers are somehow able to

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.550 
those drivers are somehow able to
navigate<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.560> street<00:01:11.799> safely<00:01:13.229> we're<00:01:14.229> trying

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
navigate the street safely we're trying

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.770 
navigate the street safely we're trying
to<00:01:14.619> make<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.920> even<00:01:15.130> safer<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:16.509> know<00:01:16.540> by

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
to make that even safer you know by

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.179 
to make that even safer you know by
making<00:01:17.109> something<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.499> is<00:01:17.619> specifically

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
making something that is specifically

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.609 
making something that is specifically
geared<00:01:18.520> towards<00:01:18.670> carrying<00:01:19.389> cargo<00:01:19.780> they<00:01:20.439> can

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
geared towards carrying cargo they can

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.249 
geared towards carrying cargo they can
do<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.069> in<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.060> much<00:01:22.179> better<00:01:22.359> way<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:22.810> you

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
do so in a much better way so you

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.770 
do so in a much better way so you
obviously<00:01:23.530> have<00:01:23.679> no<00:01:23.829> engine<00:01:24.249> up<00:01:24.490> here<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.299> how

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
obviously have no engine up here so how

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.620 
obviously have no engine up here so how
do<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.049> drive<00:01:26.499> this<00:01:26.560> bike<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.850> use<00:01:27.939> an<00:01:28.119> N<00:01:28.329> in

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
do you drive this bike so we use an N in

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.219 
do you drive this bike so we use an N in
hub<00:01:28.929> motor<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.859> the<00:01:29.889> motor<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.549> right<00:01:31.090> here<00:01:31.420> in

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
hub motor so the motor is right here in

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.419 
hub motor so the motor is right here in
the<00:01:32.409> center<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.709> the<00:01:32.799> way<00:01:32.889> all<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.130> this

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
the center of the way all this this

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.080 
the center of the way all this this
exactly<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.499> motor<00:01:35.499> itself<00:01:35.889> and<00:01:36.189> so<00:01:36.909> that

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
exactly the motor itself and so that

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.309 
exactly the motor itself and so that
means<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.959> do<00:01:38.049> pretty<00:01:38.200> much

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
means that you can do pretty much

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.629 
means that you can do pretty much
whatever<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.829> want<00:01:39.069> with<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.310> vehicle

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
whatever you want with the vehicle

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.609 
whatever you want with the vehicle
architecture<00:01:40.149> we<00:01:40.689> decided<00:01:41.109> to<00:01:41.170> optimize<00:01:41.590> for

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
architecture we decided to optimize for

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.830 
architecture we decided to optimize for
cargo<00:01:42.369> carrying<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.209> you<00:01:43.299> can<00:01:43.420> see<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.659> large

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
cargo carrying so you can see the large

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.109 
cargo carrying so you can see the large
cargo<00:01:44.200> space<00:01:44.439> there<00:01:44.679> yeah<00:01:45.159> let's<00:01:45.399> focus<00:01:45.789> in<00:01:46.029> on

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
cargo space there yeah let's focus in on

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.669 
cargo space there yeah let's focus in on
this<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:46.479> because<00:01:46.659> this<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.079> key<00:01:47.259> part

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
this then because this is the key part

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.709 
this then because this is the key part
so<00:01:48.039> this<00:01:48.219> actually<00:01:48.639> really<00:01:49.270> gives<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.509> enough

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
so this actually really gives you enough

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.999 
so this actually really gives you enough
space<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:49.959> carry<00:01:50.200> just<00:01:50.499> about<00:01:50.679> anything

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
space to carry just about anything

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.590 
space to carry just about anything
almost<00:01:51.159> people<00:01:51.729> by<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:51.969> looks<00:01:52.179> of<00:01:52.270> things<00:01:52.329> I'd

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
almost people by the looks of things I'd

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.550 
almost people by the looks of things I'd
just<00:01:52.899> about<00:01:52.990> get<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.319> there

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
just about get in there

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.089 
just about get in there
exactly<00:01:54.009> we've<00:01:54.159> actually<00:01:54.369> done<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.789> before

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
exactly we've actually done that before

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.469 
exactly we've actually done that before
and<00:01:57.099> we're<00:01:57.639> working<00:01:57.909> on<00:01:58.029> a<00:01:58.060> variety<00:01:58.270> of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and we're working on a variety of

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.359 
and we're working on a variety of
different<00:01:58.630> ways<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:58.990> strap<00:01:59.859> things<00:02:00.099> down

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
different ways to strap things down

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.879 
different ways to strap things down
mount<00:02:00.939> things<00:02:01.209> to<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> right<00:02:02.380> now<00:02:02.409> we've<00:02:02.709> got

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
mount things to it right now we've got

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.440 
mount things to it right now we've got
these<00:02:03.039> hooks<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:03.639> we<00:02:03.789> have<00:02:03.969> a<00:02:03.999> number<00:02:04.299> of

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
these hooks but we have a number of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.349 
these hooks but we have a number of
other<00:02:04.630> designs<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.759> goal<00:02:06.999> of<00:02:07.179> making

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
other designs with the goal of making

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.089 
other designs with the goal of making
this<00:02:07.630> pretty<00:02:07.959> much<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> pickup<00:02:08.470> truck<00:02:08.709> on<00:02:08.890> two

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
this pretty much a pickup truck on two

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.190 
this pretty much a pickup truck on two
wheels<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.940> guess<00:02:10.090> what's<00:02:10.270> key<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
wheels and I guess what's key is the the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.230 
wheels and I guess what's key is the the
cargo<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:11.980> fairly<00:02:12.250> low<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.760> ground<00:02:12.849> as

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
cargo is fairly low to the ground as

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.820 
cargo is fairly low to the ground as
opposed<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> being<00:02:13.810> balanced<00:02:14.290> very<00:02:14.530> high<00:02:14.680> up

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
opposed to being balanced very high up

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830 
opposed to being balanced very high up
exactly<00:02:15.490> by<00:02:15.730> keeping<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.090> cargo<00:02:16.390> low<00:02:16.599> and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
exactly by keeping the cargo low and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.570 
exactly by keeping the cargo low and
then<00:02:17.050> also<00:02:17.230> having<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.770> layer<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.130> batteries

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
then also having the layer of batteries

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.520 
then also having the layer of batteries
down<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:19.060> low<00:02:19.240> as<00:02:19.390> well<00:02:19.569> you've<00:02:20.140> got<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> very

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
down here low as well you've got a very

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.080 
down here low as well you've got a very
low<00:02:20.799> center<00:02:21.129> of<00:02:21.159> gravity<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:21.879> very

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
low center of gravity so it's very

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.690 
low center of gravity so it's very
stable<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:23.409> innovative<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:24.069> this<00:02:24.220> idea<00:02:24.549> is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
stable and as innovative as this idea is

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.520 
stable and as innovative as this idea is
you're<00:02:24.879> taking<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.329> step<00:02:25.540> further<00:02:25.780> with

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
you're taking it a step further with

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.070 
you're taking it a step further with
prototype<00:02:27.040> describe<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.850> us<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.630> how<00:02:28.930> this

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
prototype describe to us with how this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.970 
prototype describe to us with how this
is<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> work<00:02:29.530> once<00:02:29.740> you've<00:02:29.860> had<00:02:29.920> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
is going to work once you've had a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.590 
is going to work once you've had a
chance<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.640> build<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.940> out<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> bit<00:02:31.150> more<00:02:31.330> so

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
chance to to build it out a bit more so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.750 
chance to to build it out a bit more so
this<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.800> built<00:02:33.010> up<00:02:33.190> looks<00:02:33.490> almost

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
this when it's all built up looks almost

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880 
this when it's all built up looks almost
identical<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.840> other<00:02:35.020> one<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.740> key

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
identical to this other one the key

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.410 
identical to this other one the key
difference<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.550> this<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:36.910> folds<00:02:37.300> in

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
difference is that this one folds in

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.500 
difference is that this one folds in
half<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.100> your<00:02:39.250> destination<00:02:39.510> yank

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
half so you get to your destination yank

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.090 
half so you get to your destination yank
up<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> handlebars<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.740> these<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.010> these

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
up on the handlebars so these are these

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100 
up on the handlebars so these are these
hinge<00:02:42.459> pots<00:02:42.760> here<00:02:43.120> yeah<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.540> pinch<00:02:43.870> here

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
hinge pots here yeah it's a pinch here

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.140 
hinge pots here yeah it's a pinch here
and<00:02:44.290> there<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:45.220> compresses<00:02:45.520> down<00:02:45.910> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and there and it compresses down to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190 
and there and it compresses down to
about<00:02:46.360> 50%<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.830> original<00:02:47.920> footprint<00:02:49.200> okay

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
about 50% of the original footprint okay

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.140 
about 50% of the original footprint okay
so<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.770> destination<00:02:51.030> look<00:02:52.030> for

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so we get to the destination look for

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
so we get to the destination look for
that<00:02:52.239> yep<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.140> whole<00:02:53.170> thing<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.680> why<00:02:53.980> would

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that yep the whole thing up so why would

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.710 
that yep the whole thing up so why would
you<00:02:54.160> want<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.400> fold<00:02:54.610> your<00:02:54.790> bike<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.270> half

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
you want to fold your bike in half

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.340 
you want to fold your bike in half
that<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.680> really<00:02:57.520> huge<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.720> lot<00:02:59.320> of

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
that will be really huge in a lot of

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.320 
that will be really huge in a lot of
places<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.920> China<00:03:00.190> where<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.790> norm<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.300> to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
places like China where the norm is to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
places like China where the norm is to
not<00:03:01.690> leave<00:03:01.989> your<00:03:02.290> scooter<00:03:02.650> parked<00:03:02.980> out<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
not leave your scooter parked out on the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.530 
not leave your scooter parked out on the
street<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.790> actually<00:03:04.060> bring<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.360> into

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
street but to actually bring it into

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.790 
street but to actually bring it into
your<00:03:04.690> apartment<00:03:05.170> building<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
your apartment building with you see the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.320 
your apartment building with you see the
bike<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.160> action<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.730> streets<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:13.180> this

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
bike in action on the streets here this

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.240 
bike in action on the streets here this
isn't<00:03:13.569> just<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.840> prototype<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.709> your<00:03:14.860> workshop

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
isn't just a prototype in your workshop

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.430 
isn't just a prototype in your workshop
this<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> real<00:03:16.330> riding<00:03:16.780> bike<00:03:16.959> being<00:03:17.230> driven

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
this is a real riding bike being driven

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.820 
this is a real riding bike being driven
very<00:03:18.190> confidently<00:03:18.640> by<00:03:18.910> angular<00:03:19.330> here<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:20.739> was

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
very confidently by angular here it was

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.890 
very confidently by angular here it was
very<00:03:21.010> quiet<00:03:21.250> going<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.970> us<00:03:22.060> yeah<00:03:22.600> that's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
very quiet going up to us yeah that's

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.330 
very quiet going up to us yeah that's
one<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.170> benefits<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.590> electric<00:03:23.950> vehicles

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
one of the benefits of electric vehicles

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.370 
one of the benefits of electric vehicles
they're<00:03:24.519> very<00:03:24.730> quiet<00:03:24.970> how<00:03:25.750> long<00:03:26.019> do<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.290> think

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
they're very quiet how long do you think

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.080 
they're very quiet how long do you think
before<00:03:26.769> we<00:03:27.280> see<00:03:27.550> something<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.940> this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
before we see something like this

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.280 
before we see something like this
commercially<00:03:28.750> available

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
commercially available
