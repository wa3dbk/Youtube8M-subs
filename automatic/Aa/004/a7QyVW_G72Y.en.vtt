00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 citroen c4 sedan on the basis of the past 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.050
 of the year became the best-selling car 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 brand citroen from total sales 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 it was him that accounted for almost half 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.369
 therefore you could not circumvent this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 car by country and in this review 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.900
 consider what he is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900
 presents 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 externally, the car was very spectacular 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 mainly due to the fact that the French 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 did not begin to attack all known 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.060
 rake and stupidly sculpt the trunk of a hatchback 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 exactly drew the back of the car by 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.250
 new without forgetting to supply it and the modified 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 you are stamping visually endowing cars 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 a certain aura of swiftness 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.670
 In general, this is the rare case when 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 sedan returned from walking to turned out 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.110
 perhaps even better than the original 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.120
 the amount of luggage in the normal state 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.070
 is 440 liters which is very solid 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.410
 considering that the class leader has this 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.180
 the index is above all 10 20 liters 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.310
 at the same time under the raised floor 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.800
 located full reserve on 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.420
 molded disk lack of the same trunk 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.200
 can be called its capabilities by 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.240
 transformations 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.640
 After all, it is important to increase the volume 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 will not allow a flat floor will not work 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:35.350
 Is that lengthy can carry on 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 the back row is nicely stock 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.670
 place in the legs really happy spoils everything 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.369
 Is that the sloping roof for which I 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.009
 with the growth of 180 centimeters already propped up 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.869
 her head add to this mage is developed 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.240
 that the door is located middle 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.080
 pocket size is bigger here 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.789
 comfort 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.950
 nothing and no moving forward 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.500
 you come across as we understood from curitel 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.570
 technology at first glance, all look 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.619
 chic beautiful armchair with developed 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.780
 lateral support 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.539
 nice interior trimmed with soft plastic 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.330
 and generally it looks very dignified and 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.020
 then begins the same mount 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.240
 technology 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.310
 getting behind the wheel is not very convenient 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.560
 constantly something in the process rests 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.450
 yes and the chair is shifted strongly back and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.150
 half overlaps the central 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.340
 stand and sitting down you start looking 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.709
 seat adjustment knobs and 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.630
 when you find them you understand what you did 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.849
 them for people with non-standard anatomy 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.040
 so as to adjust the backrest tilt 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.140
 you just have to twist the arm 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.540
 and visually present lateral 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 support was only props but about 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.860
 this later is a similar story with a pen 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.709
 adjustability 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.470
 steering wheel and and hid so 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.300
 descent find not easy but in principle on 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.310
 such defects can close your eyes 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.370
 when is it supposed to drive a car 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.230
 there will be one person and once set up no longer 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.099
 will touch the seat and steering settings 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.099
 as it usually happens 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.050
 as for the interior as a whole, the salon 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.480
 looks quite decent then materials 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.000
 good except the color of the torpedo finish 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.280
 chosen very strange to me every time 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.710
 sitting in the car wanted to highlight it for 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.300
 it seems as though the torpedoes are stained though 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.820
 in fact, this is just an illusion 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.890
 but you can still wish citroen sheep 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.880
 if we use closer to the front 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.490
 cheap plastic 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.260
 that light match the tone 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.720
 but it really catches the eye 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.090
 ergonomics plan is essentially one claim 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.770
 at a convenient landing for me 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.050
 reach for the buttons on the central 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.880
 the tunnel had to rise that 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.600
 you understand not very convenient especially 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.600
 on a hobby 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.480
 Well, now let's move on to the main thing 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 what is driving ours 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.010
 citroen check and start as usual with 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.200
 visibility with it in general, everything is in order 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.040
 except that in the cabin mirror could be 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.860
 and more 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.860
 to the feeling of dimensions also special 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.960
 no questions but from behind parktronics i 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.630
 I would not recommend to refuse 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.240
 As for the dynamics, then everything is available 3 1 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.290
 and 6 liter engine 2 aspirated 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.390
 developing 116 and 120 forces 1 is aggregated 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.100
 exclusively mechanics accelerates the car 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.080
 up to a hundred in 10 point nine 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.710
 seconds and consumes nine and a half 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.170
 in the city and 5.8 liters per hundred on the highway 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.360
 There are only enough sides to the plot 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.190
 old 4 speed automatic and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 despite the extra four 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.260
 horses with him dispersal to hundreds takes 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.860
 almost 13 seconds at the stated expense in 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.740
 9.9 in the city and 5.6 in the highway 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.320
 we had a top one on the test 1 6 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.330
 liter turbo motor developing 150 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.770
 horses and aggregated modern 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.750
 six-speed automatic 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.090
 thanks to which the first hundred cars 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.220
 clears in 9.3 seconds 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.440
 what's really abundantly enough and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.270
 city ​​and on the highway give the machine here 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.890
 work great instantly 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.740
 dumping transfer in case of divorce 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.960
 and he clearly understands you need 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.340
 just speed up a bit or commit 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.380
 overtaking 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.980
 the latter case, he cheerfully resets 2 3 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.950
 transmission 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.000
 and you get the necessary acceleration 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.660
 his passport fuel consumption 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.150
 is up 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.150
 11.3 and 6 liters respectively 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.000
 and to match the dynamics here and 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.380
 handling no of course the car never 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.780
 not a driver sky and roll in corners 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.759
 are present but given that she has 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.250
 clearance for more than other crossovers 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.440
 namely 175 millimeters and at the same time 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.509
 the suspension is comfortable enough and not even 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.190
 on the best ways for credit 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.669
 manageability car gets quite 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.759
 well-deserved but known ideal 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.740
 no cars and citroen is no exception 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.789
 driver deficiency returns us 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.430
 back to the salon 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.440
 namely to the notorious chair if 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.330
 honestly visually they look cool and 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.930
 it seems that they should be comfortable and 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.970
 nice but in reality it's a little different 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.250
 No, of course when you go straight into them 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.169
 quite comfortable but this feeling 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.419
 instantly leaves you when you 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.400
 make the first turn since 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.979
 lateral support is not here in principle 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.990
 and all these developed sides are nothing more than 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.580
 foam props as a result 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.949
 keep yourself in the driver's seat 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.780
 one has to kneel against the door and 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.690
 central tunnel what a few 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.430
 annoying and my knees hurt then 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.030
 what pad to what central tunnel 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.120
 right shoot either in terms of security 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.979
 citroen c4 quite well according to the results 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.409
 European crash tests he got 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.349
 cherished 5 stars or 90 out of 100 possible 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.510
 penalty score of 10 points he was given for 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.800
 side impact about the pole case of which 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.039
 chest suffers 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.090
 as well as for head restraints not 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.190
 providing adequate protection against 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.479
 Christ's injuries 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.190
 frontal impact test with a small 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.190
 crossing the car did not pass 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.550
 before you sum up 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.620
 that in this review we called only 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.930
 official fuel consumption 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.450
 The reason for this is that the test was 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.400
 absolutely 0 car and you know 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.620
 the period of running-in is drastically 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.960
 differs from the stated more so 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.300
 turbo we note only that even 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.090
 officially declared expense for our taste 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.940
 too big for a modern car 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.800
 now the conclusions are actually all simple 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.840
 you need a practical car for everyone 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.640
 a day with good dynamics of modern 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.130
 looks and you're ready to come to terms with 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.470
 frankly wretched chairs, given 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.540
 cost of 870,000 for the maximum 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.940
 complete set with navigation and other 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:38.060
 Citroen C4 sedan quite 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.910
 worthy choice and our choice is or 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.250
 16 with mechanics or a turbo engine with 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.110
 six-speed automatic and here is the version 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.660
 with 4 speed automatic still 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.540
 too gluttonous and sad in terms of 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.400
 dynamics in general last century if 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.070
 I want something more driver's someone 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.500
 look ford focus or opel astra 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.750
 and if you need a bigger trunk then 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.340
 initial versions of skoda octavia too 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:06.890
 not a bad alternative on this 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.220
 Subscribe to new ones 

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.220
