00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
like a light brown on color and I did

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
like a light brown on color and I did
color<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> black<00:00:54.329> using<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> revlon

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

colorsilk um color in soft black and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
colorsilk um color in soft black and
using<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> color<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> hair<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> actually

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
using that color on the hair it actually

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
using that color on the hair it actually
deposited<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> ends<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> the
