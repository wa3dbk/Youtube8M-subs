sure I've seen the same exact model come

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.080 
sure I've seen the same exact model come
in<00:00:22.450> here<00:00:22.660> with<00:00:23.200> a<00:00:23.230> slightly<00:00:23.590> different<00:00:23.800> design

worked<00:00:29.680> on<00:00:30.360> had<00:00:31.360> I<00:00:31.689> believe<00:00:32.079> was<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.290> master<00:00:32.680> and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
a slave inverter board on it so maybe it

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.780 
a slave inverter board on it so maybe it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
while plugging it in but I still

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
couldn't get the backlight to come on so

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.120 
couldn't get the backlight to come on so
the<00:01:03.730> first<00:01:03.850> thing<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.150> did<00:01:04.299> was<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.600> checked<00:01:04.900> my

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
the first thing I did was I checked my

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.859 
the first thing I did was I checked my
24<00:01:06.130> volt<00:01:06.369> line<00:01:06.549> coming<00:01:07.119> from<00:01:07.240> my<00:01:07.390> power<00:01:07.600> supply

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
24 volt line coming from my power supply

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.590 
24 volt line coming from my power supply
to<00:01:08.079> my<00:01:08.380> inverter<00:01:08.590> board<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.189> was<00:01:09.310> there

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to my inverter board and it was there

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.179 
to my inverter board and it was there
and<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:11.079> sort<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.409> jumped<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.680> gun<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.100> I

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
and I sort of jumped the gun and I

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.100 
and I sort of jumped the gun and I
assumed<00:01:12.460> Oh<00:01:12.790> probably<00:01:13.420> bad<00:01:13.600> inverter<00:01:13.930> I'll

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
assumed Oh probably bad inverter I'll

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.080 
assumed Oh probably bad inverter I'll
just<00:01:14.229> go<00:01:14.380> ahead<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.680> pick<00:01:15.310> one<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.579> on<00:01:15.700> eBay

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
just go ahead and pick one up on eBay

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.489 
just go ahead and pick one up on eBay
found<00:01:17.020> one<00:01:17.229> for<00:01:17.380> 30<00:01:17.590> bucks<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:19.380> before<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
found one for 30 bucks and before the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.440 
found one for 30 bucks and before the
board<00:01:20.710> came<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.130> started<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.670> think<00:01:21.850> about<00:01:22.270> this

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
board came I started to think about this

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.849 
board came I started to think about this
TV<00:01:22.659> again<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.049> thought<00:01:23.289> you<00:01:23.409> know<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> didn't

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
TV again I thought you know I didn't

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.099 
TV again I thought you know I didn't
really<00:01:23.950> take<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.369> time<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.789> double-check<00:01:25.119> the

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
really take the time to double-check the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.469 
really take the time to double-check the

board feeding the the inverter there's a

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.940

come<00:01:39.429> on<00:01:39.579> before<00:01:40.030> it'll<00:01:40.179> recognize<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.310> fact

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
come on before it'll recognize the fact

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.879 
come on before it'll recognize the fact

that it's getting power from the power
supply<00:01:45.630> anyway<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.689> decided<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:47.020> look<00:01:47.170> over<00:01:47.350> the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.719 
supply anyway I decided to look over the
main<00:01:47.590> board<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:50.159> happen<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.249> find<00:01:51.459> a<00:01:51.549> couple

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
main board and happen to find a couple

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.379 
main board and happen to find a couple
bad<00:01:51.999> capacitors<00:01:52.659> that's<00:01:53.499> all<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:55.299> this

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
bad capacitors that's all it was in this

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.840 
bad capacitors that's all it was in this
case<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.829> can't<00:01:57.069> hardly<00:01:57.310> tell<00:01:57.549> they're<00:01:57.700> bad

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
case you can't hardly tell they're bad

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.969 
case you can't hardly tell they're bad
looking<00:01:58.179> at<00:01:58.299> them<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.600> just<00:01:58.840> barely<00:01:59.469> bulged

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
looking at them that just barely bulged

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.590

on there and in fact my meter my ESR
meter<00:02:04.630> wasn't<00:02:05.200> able<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.529> detect<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:05.979> was

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
meter wasn't able to detect there was

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.289 
meter wasn't able to detect there was
any<00:02:06.219> problem<00:02:06.700> because<00:02:06.819> there<00:02:07.060> were<00:02:07.119> other

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
any problem because there were other

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.880 
any problem because there were other
components<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> parallel<00:02:08.380> with<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
components in parallel with the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.780 
components in parallel with the
capacitors<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.690> gave<00:02:10.690> me<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> false<00:02:11.440> reading

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
capacitors that gave me a false reading

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.720 
capacitors that gave me a false reading
so<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.000> case<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.360> had<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> unsolder<00:02:13.990> them

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so in this case I had to unsolder them

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
so in this case I had to unsolder them
even<00:02:15.730> though<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.849> have<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.209> nice<00:02:16.420> capacitor

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
even though I have this nice capacitor

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.050 
even though I have this nice capacitor
checker<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:18.220> doesn't<00:02:18.520> happen<00:02:18.640> too<00:02:18.880> often

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
checker that doesn't happen too often

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.430 
checker that doesn't happen too often
but<00:02:19.209> every<00:02:19.330> one<00:02:19.569> small<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.990> will<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.319> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
but every one small you will have to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.530 
but every one small you will have to
unsolder<00:02:20.740> one<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.550> make<00:02:22.510> sure

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
unsolder one just to make sure

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
unsolder one just to make sure
especially<00:02:23.349> if<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:23.620> two<00:02:23.800> capacitors<00:02:24.280> in

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
especially if you have two capacitors in

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.270 
especially if you have two capacitors in
parallel<00:02:24.460> that'll<00:02:25.150> trick<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.980> anyway

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
parallel that'll trick it so anyway

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.449 
parallel that'll trick it so anyway

you might want to take note of where the

they<00:02:54.040> are<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.510> particular

they are so if you have this particular

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.199 
they are so if you have this particular
model<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.470> never<00:02:57.400> know<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.700> might<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.060> a

model you never know it might be a
problem<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.870> should<00:02:59.590> say<00:02:59.800> though<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.160> this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
problem I should say though this this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.220 
problem I should say though this this
particular<00:03:00.880> model<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.540> noticed<00:03:01.840> when<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.959> looked

in Mike's TV case history is this

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.540 
in Mike's TV case history is this
particular<00:03:04.000> model<00:03:04.360> had<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> lot<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.019> possible

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
particular model had a lot of possible
