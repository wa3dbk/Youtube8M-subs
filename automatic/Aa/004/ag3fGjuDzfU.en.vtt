00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
with the ipad and why don't you just

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.379 
with the ipad and why don't you just
leave<00:00:07.560> reference<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.370> basic<00:00:08.880> controls<00:00:09.210> here

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
leave reference the basic controls here

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.200 
leave reference the basic controls here
all<00:00:10.019> right<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.320> right<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:10.559> i<00:00:10.920> am<00:00:10.980> driving<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
all right so right now i am driving the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.299 
all right so right now i am driving the
ball<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.139> Sphero<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:13.920> basically

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
ball with the Sphero it's just basically

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.000 
ball with the Sphero it's just basically
like<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:15.269> around<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.660> compass<00:00:16.080> when<00:00:16.980> i

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
like going around the compass when i

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.769 
like going around the compass when i
pick<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> heading<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.150> moves<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
pick a heading and just kind of moves to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.420 
pick a heading and just kind of moves to
that<00:00:18.930> new<00:00:19.109> heading<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.770> hold<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that new heading and I hold it and it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.660 
that new heading and I hold it and it
goes<00:00:20.689> it<00:00:21.689> goes<00:00:21.810> straight<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.380> let<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> ball

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
goes it goes straight I let go the ball

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.080 
goes it goes straight I let go the ball
stops<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:25.199> choose<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.529> color<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
stops I can choose my color so it's a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.439 
stops I can choose my color so it's a
full<00:00:27.330> RGB<00:00:27.689> spectrum<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.949> could<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
full RGB spectrum here I could make the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.170 
full RGB spectrum here I could make the
ball<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.750> whatever<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> wants<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ball do whatever it wants I can do a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.639 
ball do whatever it wants I can do a
timer<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.840> doing<00:00:33.989> some<00:00:34.230> sort<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.469> obstacle

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
timer if I'm doing some sort of obstacle

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.760 
timer if I'm doing some sort of obstacle
course<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.450> can<00:00:36.450> calibrate<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.680> know

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
course I can calibrate it so that I know

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
course I can calibrate it so that I know
where<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> ball<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.390> soon<00:00:39.450> as

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
where the ball is going to go as soon as

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.830 
where the ball is going to go as soon as
I<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.520> have<00:00:41.520> special<00:00:41.940> boost<00:00:42.270> power<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I start I have special boost power to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.860 
I start I have special boost power to
cause<00:00:43.050> havoc<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.040> carnage<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.660> playing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
cause havoc and carnage when I'm playing

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.279 
cause havoc and carnage when I'm playing
with<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:46.260> opponent<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> clear<00:00:47.550> jump<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.840> can

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
with an opponent or to clear jump I can

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
with an opponent or to clear jump I can
go<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> tilt<00:00:49.770> mode<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.120> drive<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
go to tilt mode where I can drive the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.970 
go to tilt mode where I can drive the
ball<00:00:51.750> simply<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.739> moving<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.620> ipad<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.649> iphone

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
ball simply by moving the ipad or iphone

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.569 
ball simply by moving the ipad or iphone
or<00:00:56.460> ipod<00:00:57.239> touch<00:00:57.480> around<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.309> i<00:00:59.550> have

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
or ipod touch around and then i have

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
or ipod touch around and then i have
pause<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.420> need<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> phone<00:01:01.469> call<00:01:01.500> or

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pause if I need to take a phone call or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
pause if I need to take a phone call or
move<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> another<00:01:02.550> app<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.379> into

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
move to another app I think can go into

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
move to another app I think can go into
my<00:01:04.769> options<00:01:05.280> before<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.240> said<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
my options before I said and I can

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
my options before I said and I can
change<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.140> speeds<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.970> determine<00:01:09.060> how

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
change my speeds so I can determine how

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
change my speeds so I can determine how
fast<00:01:09.600> i<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:11.159> choose<00:01:11.400> how

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
fast i want to go I could choose how

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
fast i want to go I could choose how
much<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> booze<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
much time and want to booze for and I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
much time and want to booze for and I
could<00:01:14.280> turn<00:01:14.430> change<00:01:14.790> how<00:01:15.479> fast<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
could turn change how fast I want to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
could turn change how fast I want to
make<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> turn<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> higher<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
make a turn so this will the higher the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
make a turn so this will the higher the
number<00:01:18.270> i'll<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.750> able<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.110> sharper

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
number i'll be able to make sharper

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.280 
number i'll be able to make sharper
turns<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> requires<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.240> skill<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
turns but it requires more skill and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
turns but it requires more skill and
then<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.920> super<00:01:23.220> special<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
then if I'm really super special I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
then if I'm really super special I
turned<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.210> sport<00:01:24.600> mode<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.470> extra<00:01:25.860> fast<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
turned on sport mode I go extra fast and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
turned on sport mode I go extra fast and
I<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.780> even<00:01:27.990> sharper<00:01:28.409> turns<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.070> once

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I can do even sharper turns but once

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.950 
I can do even sharper turns but once
again<00:01:29.820> requires<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.540> more<00:01:30.689> skill

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
again requires a little bit more skill

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.420 
again requires a little bit more skill
ok<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.439> let's<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> drive<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> ball<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
ok so let's see you drive the ball and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
ok so let's see you drive the ball and
before<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> point<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.020> ball

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
before you do that point out which ball

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
before you do that point out which ball
you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.799> controlling<00:01:35.250> ok<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.570> I'm

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you're going to be controlling ok so I'm

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.200 
you're going to be controlling ok so I'm
going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> dry
