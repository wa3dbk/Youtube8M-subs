00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
we have the siding graphics card water

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.870 
we have the siding graphics card water
cooled<00:00:26.990> at<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.170> moment<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.310> don't<00:00:28.550> have<00:00:28.730> to

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
cooled at the moment you don't have to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.060 
cooled at the moment you don't have to
watch<00:00:29.030> cool<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:29.450> it<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:29.930> only<00:00:30.110> hybrid<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.010> you

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
watch cool it it is only hybrid so you

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.610 
watch cool it it is only hybrid so you
can<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:31.490> run<00:00:31.789> it<00:00:31.880> with<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.059> fan<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.410> so

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
can just run it with the fan and so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.470 
can just run it with the fan and so
we've<00:00:33.739> got<00:00:33.770> bits<00:00:34.100> power<00:00:34.370> block<00:00:34.760> its<00:00:35.239> power
