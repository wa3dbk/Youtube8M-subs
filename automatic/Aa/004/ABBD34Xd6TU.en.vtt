now these are made by O'Neill II and
they<00:01:17.840> could<00:01:18.079> be<00:01:18.259> actually<00:01:18.709> cut<00:01:18.979> down<00:01:19.279> to<00:01:20.149> to

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
they could be actually cut down to to

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.069 
they could be actually cut down to to
lighten<00:01:20.899> them<00:01:21.020> up<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:21.770> these<00:01:22.189> way<00:01:22.600> about<00:01:23.600> 15

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
that second option that I think is

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.879

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
great for stream crossings for disc

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.239 
great for stream crossings for disc
lounging<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:51.950> evening<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.950> see<00:01:55.099> they've

got<00:01:55.399> holes<00:01:55.669> in<00:01:55.909> them<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.359> the<00:01:56.479> water<00:01:56.719> you<00:01:57.439> know

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
got holes in them so the water you know

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.239 
got holes in them so the water you know
pours<00:01:58.999> out<00:01:59.209> of<00:01:59.419> them<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.840> they<00:02:00.469> just<00:02:00.679> dry<00:02:00.950> in

no<00:02:01.279> time<00:02:01.609> at<00:02:01.759> all<00:02:01.849> so<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.450> good<00:02:02.599> option

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
no time at all so that's a good option

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.949 
no time at all so that's a good option
however<00:02:04.189> now<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:04.819> discovered<00:02:05.539> something<00:02:05.779> new

they<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.760> only<00:02:27.200> let's<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.530> they're<00:02:29.040> about

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.000 

12.5<00:02:32.849> ounces<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.189> set<00:02:35.579> of<00:02:35.730> two<00:02:35.909> of<00:02:36.090> them<00:02:36.239> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
12.5 ounces for a set of two of them and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.209 
12.5 ounces for a set of two of them and
you<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.129> they<00:02:38.400> they<00:02:38.909> dry<00:02:39.209> out<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.219> you

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
you know they they dry out you just you

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.830 
you know they they dry out you just you
know<00:02:41.459> they<00:02:41.549> get<00:02:41.700> wet<00:02:41.909> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> stream<00:02:42.419> and<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
know they get wet in the stream and you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.300 
know they get wet in the stream and you
can<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.169> hang<00:02:43.439> them<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.040> dry<00:02:44.280> out

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
can just hang them up and they dry out

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.429 
can just hang them up and they dry out
but<00:02:45.209> they're<00:02:45.359> very<00:02:45.389> very<00:02:45.719> comfortable<00:02:46.019> even

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
but they're very very comfortable even

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.190 
but they're very very comfortable even
when<00:02:46.769> they're<00:02:46.919> wet<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:47.939> this<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:49.079> more

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
when they're wet so this is one more

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.500 
when they're wet so this is one more
option<00:02:49.439> to<00:02:49.739> consider<00:02:49.919> when<00:02:50.549> you're<00:02:50.669> trying<00:02:51.359> to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
option to consider when you're trying to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.409 
option to consider when you're trying to
think<00:02:51.719> about<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.290> an<00:02:53.250> extra<00:02:53.579> pair<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> shoes<00:02:54.030> or

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
think about a an extra pair of shoes or

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.740 
think about a an extra pair of shoes or
just<00:02:55.230> don't<00:02:55.439> take<00:02:55.650> any<00:02:56.150> extra<00:02:57.150> pair<00:02:57.510> at<00:02:57.629> all

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
just don't take any extra pair at all

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.309 
just don't take any extra pair at all
because<00:02:58.049> that's<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.650> ultimate<00:02:58.980> solution<00:02:59.579> but

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
because that's the ultimate solution but

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.310 
because that's the ultimate solution but
something<00:03:01.319> like<00:03:01.469> this<00:03:01.620> also<00:03:01.859> works<00:03:02.129> great
