 other things are good and show you 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.940
 directly what you can do like me 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.670
 go to ff press you have the menu 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.620
 how many times you use him for example but you 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 is a bit packed you get 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.700
 but although the money the child in time 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.740
 gone again 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.149
 but in the time where you leave that only 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.189
 an ATM that can do it 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.140
 I also show it very briefly 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.740
 this is only possible where the banking is here 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.450
 the question 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.240
 i am now on the rest i am 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.409
 went well 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.490
 I do not know where the bank is so 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.799
 does not matter now 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.119
 make a restore pretty quiet 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:04.750
 this is checked admins online that is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 well there you can, for example, riester 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.000
 making heels and live your full 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.120
 you can actually make what can 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.120
 reprints go take live here 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:25.890
 fun 12 54 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.890
 sniper rocket launcher 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.069
 we do not need that, then we go 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 just if you want it as 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.049
 At the top of the report is everything 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.049
 is and here as I wanted 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.060
 tape 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.280
 the weapons 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.819
 because you have to almost what 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.670
 Style is definitely there it does not matter 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.590
 if it seems right you have pressed 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.300
 Something like lo clip and easy 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.489
 Fly around everywhere and everything 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.739
 you turn your attention to heights 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.840
 right control with me it is now 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.209
 the arrow keys to come up and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.530
 to come down the butterflies so that was it 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.160
 high down, of course, high down 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.140
 down 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.209
 it can also be with it sometimes 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.790
 num pad only works with names 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.980
 is made but with two mugs with 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.140
 switching is just the same then listening 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.970
 she then gives her you can still 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.799
 teleport you to any 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.980
 For example , things do not know what 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.450
 works yes or here you can 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.650
 Just port you everywhere 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.030
 you can play as well 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.680
 teleport that works as follows 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.390
 but was teleport I do not know 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.530
 more like the wind play 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.140
 I can definitely play 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.700
 give any player so is the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.830
 of course now just a little stupid 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.990
 because we are band so that's one 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:05.130
 little matter so you have the rest 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.540
 you actually everything yourself 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.680
 you can do almost everything 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.270
 do you can you naturally like 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.459
 hickel spawn there like police squad 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.660
 but that does not matter 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.250
 you have seen it today 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.320
