that spiritual energy flow does

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.679 
that spiritual energy flow does
especially<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:22.699> Russia<00:00:23.699> knee<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> twist<00:00:24.269> step

although the power band is working
always<00:00:28.800> during<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.880> AG<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.980> only

always during at AG but it really only

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
always during at AG but it really only
comes<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.730> play<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.750> into<00:00:34.280> small

his attack by moving my Center away
that's<00:01:03.930> an<00:01:04.080> invasive<00:01:04.409> move<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.309> ria<00:01:05.519> tak

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
that's an invasive move and a ria tak

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
that's an invasive move and a ria tak
what<00:01:06.960> he'll<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.650> doing<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
what he'll I will be doing will be a
Power<00:01:09.000> movement<00:01:09.450> he<00:01:10.350> upsets<00:01:10.890> my<00:01:11.280> center<00:01:13.040> what

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
will Eli will be moving in my center see

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170 
will Eli will be moving in my center see
that's<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> difference<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:23.580> doing<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's the difference about doing it on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.830 
that's the difference about doing it on
to<00:01:24.299> both<00:01:24.479> sides<00:01:25.820> different<00:01:26.820> sides<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.689> I'm

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to both sides different sides so I'm

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.179 
to both sides different sides so I'm
doing<00:01:28.140> something<00:01:28.530> completely<00:01:28.680> different

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
doing something completely different

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
doing something completely different
than<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> love<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.380> they<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> arm

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
than what I love you they had the arm

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
than what I love you they had the arm
movements<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.610> exactly<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.689> course

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
movements are exactly the same of course

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
movements are exactly the same of course
it's<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it's all we're going to do now is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's all we're going to do now is
reverse<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.049> yesterday<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.840> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
reverse what we like yesterday that it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
reverse what we like yesterday that it's
going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> reverse<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.939> start

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
going to reverse it so if we would start

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to reverse it so if we would start
from<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> beginning<00:01:44.240> three<00:01:45.240> points<00:01:45.630> touching

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
from the beginning three points touching

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.289 
from the beginning three points touching
see<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:47.909> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
see that's what I'm going to do now so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.800 
see that's what I'm going to do now so
from<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:49.820> we<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.970> three<00:01:51.299> points<00:01:51.630> touching

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
from here we go three points touching

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.730 
from here we go three points touching
again<00:01:52.350> see

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
again see

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.730 
again see
now<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.700> eli<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> changing<00:01:57.899> his<00:01:58.109> weight

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
now because eli is changing his weight

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.730 
now because eli is changing his weight
to<00:01:58.770> his<00:01:59.130> left<00:01:59.490> leg<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.450> there's<00:02:00.990> my<00:02:01.259> center

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to his left leg here there's my center

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
to his left leg here there's my center
because<00:02:02.159> there's<00:02:02.549> power<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:02.939> he's<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because there's power here he's going to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230 
because there's power here he's going to
turn<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.289> see<00:02:05.009> how<00:02:05.130> he's<00:02:05.280> upset<00:02:05.640> by<00:02:05.820> center

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
turn and see how he's upset by center

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
turn and see how he's upset by center
you<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> difference<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you see so that's the difference in this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.969 
you see so that's the difference in this
doing<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> side<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:10.050> opposed<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
doing at this side as opposed to that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.220 
doing at this side as opposed to that
side<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> arm<00:02:15.360> movements<00:02:15.900> there's<00:02:16.049> no

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
side so the arm movements there's no

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
side so the arm movements there's no
difference<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.459> come<00:02:17.670> through<00:02:17.700> from

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
difference so I just come through from

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.479 
difference so I just come through from
here<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.049> literally<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.680> opened<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.220> hand

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
here I literally just opened this hand

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.280 
here I literally just opened this hand
and<00:02:20.700> push<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.690> three<00:02:21.959> points

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and push so we have three points
