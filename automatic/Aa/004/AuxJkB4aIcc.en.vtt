00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:13.790
To the people of South Africa — (applause)
— people of every race and walk of life

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:25.869
— the world thanks you for sharing Nelson
Mandela with us.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.179
His struggle was your struggle.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.120
His triumph was your triumph.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.650
Your dignity and your hope found expression
in his life.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.860
And your freedom, your democracy is his cherished
legacy.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:01:00.030
It is hard to eulogize any man — to capture
in words not just the facts and the dates

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:11.250
that make a life, but the essential truth
of a person — their private joys and sorrows;

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.140
the quiet moments and unique qualities that
illuminate someone’s soul.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.710
How much harder to do so for a giant of history,
who moved a nation toward justice, and in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.039
the process moved billions around the world.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:40.060
Born during World War I, far from the corridors
of power, a boy raised herding cattle and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:51.770
tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe,
Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.770
of the 20th century.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.899
Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement
— a movement that at its start had little

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.689
prospect for success.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.930
Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice
to the claims of the oppressed and the moral

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.540
necessity of racial justice.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.569
He would endure a brutal imprisonment that
began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev,

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.799
and reached the final days of the Cold War.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.090
Emerging from prison, without the force of
arms, he would — like Abraham Lincoln — hold

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.500
his country together when it threatened to
break apart.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.629
And like America’s Founding Fathers, he
would erect a constitutional order to preserve

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.989
freedom for future generations — a commitment
to democracy and rule of law ratified not

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:54.169
only by his election, but by his willingness
to step down from power after only one term.
