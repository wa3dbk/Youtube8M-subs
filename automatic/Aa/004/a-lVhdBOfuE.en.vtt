00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.910 
how does it compare to to logans
favorable<00:02:26.069> actually<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.940> if<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.660> only<00:02:27.920> play

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
favorable actually and if you only play

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.350 
favorable actually and if you only play
there<00:02:29.099> do<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.520> older<00:02:29.760> street<00:02:29.970> fight<00:02:30.120> against

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
there do the older street fight against

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.940 
there do the older street fight against
or<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> couple<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.440> hours<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.830> won't

or you know a couple of hours you won't
see<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> differences<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.390> everyone<00:02:33.840> who

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
see the differences but for everyone who

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.530 
see the differences but for everyone who
is<00:02:34.170> actually<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.270> learning

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
is actually in this a time and learning

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.360 
is actually in this a time and learning
the<00:02:36.630> techniques<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.200> everything<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the techniques and everything it's a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.680 
the techniques and everything it's a
really<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.150> new<00:02:39.630> game<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
really really new game and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.480 
really really new game and
newly<00:02:41.690> balanced<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.770> course<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.130> our<00:02:43.280> new

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
newly balanced and of course to our new

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.160 
newly balanced and of course to our new
characters<00:02:43.940> added<00:02:44.090> four<00:02:44.599> new<00:02:44.630> characters

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
characters added four new characters

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.470 
characters added four new characters
that<00:02:45.319> selectable<00:02:45.920> from<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> start<00:02:46.489> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
that selectable from the start and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.350 
that selectable from the start and
there's<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.230> new<00:02:48.410> bus<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.890> it's<00:02:49.069> just<00:02:49.580> silly

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
there's a new bus that it's just silly

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.740 
there's a new bus that it's just silly
bad<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.230> horrible<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:52.790> they<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.270> added<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
bad and horrible but they have added the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.650 
bad and horrible but they have added the
revenge<00:02:54.290> gauge<00:02:54.650> which<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:56.000> actually<00:02:56.270> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
revenge gauge which is actually the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.449 
revenge gauge which is actually the
reverse<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.650> supergate<00:02:58.040> said<00:02:58.310> you

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
reverse of the supergate said you

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.080 
reverse of the supergate said you
normally<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.959> know<00:03:00.190> ChaCha<00:03:01.190> when<00:03:01.880> when

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
normally you know ChaCha when when

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.030 
normally you know ChaCha when when
hitting<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.540> enemy<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.410> just<00:03:03.830> works

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
hitting the enemy and this just works

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.240 
hitting the enemy and this just works
that<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.700> get<00:03:04.880> didn't<00:03:05.270> really<00:03:05.510> bad<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that if you get didn't really bad this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.590 
that if you get didn't really bad this
powers<00:03:07.250> up<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.730> you're<00:03:07.850> able<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.239> deliver

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
powers up and you're able to deliver

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.589 
powers up and you're able to deliver
super<00:03:09.019> attack<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.160> also<00:03:10.489> they<00:03:10.670> had<00:03:10.849> focus

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
super attack and also they had focus

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.350 
super attack and also they had focus
attacks<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.170> works<00:03:12.769> in<00:03:13.030> three<00:03:14.030> different

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
attacks that works in three different

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.900 
attacks that works in three different
tiers<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:15.050> let<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:16.010> charge<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.489> an<00:03:16.610> attack

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
tiers that let you charge of an attack

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.120 
tiers that let you charge of an attack
and<00:03:17.150> actually<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:19.430> drop<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.989> enemies<00:03:21.130> combo

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
and actually just drop a enemies combo

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.680 
and actually just drop a enemies combo
and<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:23.420> might<00:03:24.200> seem<00:03:24.709> really<00:03:25.430> simple<00:03:25.640> but<00:03:26.269> it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
and it might seem really simple but it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.620 
and it might seem really simple but it
just<00:03:27.019> opens<00:03:27.830> up<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.280> many<00:03:28.340> techniques<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.330> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
just opens up so many techniques and it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.199 
just opens up so many techniques and it
destroys<00:03:30.590> some<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.069> old<00:03:31.250> very<00:03:31.790> passive

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
destroys some of the old very passive

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.910 
destroys some of the old very passive
gaming<00:03:32.540> styles<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:32.989> some<00:03:33.200> players<00:03:33.410> had<00:03:33.650> with

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
gaming styles that some players had with

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.350 
gaming styles that some players had with
the<00:03:34.010> old<00:03:34.100> street<00:03:34.400> fighter<00:03:34.610> games<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.090> really

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the old street fighter games and really

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.140 
the old street fighter games and really
forces<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.100> really<00:03:38.000> aggressive

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
forces you to to be really aggressive

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.490 
forces you to to be really aggressive
which<00:03:39.080> makes<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.950> course<00:03:40.400> more<00:03:40.610> fun<00:03:41.500> and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
which makes for of course more fun and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.009 
which makes for of course more fun and
also<00:03:42.769> just<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.549> timing<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
also just the timing and and the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.680 
also just the timing and and the
character<00:03:45.410> size<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.459> actual<00:03:46.670> screen<00:03:47.030> or

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
character size on the actual screen or

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.780 
character size on the actual screen or
just<00:03:48.019> somehow<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.769> different<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:49.730> you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
just somehow it be different so you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.550 
just somehow it be different so you
really<00:03:50.209> need<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.510> learn<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.049> game<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.410> was

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
to all the powerful moves from the game

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.760 
to all the powerful moves from the game
from<00:05:12.210> all<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.540> characters<00:05:12.900> in<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.020> game<00:05:13.080> so
