00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.870 
to the outside he gets beat a lot let's
stay<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.229> inside<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.860> defender<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.460> think

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
stay on the inside of a defender I think

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.680 
stay on the inside of a defender I think
for<00:04:27.000> him<00:04:27.180> though<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.360> mean

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
for him though I mean

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.600 
for him though I mean
future<00:04:28.020> again<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.560> very<00:04:28.650> bright<00:04:29.280> once<00:04:29.550> he

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
future again it's very bright once he

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.490 
future again it's very bright once he
gets<00:04:29.760> on<00:04:29.850> your<00:04:29.970> searles<00:04:30.330> for<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> year<00:04:31.230> or<00:04:31.260> two

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
