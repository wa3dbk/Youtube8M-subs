this<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.799> new<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.130> me<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> do

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this is kind of like new to me but I do

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
this is kind of like new to me but I do
think<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> piece<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.170> steel<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.619> can

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
think I have a piece of steel that I can

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
think I have a piece of steel that I can
just<00:02:07.979> completely<00:02:08.340> replace<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.330> which

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
just completely replace that with which

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.990 
just completely replace that with which
I'm<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.619> exactly<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.280> mood<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.730> either

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
I'm not exactly in the mood to do either

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.650 
I'm not exactly in the mood to do either
so<00:02:12.270> up

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so up

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.230 
so up
probably<00:02:12.960> just<00:02:13.310> rebuild<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.820> what

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
probably just rebuild this one what

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.850 
probably just rebuild this one what
shouldn't<00:02:15.690> take<00:02:15.900> much<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.470> all

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
shouldn't take much at all

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.830 
shouldn't take much at all
so<00:02:17.160> anyways<00:02:17.460> we'll<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.760> onto<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.300> okay<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so anyways we'll get onto it okay as you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.160 
so anyways we'll get onto it okay as you
can<00:02:19.020> see<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.710> powder<00:02:23.040> coated<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.170> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
can see this is powder coated and you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
can see this is powder coated and you
know<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.850> bent<00:02:27.120> outward

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
know so but it's actually bent outward

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.410 
know so but it's actually bent outward
backwards<00:02:28.260> towards<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.740> tractor<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.120> I'm

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
backwards towards the tractor so I'm

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
backwards towards the tractor so I'm
gonna<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.140> actually<00:02:31.350> lay<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
gonna have to do is actually lay it be a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
gonna have to do is actually lay it be a
few<00:02:32.550> beads<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.000> weld<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.450> there<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.960> build

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
few beads of weld in there and build

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.190 
few beads of weld in there and build
that<00:02:34.650> back<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.190> again<00:02:35.720> strengthen<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.810> back<00:02:36.960> up

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that back up again strengthen it back up

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
that back up again strengthen it back up
again<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.070> can<00:02:38.190> hear<00:02:38.250> Timothy<00:02:38.880> he's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
again but as you can hear Timothy he's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.720 
again but as you can hear Timothy he's
running<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> grinder<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.740> he'll<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.430> couple

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
running the grinder so he'll be a couple

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.040 
running the grinder so he'll be a couple
minutes<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.210> I'll<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.480> able<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
minutes and then I'll be able to do that

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.380 
minutes and then I'll be able to do that
but<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.350> gonna<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.430> bang<00:02:45.180> that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
but I'm gonna right now just bang that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.330 
but I'm gonna right now just bang that
back<00:02:45.660> with<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.960> hammer<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> closes

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
back with a hammer so that it closes

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.700 
back with a hammer so that it closes
that<00:02:47.760> gas<00:02:48.000> enough<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.930> I'm<00:02:49.140> gonna<00:02:49.380> make<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
that gas enough and I'm gonna make a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.130 
that gas enough and I'm gonna make a
really<00:02:50.400> good<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.850> bear<00:02:51.210> hopefully<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> really

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
really good well bear hopefully a really

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.520 
really good well bear hopefully a really
good<00:02:52.320> okay<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.350> maybe<00:02:55.350> you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
good okay so as you can see maybe you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.530 
good okay so as you can see maybe you
can<00:02:55.710> see<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.070> hoping<00:02:56.340> that's<00:02:56.520> focusing<00:02:57.090> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
can see I'm hoping that's focusing I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.160 
can see I'm hoping that's focusing I
have<00:02:58.320> cleaned<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.130> up<00:02:59.190> pretty<00:02:59.460> good<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
have cleaned that up pretty good and I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500 
have cleaned that up pretty good and I
actually<00:03:01.380> cut<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> groove<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.820> corner

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
actually cut a groove in the corner

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.570 
actually cut a groove in the corner
there<00:03:03.660> where<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.870> crack<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.830> I'm<00:03:05.370> gonna

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
there where that crack is and I'm gonna

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.520 
there where that crack is and I'm gonna
lay<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> bead<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.150> weld<00:03:06.360> down<00:03:06.690> into<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.170> thing

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
lay a bead of weld down into that thing

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.620 
lay a bead of weld down into that thing
and<00:03:07.770> I'm<00:03:08.700> actually<00:03:08.880> gonna<00:03:09.150> lay<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> couple

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and I'm actually gonna lay a couple

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.600 
and I'm actually gonna lay a couple
beads<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.440> try<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.710> strengthen<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.340> up<00:03:11.490> a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
beads on there try to strengthen it up a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.580 
beads on there try to strengthen it up a
little<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.970> better<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.480> then<00:03:12.540> I'm<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
little bit better and then I'm going to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.470 
little bit better and then I'm going to
cut<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> piece<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.430> flat<00:03:14.670> iron<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.180> put<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.390> on

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
cut a piece of flat iron and put it on

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.650 
cut a piece of flat iron and put it on
behind<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.110> now<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.550> don't<00:03:18.209> think<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.570> as

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
behind this now I don't think it's as

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.720 
behind this now I don't think it's as
important<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.560> don't<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.520> it's

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
important is I don't think it's

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
important is I don't think it's
SuperDuper<00:03:21.209> important<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.590> thing

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
SuperDuper important to have this thing

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.210 
SuperDuper important to have this thing
like<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:24.090> tight<00:03:24.420> because<00:03:25.170> all<00:03:25.590> such<00:03:25.770> doing

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
like really tight because all such doing

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.100 
like really tight because all such doing
is<00:03:26.370> down<00:03:26.730> pressure<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.780> thing<00:03:27.959> here

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
is down pressure so this thing here

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.440 
is down pressure so this thing here
comes<00:03:28.320> at<00:03:28.590> pinches<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.190> there<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.640> blah<00:03:30.180> blah

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
comes at pinches in there and blah blah

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.070 
comes at pinches in there and blah blah
blah

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
blah

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.630 
blah
but<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.500> side<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.190> good<00:03:32.310> shape<00:03:32.580> so

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
but this side here is in good shape so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.100 
but this side here is in good shape so
we're<00:03:32.940> not<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.180> gonna<00:03:33.420> worry<00:03:33.660> about<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.080> I

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
we're not really gonna worry about it I

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.320 
we're not really gonna worry about it I
may<00:03:34.380> run<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> little<00:03:34.860> bead<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.790> here<00:03:36.120> just

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
may run a little bead here and here just

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.080 
may run a little bead here and here just
for<00:03:37.230> added<00:03:37.440> strength<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.820> most<00:03:38.970> part

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
for added strength but for the most part

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.320 
for added strength but for the most part
I<00:03:39.390> think<00:03:39.450> we're<00:03:39.720> pretty<00:03:39.900> good<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.800> anyway<00:03:41.430> I'll

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
I think we're pretty good so anyway I'll

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.100 
I think we're pretty good so anyway I'll
be<00:03:42.390> onto<00:03:42.840> it

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
be onto it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.160 
be onto it
alright<00:03:43.970> after<00:03:44.970> welding<00:03:45.330> through<00:03:45.900> dirty

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
alright after welding through dirty

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.890 
alright after welding through dirty
steel<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:48.150> having<00:03:48.330> some<00:03:48.510> problems

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
with the consumables getting jammed up I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.520 
with the consumables getting jammed up I
don't<00:03:54.300> think<00:03:54.450> that's<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.750> bad<00:03:54.930> looking<00:03:55.350> well

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
don't think that's a bad looking well

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
don't think that's a bad looking well
then<00:03:55.770> no<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.400> used<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.790> grinder<00:03:57.209> on

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
then no I have not used the grinder on

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.210 
then no I have not used the grinder on
it<00:03:57.420> yet<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:58.440> sure<00:03:58.590> looks<00:03:58.800> better<00:03:58.980> than<00:03:59.100> that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
it yet it sure looks better than that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.190 
it yet it sure looks better than that
hay<00:03:59.400> wagon<00:03:59.820> but<00:04:00.239> anyways<00:04:00.600> yeah<00:04:00.780> that's<00:04:01.020> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
hay wagon but anyways yeah that's the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.199 
hay wagon but anyways yeah that's the
fix<00:04:01.410> still<00:04:01.980> moves<00:04:02.220> up<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.550> down<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.940> way<00:04:03.060> it's

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
fix still moves up and down the way it's

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.650 
fix still moves up and down the way it's
supposed<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:04.100> if<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.700> not<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.090> tight<00:04:06.300> as<00:04:06.510> it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
supposed to if it's not as tight as it

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.300 
supposed to if it's not as tight as it
should<00:04:06.690> well<00:04:07.140> then<00:04:07.410> that's<00:04:07.650> just<00:04:07.830> tough<00:04:07.980> crap

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
should well then that's just tough crap

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
should well then that's just tough crap
but<00:04:08.550> what<00:04:09.390> I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
but what I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.510 
but what I
on<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:11.240> is<00:04:12.240> pretty<00:04:12.990> simple<00:04:13.410> I'm<00:04:13.830> building<00:04:14.400> up

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
on here is pretty simple I'm building up

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.120 
on here is pretty simple I'm building up
the<00:04:14.670> back<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.960> piece<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.410> steel<00:04:16.650> here

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
the back of this piece of steel here

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
the back of this piece of steel here
just<00:04:17.850> because<00:04:18.239> there's<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.510> lot<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.810> slop<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
just because there's a lot of slop and a

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.170 
just because there's a lot of slop and a
lot<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.799> movement<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.370> there<00:04:20.610> and<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.000> can

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
lot of movement in there and that can

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.110 
lot of movement in there and that can
cause<00:04:21.450> bigger<00:04:21.930> problems<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.770> it's<00:04:22.920> worth<00:04:23.130> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
cause bigger problems and it's worth to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.730 
cause bigger problems and it's worth to
so<00:04:24.570> anyway<00:04:25.020> yeah

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
so anyway yeah
