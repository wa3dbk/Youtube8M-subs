and back it's got enough lip on it so if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469 
and back it's got enough lip on it so if
you<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> drop<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> flat<00:01:26.850> surface<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you were to drop it on a flat surface I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.910 
you were to drop it on a flat surface I
think<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.290> enough<00:01:28.710> protection

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
think you would have enough protection

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
think you would have enough protection
so<00:01:29.490> maybe<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> full<00:01:30.299> body<00:01:30.570> protector

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so maybe with the full body protector

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.069 
so maybe with the full body protector
front<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.939> bumper<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
will probably get enough protection for

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.380 
will probably get enough protection for
everyday<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:37.579> now<00:01:38.579> let's<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.970> ahead<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.180> look

at<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.110> OEM<00:01:40.979> bumper<00:01:41.310> made<00:01:41.729> by<00:01:41.939> LG<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.810> Google

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
at the OEM bumper made by LG and Google

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
at the OEM bumper made by LG and Google
they<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.100> from<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> Play<00:01:44.549> Store<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they can get from the Play Store and you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.200 
they can get from the Play Store and you
can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.590> does<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
can see here that it does have a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
can see here that it does have a
definitely<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.930> premium<00:01:49.350> look<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
definitely more of a premium look to the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
definitely more of a premium look to the
OEM<00:01:51.090> bumper<00:01:51.299> case<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> there's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
OEM bumper case you can see that there's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
OEM bumper case you can see that there's
some<00:01:52.740> texture<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
some texture on the back there but you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
some texture on the back there but you
can<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.020> bezels<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> fat

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
can see that the bezels are kind of fat

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
can see that the bezels are kind of fat
and<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> doesn't<00:01:56.880> make<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> wide<00:01:57.630> but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and it doesn't make it kind of wide but

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499 
and it doesn't make it kind of wide but
now<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.100> poetic<00:01:59.579> case<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> one

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
now the poetic case is that's the one

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
now the poetic case is that's the one
thing<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.719> alleviates<00:02:01.439> which<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
thing that alleviates which I like is

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
thing that alleviates which I like is
that<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.579> feels<00:02:02.820> thinner<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> hand<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that it feels thinner in the hand the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
that it feels thinner in the hand the
bezels<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.520> thick<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.570> will

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
bezels are not as thick and you will

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.749 
bezels are not as thick and you will
notice<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.380> difference<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.280> you're<00:02:08.399> holding

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
notice a difference when you're holding

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.850 
notice a difference when you're holding
this<00:02:08.879> case<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.780> does<00:02:10.050> make<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> feel<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
this case because it does make it feel a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
this case because it does make it feel a
little<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.400> thinner<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> hand

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
little bit thinner in the hand

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.199 
little bit thinner in the hand
but<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> texture<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.290> not<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.819> if<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
but the texture is not there so if you

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.420 
but the texture is not there so if you
look<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.629> this<00:02:15.900> case<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.620> side-by-side<00:02:16.950> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
look at this case here side-by-side I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100 
look at this case here side-by-side I
know<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.849> might<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.000> hard<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.629> on<00:02:18.660> camera

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
know it might be hard to see on camera

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.680 
know it might be hard to see on camera
but<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.430> poetic<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> just

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
but you can see that the poetic is just

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.130 
but you can see that the poetic is just
a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:22.140> bit<00:02:22.440> thinner<00:02:23.269> but<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.629> definitely

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
a little bit thinner but it definitely

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.280 
a little bit thinner but it definitely
is<00:02:25.560> different<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.430> build<00:02:26.910> quality<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.510> look

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
is different on build quality and look

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.490 
is different on build quality and look
and<00:02:28.530> feel<00:02:29.630> you're<00:02:30.630> probably<00:02:30.900> asking<00:02:31.140> though

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and feel you're probably asking though

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.550 
and feel you're probably asking though
what's<00:02:32.040> bad<00:02:32.280> about<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.700> case<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.349> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
what's bad about this case and I have to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280 
what's bad about this case and I have to
say<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.519> falls<00:02:36.060> apart<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.140> one

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
say that it falls apart and this is one

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.960 
say that it falls apart and this is one
of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> biggest<00:02:37.800> things<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.940> been

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
of the biggest things that have been

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.930 
of the biggest things that have been
reviewed<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.200> case<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.549> hope<00:02:41.910> they

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
reviewed on this case and I hope they

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.600 
reviewed on this case and I hope they
rectify<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.810> problem<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.340> does

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
rectify this problem is that it does

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.970 
rectify this problem is that it does
fall<00:02:44.940> apart<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.690> lip<00:02:46.019> definitely<00:02:46.680> starts

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
fall apart and the lip definitely starts

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.339 
fall apart and the lip definitely starts
coming<00:02:47.250> apart<00:02:47.549> on<00:02:47.849> front<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.299> back<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.110> hope

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
coming apart on front and back so I hope

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.870 
coming apart on front and back so I hope
they<00:02:49.560> fix<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.519> could<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.849> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
they fix this this could be a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
they fix this this could be a
deal-breaker<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.900> people<00:02:51.989> so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
deal-breaker for a lot of people so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.850 
deal-breaker for a lot of people so
that's<00:02:53.190> why<00:02:53.519> if<00:02:54.090> i<00:02:54.540> look<00:02:54.750> at<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.049> case<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.709> i

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that's why if i look at this case and i

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.120 
that's why if i look at this case and i
look<00:02:56.099> at<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> OEM<00:02:56.849> case<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:58.319> i'm<00:02:58.680> starting<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
look at the OEM case and i'm starting to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.580 
look at the OEM case and i'm starting to
lean<00:02:59.370> towards<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.299> OEM<00:03:00.930> case<00:03:01.200> even<00:03:01.470> though

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
lean towards the OEM case even though

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.190 
lean towards the OEM case even though
it's<00:03:01.829> much<00:03:01.980> more<00:03:02.220> expensive<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:03.299> looks<00:03:03.840> more

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
it's much more expensive it looks more

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.009 
it's much more expensive it looks more
premium<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.980> makes<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.849> nexus<00:03:06.269> look<00:03:06.510> more

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
premium it makes the nexus look more

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.650 
premium it makes the nexus look more
factory<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:09.060> should<00:03:09.299> be<00:03:09.510> because

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
factory like and it should be because

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.009 
factory like and it should be because
it's<00:03:09.930> made<00:03:10.110> by<00:03:10.319> LG<00:03:10.579> but<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.910> definitely<00:03:12.329> has<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
it's made by LG but it definitely has a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.559 
it's made by LG but it definitely has a
better<00:03:13.410> look<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.190> unfortunately<00:03:14.610> i

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
better look to it and unfortunately i

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.870 
better look to it and unfortunately i
think<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.140> worth<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> price<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.160> bump<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.639> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
think it's worth the price to bump up to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.140 
think it's worth the price to bump up to
the<00:03:18.510> OEM<00:03:18.930> case<00:03:19.489> but<00:03:20.489> if<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:20.760> want<00:03:20.940> something

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the OEM case but if you want something

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.990 
the OEM case but if you want something
cheap<00:03:21.540> for<00:03:22.200> ten<00:03:22.410> dollars<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.489> want<00:03:23.790> some

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
cheap for ten dollars and you want some

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.140 
cheap for ten dollars and you want some
splash<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:25.170> your<00:03:25.410> bumper<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:25.950> you're<00:03:26.790> willing

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
splash to your bumper and you're willing
