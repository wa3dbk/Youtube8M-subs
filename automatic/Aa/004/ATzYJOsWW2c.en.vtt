00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 the military operation involves 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.269
 always risks for activists 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.910
 riadh fehri this meeting in koundouz 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 also when the Belgian advisers 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 follow their Afghan colleagues in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
 patrol they also expose themselves to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 danger that's why the troops of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 protection exist but to ensure 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 safety means getting ready 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 to any incident including on the plane 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.349
 medical for this reason the dr barth 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.670
 vanderheiden organizes an exercise 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.440
 medical evacuation 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.440
 in a word, but waves 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.330
 today we did an exercise 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 medical evacuation with injured 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.760
 simulate this exercise time us 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.150
 get as close as possible to the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.250
 reality but the waves are there for a moment 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.720
 the hurt falls down to his admission to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.720
 the hospital later to simulate 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 repeat the current procedures of 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.659
 mission may seem strange but the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 doctor has his reasons or linda the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 guards procedures all these 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.890
 procedures are tested in belgium but 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 the climate 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.360
 heat the dust and the weight of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.570
 ballistic protection complicate such 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570
 site 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.550
 despite the difficult conditions 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.090
 protective forces and staff 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.330
 medical 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.010
 they respond well whenever such a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.870
 exercise and repeat you find that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.160
 the level increases as a doctor 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.390
 it's nice to see that the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.850
 evacuation drill 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.800
 medical improves the day we will have 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.480
 a real wounded will only be we have 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 made every effort to provide the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.750
 best care 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.150
 aware of this situation the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.830
 military advisers will therefore have 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.830
 the more serene spirit on the ground
