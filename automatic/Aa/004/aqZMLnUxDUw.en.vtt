this is the bx red spread from

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740 
this is the bx red spread from
brainworks<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.760> has<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> number<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.330> controls

first of all an input gain that's just

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.089 
first of all an input gain that's just
to<00:00:12.690> make<00:00:13.230> sure<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.530> your<00:00:13.650> signal<00:00:13.980> isn't

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
to make sure that your signal isn't

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.790 
to make sure that your signal isn't
clipping<00:00:14.519> before<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.910> hits<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.330> plug-in

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
clipping before it hits this plug-in

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
clipping before it hits this plug-in
then<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.400> skip<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.119> way<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> end

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
then if we skip all the way to the end

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.040 
then if we skip all the way to the end
we<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.109> something<00:00:19.500> called<00:00:19.650> spread<00:00:20.779> this<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
we have something called spread this is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
we have something called spread this is
the<00:00:22.230> main<00:00:22.380> feature<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.070> uses<00:00:23.519> m/s

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the main feature this uses m/s

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.410 
the main feature this uses m/s
processing<00:00:24.960> which<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.470> mid/side<00:00:26.039> processing

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420

to<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:29.130> channels<00:00:29.550> actually<00:00:29.789> seem<00:00:30.330> even

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to make the channels actually seem even

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
to make the channels actually seem even
wider<00:00:30.900> than<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.710> normal<00:00:32.099> left<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.430> right

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.240 
panning so what I'm going to do with my
demo<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> I'll<00:00:36.450> record<00:00:36.780> two<00:00:37.079> tracks<00:00:37.410> left<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
demo is I'll record two tracks left and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.720 
demo is I'll record two tracks left and
right<00:00:38.700> panned<00:00:39.030> 100%<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.680> be

right panned 100% there will be

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
right panned 100% there will be
identical<00:00:41.730> rhythm<00:00:41.969> tracks<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.230> be

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
identical rhythm tracks but they will be

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650 
identical rhythm tracks but they will be
actually<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:44.520> separate<00:00:45.090> tracks<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> I've

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
actually two separate tracks that I've

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.560 
actually two separate tracks that I've
recorded<00:00:45.930> rather<00:00:46.320> than<00:00:46.500> duplicating<00:00:46.739> one

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
recorded rather than duplicating one

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.319 
recorded rather than duplicating one
into<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:48.780> tracks<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.820> then<00:00:50.820> I'll<00:00:51.059> show<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
into two tracks and then I'll show you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.420 
into two tracks and then I'll show you
the<00:00:51.510> difference<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> makes<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.739> alter

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the difference it makes when you alter

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.860 
the difference it makes when you alter
this<00:00:54.079> spread<00:00:55.079> value<00:00:55.760> 100%<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.969> normal<00:00:57.449> stereo

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this spread value 100% is normal stereo

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
this spread value 100% is normal stereo
you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> Mono<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> want

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you can take it down to Mono if you want

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
you can take it down to Mono if you want
or<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:01.020> take<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> beyond<00:01:01.649> normal<00:01:02.129> left

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
or you can take it beyond normal left

or you can take it beyond normal left
and<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.820> panning<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.650> hundred<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and right panning to one hundred and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
and right panning to one hundred and
fifty<00:01:05.280> percent<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> two<00:01:05.909> hundred<00:01:05.939> percent

fifty percent up to two hundred percent

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
fifty percent up to two hundred percent
I've<00:01:07.530> found<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.100> hundred<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.400> fifty

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
I've found that one hundred and fifty

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
I've found that one hundred and fifty
percent<00:01:08.820> seemed<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.630> good<00:01:09.750> value

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
percent seemed like a really good value

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
percent seemed like a really good value
to<00:01:10.710> work<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to work with and then if you look to the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.649 
to work with and then if you look to the
left<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> control<00:01:15.540> called

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
left you have this is a control called

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.649 
left you have this is a control called
shred<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.610> does<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> takes<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
shred now what this does is it takes the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.690 
shred now what this does is it takes the
input<00:01:19.259> signal<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> using

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
input signal which I'm going to be using

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
input signal which I'm going to be using
the<00:01:21.000> rock<00:01:21.240> rack<00:01:21.920> from<00:01:22.920> brain<00:01:23.310> works<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.869> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the rock rack from brain works and it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.590 
the rock rack from brain works and it
works<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.350> any<00:01:25.590> amps<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> does

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
works with any amps in and what it does

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
works with any amps in and what it does
is<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.020> takes<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.619> certain<00:01:28.890> frequencies<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
is it takes out certain frequencies that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
is it takes out certain frequencies that
can<00:01:29.909> make<00:01:30.150> plug-in<00:01:30.840> guitars<00:01:31.500> sound<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> bit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
can make plug-in guitars sound a bit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.120 
can make plug-in guitars sound a bit
harsh<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> sort<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> digital<00:01:34.619> kind

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
harsh and have that sort of digital kind

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.060 
harsh and have that sort of digital kind
of<00:01:35.189> edge<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.439> roll<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> up

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of edge to it and you just roll it up

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
of edge to it and you just roll it up
and<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.670> smoothes<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:39.240> certain<00:01:39.689> frequencies

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and it smoothes off certain frequencies

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.080 
and it smoothes off certain frequencies
and<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> probably<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.250> an<00:01:41.400> with

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and it probably would work with an with

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
and it probably would work with an with
an<00:01:42.210> actual<00:01:42.570> amp<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> simulated<00:01:44.310> amp

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
an actual amp as well as a simulated amp

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.440 
an actual amp as well as a simulated amp
and<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.750> smoothes<00:01:46.649> off<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> tone<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> makes

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and it smoothes off the tone and makes

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.510 
and it smoothes off the tone and makes
it<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.380> easier<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.850> sit<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> mix

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
it a little bit easier to sit in the mix

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.819 
it a little bit easier to sit in the mix
then<00:01:53.520> next<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.689> mono<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
then next to it you have a mono you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.490 
then next to it you have a mono you
force<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.640> force<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> mono<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.409> if

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
force you can force it to mono so if

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
force you can force it to mono so if
you've<00:01:58.590> got<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:58.979> left<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.820> guitars

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you've got two left and right guitars

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.539 
you've got two left and right guitars
panned<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.380> puts<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.250> mono<00:02:02.460> track

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
panned it just puts it into a mono track

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.649 
panned it just puts it into a mono track
and<00:02:03.649> then<00:02:04.649> over<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> left<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.540> can

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and then over on the left here you can

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.969 
and then over on the left here you can
see<00:02:06.810> something<00:02:07.140> called<00:02:07.320> solo<00:02:07.920> pan<00:02:09.800> now<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
see something called solo pan now if you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.830 
see something called solo pan now if you
start<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.810> 0%<00:02:12.810> here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
start at 0% here

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.580 
start at 0% here
when<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.010> plugin<00:02:15.819> detects<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.590> you're

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
when it the plugin detects that you're

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.309 
when it the plugin detects that you're
just<00:02:17.950> hearing<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.610> channel<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.660> say<00:02:19.989> if

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
just hearing one channel so say if

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.839 
just hearing one channel so say if
there's<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.769> section<00:02:21.069> whether<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.670> right

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
there's a section whether the right

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.820 
there's a section whether the right
channel<00:02:22.209> suddenly<00:02:22.569> stops<00:02:22.780> playing<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.620> just

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
channel suddenly stops playing you just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.509 
channel suddenly stops playing you just
have<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> left<00:02:24.280> channel<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:25.180> will<00:02:25.510> move<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
have a left channel it will move the the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.780 
have a left channel it will move the the
pan<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.780> guitar<00:02:29.019> right<00:02:30.010> into<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> center

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
pan of that guitar right into the center

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.520 
pan of that guitar right into the center
so<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.239> would<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.660> mono<00:02:31.959> track<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.440> you'll

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
so it would be a mono track and you'll

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.610 
so it would be a mono track and you'll
see<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.069> my<00:02:33.190> demonstration<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:35.530> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
see this in my demonstration what you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.650 
see this in my demonstration what you
can<00:02:35.709> also<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.340> set<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.879> value<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.510> any

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
can also do is set that value to any

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.350 
can also do is set that value to any
percentage<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.810> width<00:02:41.019> here<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.920> 100%<00:02:42.459> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
percentage of the width here so 100% you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.449 
percentage of the width here so 100% you
basically<00:02:43.780> you'll<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.769> if<00:02:44.980> it's

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
basically you'll just have it if it's

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.979 
basically you'll just have it if it's
muting<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.360> you'll<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.870> it

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
muting the right you'll just have it

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.350 
muting the right you'll just have it
playing<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> left<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.849> if<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.120> haven't

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
playing in the left as if you haven't

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.410 
playing in the left as if you haven't
even<00:02:49.690> got<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.049> selected<00:02:50.500> if<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.310> go<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.519> 50%

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
even got this selected if you go to 50%

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
even got this selected if you go to 50%
it<00:02:52.569> will<00:02:52.690> move<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.079> into<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.470> sort<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.829> stereo

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
it will move it into a sort of stereo

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.660 
it will move it into a sort of stereo
field<00:02:54.940> around<00:02:55.299> here<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.430> zero

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
field around here and then up to zero

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.610 
field around here and then up to zero
you'll<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.239> have<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> mono<00:02:58.660> tracks<00:02:59.079> well<00:02:59.349> it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
you'll just have a mono tracks well it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.800 
you'll just have a mono tracks well it's
move<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.400> into<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.670> center<00:03:00.700> position<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.780> as

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
move it into the center position so as

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.420 
move it into the center position so as
if<00:03:02.200> you've<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.470> like<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.650> mono<00:03:02.860> track<00:03:03.160> playing

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
if you've got like a mono track playing

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.699 
if you've got like a mono track playing
this<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.569> be<00:03:04.629> useful<00:03:04.930> if<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.140> don't<00:03:05.349> want<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
this can be useful if you don't want the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.009 
this can be useful if you don't want the
left<00:03:05.920> or<00:03:06.129> right<00:03:06.459> guitar<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.299> playing<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.840> its

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
left or right guitar when playing on its

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.130 
left or right guitar when playing on its
own<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.890> sit<00:03:09.129> far<00:03:09.519> right<00:03:09.910> far<00:03:10.269> left<00:03:10.569> in<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.930> mix

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
own to sit far right far left in the mix

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.350 
own to sit far right far left in the mix
you<00:03:11.739> want<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.980> move<00:03:12.129> it<00:03:12.280> into<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.760> center<00:03:13.180> sort

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
you want to move it into a center sort

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.330 
you want to move it into a center sort
of<00:03:13.420> position<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:13.989> it's<00:03:14.680> not<00:03:14.769> quite<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> sort<00:03:15.280> of

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
of position so it's not quite a sort of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.069 
of position so it's not quite a sort of
jump<00:03:15.670> when<00:03:16.239> you've<00:03:16.329> got<00:03:16.450> headphones<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.900> or<00:03:17.019> if

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
jump when you've got headphones on or if

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.900 
jump when you've got headphones on or if
you're<00:03:17.170> listening<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.500> stereo<00:03:17.769> speakers<00:03:18.190> so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
you're listening with stereo speakers so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.250 
you're listening with stereo speakers so
I'll<00:03:19.000> give<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.239> demonstration<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.049> in

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
I'll give you a demonstration of that in

00:03:20.260 --> 00:04:23.400 
I'll give you a demonstration of that in
a<00:03:20.319> moment
