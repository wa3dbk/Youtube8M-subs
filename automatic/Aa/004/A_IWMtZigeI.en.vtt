 cell phones with windows phone this is 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.289
 this option is available for mobile 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.989
 or this application like the 505 not that 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.779
 as you know is the most basic of the range 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.670
 of the nokia lumia very well and the truth 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.309
 is very complete the application is very 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.010
 efficient let's see the suite options 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.030
 we slide to the left 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.030
 we will find what is the option of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.309
 webcam or if we can now yes that 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.950
 minimize would be like you're not there you can 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.630
 add notes you can climb the stairs 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.820
 and pass them to your computer what 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.250

 sharepoint office 365 phones and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.309
 skydrive the most important of skydrive 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.619
 because that allows us to download the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.229
 documents that we have uploaded to the cloud 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.740
 and open them here or edit it no or vice versa 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.260
 upload one from here to the cloud is not very 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.620
 important this one 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.270
 and finally we have what is 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.000
 create documents that is the most 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.670
 important or what everyone expects from a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.260
 office application be here we have 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.150

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.490
 option to search if we give more 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.320
 will appear if we want to create a document 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.830
 blank some templates that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 we have and only this is not 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.560
 templates let's say the most basic 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.810

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.000
 are let's say that basic no of any 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.460
 way it's going to be the same as in the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.820

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.690
 blank document as in the computer 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.780

 select cells 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.999
 and many more, nothing else is a matter of 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.400
 that you will be bitten the same in 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.379
 power point in the presentations we are going 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.099
 to see horizontally so that 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.709
 let's see the slides better and we'll 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.030
 explain what more or less like this 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.340
 example we can create 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.770
 our slides and more here 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.840
 we have one of the most important or 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.880
 most used for you for the people 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.390
 that goes in primary or secondary that is 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.770
 word when they ask for summaries or not 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.660
 Well, here you can edit it 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.300
 they can move things and they can upload it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.860
 and in the once you print it 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.980
 You can also print it from here 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.880
 it will be seen let's say that way more or 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.310
 less perfectly 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.680
 but it's not the same obviously to edit 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.220
 on a cell phone with a very small screen 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.630
 than on a computer with a monitor 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.270
 big and with all the options 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.960
 available are some 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.960
 options here 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.409
 share and all that do not search and for 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.139
 course of course edit not delete and 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:31.169
