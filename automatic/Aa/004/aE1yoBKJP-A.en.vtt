00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
talked about it quite deeply the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.590 
talked about it quite deeply the
director<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.369> about<00:01:45.759> showing<00:01:46.509> these

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
director and I about showing these

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.750 
director and I about showing these
different<00:01:46.930> sides<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.560> how<00:01:47.770> he's<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.729> know

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
different sides and how he's you know

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.140 
different sides and how he's you know
jealous<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.600> yet<00:01:49.810> fun<00:01:50.590> Raval<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.310> upset<00:01:51.880> and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
jealous and yet fun Raval and upset and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.640 
jealous and yet fun Raval and upset and
torn<00:01:52.450> between<00:01:52.840> these<00:01:53.080> two<00:01:53.260> different<00:01:53.500> paths

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
torn between these two different paths

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.310 
torn between these two different paths
etc<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:54.820> think<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.479> each<00:01:55.570> scene<00:01:55.869> we<00:01:56.080> try<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
etc so I think in each scene we try to

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.960 
etc so I think in each scene we try to
explore<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:57.010> different<00:01:57.040> emotion<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:57.880> you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
explore a different emotion that you

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.039 
explore a different emotion that you
might<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.180> might<00:01:58.299> be<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.659> through<00:01:58.720> so

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
might you might be going through so

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.219 
might you might be going through so
hopefully<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.530> conveys<00:01:59.860> well<00:02:01.020> jenny<00:02:02.020> has<00:02:02.200> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.970 
weird I think it sort of works for it
against<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.470> obviously<00:02:55.890> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
against you that you know obviously I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.460 
against you that you know obviously I
know<00:02:56.070> fan<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.670> Dan<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.330> long<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:58.200> weird

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
know fan of Dan for so long it's weird

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930 
know fan of Dan for so long it's weird
kind<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.830> doing<00:02:59.430> something<00:02:59.700> when<00:02:59.820> you've

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
kind of doing something when you've

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.190 
kind of doing something when you've
known<00:03:00.090> someone<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.570> then<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.050> also

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
known someone but then I think it also

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.420 
known someone but then I think it also
makes<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.800> more<00:03:01.830> comfortable<00:03:02.070> because

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
makes it a bit more comfortable because

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.770 
makes it a bit more comfortable because
it's<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.910> stranger<00:03:03.390> you're<00:03:03.540> having

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's not just a stranger you're having

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.620 
it's not just a stranger you're having
to<00:03:03.870> deal<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.340> no<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> scenes<00:03:05.700> really<00:03:05.970> kind

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
to deal with no the scenes really kind

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.480 
to deal with no the scenes really kind
of<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> film<00:03:07.650> goes<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:08.040> there's<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.400> lot

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
of the as the film goes on there's a lot

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.890 
of the as the film goes on there's a lot
of<00:03:08.580> tension<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:09.030> grows<00:03:09.209> between<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
of tension that grows between them and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
of tension that grows between them and
then<00:03:09.990> finally<00:03:10.680> happen<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.430> it's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
then finally happen so I think it's

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.310 
then finally happen so I think it's
really<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.240> does<00:03:12.540> no<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.959> really<00:03:13.140> exciting

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
really it does no just a really exciting

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.640 
really it does no just a really exciting
