00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
for facebook now i think the problem

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
for facebook now i think the problem
that<00:00:22.199> people<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.830> glove<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.510> actually

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that people have with glove is actually

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.820 
that people have with glove is actually
before<00:00:24.660> they've<00:00:24.930> even<00:00:25.019> tried<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.619> fight

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
before they've even tried to fight

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
before they've even tried to fight
they're<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> mindset<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.449> fight

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
they're just in a mindset that the fight

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
they're just in a mindset that the fight
is<00:00:27.689> still<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.320> same<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.949> 60<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> as

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
is still the same as it was at 60 and as

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
is still the same as it was at 60 and as
it<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.359> 80<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:31.109> while<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> mechanics<00:00:31.890> are

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it was at 80 now while the mechanics are

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
it was at 80 now while the mechanics are
still<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.120> don't

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
still all there a lot of them don't

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
still all there a lot of them don't
really<00:00:33.570> apply<00:00:34.100> especially<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> an<00:00:35.370> arms

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
thing that that glove does is part of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.920 
thing that that glove does is part of
his<00:01:05.970> mechanics<00:01:06.119> there's<00:01:06.630> something<00:01:06.840> called

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
his mechanics there's something called

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.109 
his mechanics there's something called
decimate<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.799> does<00:01:08.040> may<00:01:08.189> takes<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.880> to

decimate now does may takes you down to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
decimate now does may takes you down to
five<00:01:09.960> percent<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.650> maximum<00:01:11.100> health<00:01:11.310> now

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
five percent of your maximum health now

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
five percent of your maximum health now
that<00:01:12.570> brings<00:01:12.900> me<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.470> next<00:01:13.530> point<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that brings me to my next point which is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.999 
that brings me to my next point which is
about<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> zombies<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.780> glove<00:01:16.409> during<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
about the zombies so glove during this

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
about the zombies so glove during this
fight<00:01:17.220> summoned<00:01:17.850> zombies<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
fight summoned zombies now if the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.630 
fight summoned zombies now if the
zombies<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.650> left<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.520> know

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
zombies are left you know

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880 
zombies are left you know
uninterruptedly<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:22.290> basically<00:01:22.619> turn

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
uninterruptedly will basically turn

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
uninterruptedly will basically turn
around<00:01:23.130> eat<00:01:23.340> them<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> gain<00:01:24.240> some<00:01:24.270> health

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
around eat them and gain some health

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.249 
around eat them and gain some health
back<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.729> problem<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.630> people

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
back now the problem with that is people

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.210 
back now the problem with that is people
try<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> chase<00:01:29.340> after<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.790> zombies<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.220> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
try to chase after the zombies and it's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
try to chase after the zombies and it's
really<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> waste<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> amount<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
really a waste of time the amount of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
really a waste of time the amount of
health<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> he's<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:35.040> from

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
health that he's going to get back from

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
health that he's going to get back from
eating<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> zombies<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.540> enough<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
eating the zombies is not enough to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
eating the zombies is not enough to
outweigh<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.770> amount<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.070> damage<00:01:38.400> you're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
outweigh the amount of damage you're

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.160 
outweigh the amount of damage you're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going to do to him so it's better to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
going to do to him so it's better to
just<00:01:40.229> leave<00:01:40.560> him<00:01:40.740> alone<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.159> let<00:01:41.250> him<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.579> and
