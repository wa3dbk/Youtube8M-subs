00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.420
 well we almost started playing drum rhythms but before I have I have 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.430
 that show pays and clarifies a little about the graph that 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.609
 let's use to represent these drum rhythms 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.070
 this graph per hundred is not for them to stop studying how to write and read 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.699
 music is very important that he studied music theory obviously because all the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.149
 books are written in musical notation 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.210
 so 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.850
 it's great to learn but the idea of ​​the graphic will be the ones that are watching 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.920
 this course they are beginners and in general I do not think they can write and 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.150
 read music 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.820
 so not only do I do it for that but because this graphic is a very 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 representative of what are drum rhythms so much 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 sd in the machines of the program rhythms in the machines 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.200
 solid as a r 8 roll of the eighties 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.390
 nor currently cd in programs like flower and luxor these studies is called hour 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.420
 it is represented more or less as is a graph in what is a compass that is 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.360
 what this graphic does 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.400
 this graphic to be on my website to download so they can 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.369
 settle to download 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.219
 in an empty version so you have your own variations of rhythms 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.219
 or in others that are already full then you can download it 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.400
 this the arctic what makes or represent nothing more than me a compass 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.910
 a compass this this graphic will see tarantini 2016 parts in eight parts 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.680
 do not swim a shy m twelve parts with 24 parts 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.640
 yes we divide those twelve parts and in two we will give 600 those six parts in 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.840
 two are going to give us 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.880
 the compass of vido and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.369
 small groups of three sections when we see is their divisions between them 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.869
 rhythms judges type of system we will take them system 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.859
 Hernán Dios and the others that is a thriller with contentment 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.670
 always while two binary posts 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.170
 otherwise to see it more than eloquent it seems less ridiculous to me 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.810
 in a comment already in that YouTube video is to see what is called the pulse 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.040
 that is one thing that I'm soon missing allen a lot in the videos onwards 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.459
 but they'll see more when I talk about compass division or their timid in 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.050
 two or three shovels 2 of that difference but the pulse is therefore very important 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.050
 the pulse is when we have 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:34.779
 quatrocchi is called vidic too but good pulse is very important because 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:39.799
 is when we count in lund 2003 the 4 in very important moments when 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.619
 It is the pulse of the music we have at a party of 79 600 points is not the 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:51.809
 pulse is the pulse when the pulse is subdivided or in two sources that's what 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.349
 not really determination system in binary other nario 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.670
 s good tamayo that is used in three places also very much the term pérez and I 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.959
 I do not know what they're going to see in front 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.569
 that's what you're the one who wanted to clarify because they're going to see those graphics 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.479
 onwards 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.829
 is going to be very well off do not stop studying please draw because you 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.719
 they lose many books that at the end of this course I will recommend
