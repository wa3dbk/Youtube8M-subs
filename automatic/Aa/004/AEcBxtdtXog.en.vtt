00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.809
 will you do a little tutorial on saÃ´ne 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 and vegas pro come to make an effect a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.850
 effort of writing computers to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.430
 keyboard on your on a video on a 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.869
 editing for something like that so everything 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 right away we create a good video 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 So we did it because we'll right-click 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 tightened a plain text media the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 video media generator titled text 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.160
 d sony so we have our texts 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 model can be deleted right away 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 just no so we're going to animate for the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.809
 guinea we put our text how you 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.809
 chose the writing font 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.280
 at worst we do not care about the police 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.320
 culture we will stay like this so here 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.540
 we click on the little clock has 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.780
 up 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 once it's done you can see 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.899
 that down here there is a time bar 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.009
 2 follows so the little gray bar is 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.530
 at the bottom it shows you to your 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.930
 text how it is and in bone and for 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.880
 put the inks in fact it's for 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 to say when does that do that to what 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.149
 moment and that's how we go 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.800
 at 0 here we come there is actually a shot 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.660
 is 8 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:13.000
 the shot and 18 c to make style is by 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:13.900
 example a very good right we'll leave 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.239
 on the shooting at eighteen o'clock finally 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.410
 attracted 2.8 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.410
 then we take the small cursor and we 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.040
 advance a little bit we withdraw the shot is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.870
 of 8 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.060
 finally me in my text we advance 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 still a little bit 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.700
 8 we advance removing the dash of 8 May 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.930
 another letter so what are you doing 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 this especially your text we advance a 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.320
 power I have not very very accurate 1 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.459
 it's good you know if you want 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.470
 really made precision and that you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.970
 click on the funny little thing and that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.989
 the arrows you can play you 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.600
 can you tell my text 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.269
 in the interval of three 3 arrows to 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:05.769
 every time I do 1 2 3 so I do 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:08.579
 one two three communes m limit on 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.579
 advance a little bit 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:21.599
 we advance a space killing eight men 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.599
 before his flight 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.349
 ok so the text is finished good 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.359
 maybe add something to make a 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.790
 effect actually you do continue you 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.299
 come on there you go ahead again and you 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.090
 made so small 8 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.150
 it is a space drawn at 2.8 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.519
 you go in time to withdraw 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 your tirade of eight of advanced you the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:16.220
 put back as if she was waiting then 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.739
 I will show you a second 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.000
 truction on the sphere a little bit short 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.060
 can be something that can be nice 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.229
 for those who do disassembly it's 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.150
 with the color of the text in time to 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.770
 do the same thing but with the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.690
 colors earth we will change the 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.930
 colors as time goes by 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.180
 for example the text that will start at 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.060
 click on the little animated thing the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.830
 textile will start by being white 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.240
 then I do not know I want to 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.060
 this place the hand of the requirements of 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.229
 dyed color you come here you 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.229
 change the color you put red 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:54.919
 by advancing that we want to change the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.099
 color on me clusan rose migiro 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.050
 we move forward we move back because the pain 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:04.130
 but for want to switch in the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 blue went into the blues then we 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:12.139
 wants to change even tian of the world before 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.789
 we want to put a little bit of 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.699
 numbers one advance the text ends in 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:25.130
 day and then after hop it comes back white 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:27.110
 to the wide choice of each and the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.699
 colors then you want good 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.919

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:39.650
 media library switchers or at the beginning and in 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:45.050
 keep it's not great but it's 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.229
 for an intro that we can not day it 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.830
