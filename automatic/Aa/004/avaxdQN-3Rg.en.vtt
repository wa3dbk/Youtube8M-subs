00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 good afternoon friends my name is alexei and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 we continue to play no 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.790
 brought up ground first in our turn 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.840
 drag racing which is called the most 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.019
 powerful engine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.849
 i don't really know what's waiting here 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 try just take a look at chelen's house 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 eyes and know look him so i type you 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.090
 I will pass 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.580
 ok so i actually have this track moon 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 I remember and quite true as I wanted 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.140
 to remember but I remember so long ago and now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 of course still remember where here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 is, roughly speaking, greenbacks 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.040
 Arrow everywhere population further 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 so that I could generally take and carefully 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 ah tyzh damn big beard big baron 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 how much can you come on come on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.600
 greens greens and greener greens all 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 I can usually do it anyway 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.500
 carefully oh you nifiga just torpedo 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 torpedo winner 24 seconds and 22 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.309
 hundredths and we are in first place with very 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.289
 a good margin for the driver with them 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.070
 naturally vinyl 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.740
 magazine to you and 700 all our bucks you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.260
 added -1 race 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 so we have another one so all on 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.710
 in fact, already three circles this pleases and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.150
 another drag racing then called 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 King Dragana is probably by the way 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.090
 speaking and there will be in general a battle for 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 primacy of such discipline as treating 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.979
 but let's probably now we have 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.930
 how many in Yandex taxi search four 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 race one two three four we are confused 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.299
 it will be 110 racing right on and there 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 there is still one of the coolest hands 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.290
 let's take the guys probably a circle like that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.970
 just funny this is nascut here and come 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 time to meet kurt one-on-one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.720
 to win first place in the table 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.149
 circular racing seems to be cool 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.479
 very fun but I really don't know at all 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.100
 how else can this be commented out general 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.159
 just divine now really 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.869
 will i think we have more words just 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.200
 with fuel as I don't know anyone because he 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.560
 just a sucker we have the coolest car in 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.030
 the game 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.549
 well at least for me on this one 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.140
 stage and we have only three laps and i 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.520
 I think that this is not a reason for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.549
 to test yourself once and for all 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.319
 let's just go ahead and not 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.890
 look back because i don't want 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.410
 back generally look now so scary 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.239
 drove perfectly ok in general cultures he 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 buy already goes far behind us 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.680
 excuse me of course for the expression but he 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.209
 most zalyutsya is now more 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.220
 no way can I describe it now and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.459
 only if he doesn't cheat like 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.959
 once did it raise only in such 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.319
 case will probably be able to defeat us 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.230
 because I'm just in hell now 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.280
 indicators of goodwill are and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.989
 after that race for seven laps 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.610
 unfortunately find me not at all scary 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.129
 I know this now 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.739
 such nihilists that is, and I am not a pacifist 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.440
 I do not care for me to know this and coffee will be 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.200
 boss compared and constantly imagine everything and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.269
 always it turns out 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.910
 god after real after that race 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.680
 it seems to me even a damn thing is more complicated 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.010
 there can be no truth here it was that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.420
 race to know which eliminates the full 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.579
 nubas well here roughly those who what 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.260
 this may be a sin and drove the carcass 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.819
 double did not pass tula on you 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.069
 we will not strain here please 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.319
 finish this game and tell your friends 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.180
 what have you done the program and if you don’t 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.520
 went well sorry so then 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.080
 staying like that okay okay 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240
 the more so by the way this time she 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.520
 I am, in principle, very familiar 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.860
 quite familiar we ourselves once 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.750
 drove there 90 pretty well and by the way 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.970
 saying kurt, as you can see 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.680
 he didn’t do with a finger at last 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.510
 something to somehow get ahead but 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.700
 we have already gone to the third round and I consider it 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.160
 well, of course it's my personal opinion that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.570
 kurt can't damn us 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.950
 to contrast that is what he is just 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.020
 will not have time to fight forward and 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 I hope to defeat us at least 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.380
 least I will generally cling to it 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.790
 probably with all their fibers of the soul and 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.880
 hours of your skin or 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.240
 or vice versa, I don't really know everything 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.730
 this 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.540
 indian and or even indian horseradish 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.470
 never delved 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.720
 why not at all I said ok now 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.250
 so in general it is we have become from all 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.800
 incredibly especially by the way guys 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.690
 it 's also just overgrown with challenge for 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.620
 ourselves because he is also on the Mazda 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.840
 rx7 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.300
 and we just had to wipe his nose 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.480
 mine in front of the car in general, all Kurt 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.480
 you 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.620
 you fucking them all no second already 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.090
 it won't be easy here and let's watch 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.430
 probably now there will be some movie I 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.259
 I do not know the truth I just guess more 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.830
 again I did not reach the time you 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.080
 there are never any guys 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.460
 was not and let's get what you have next 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.620
 you have fights to give kept him 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.530
 rose so above 2 you do not jump 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:59.060
 ok so this is ours who is our king 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.069
 dredge message from the tone if there is 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.060
 you need skill to win 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.699
 tones in this race 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.210
 hurt his midi or be defeated 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.889
 defeated gentlemen okay yes then let's 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.800
 I think now we will still pull this guy 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.990
 and probably I think two bosses principle 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.900
 this series should be enough for me 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.810
 and although guys this asshole as you see he 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.770
 he points 0 go out against you alone on 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.810
 one as you can see and therefore probably us 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.770
 it is necessary now a little so carefully 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.220
 where are we 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.700
 the arrow turns green here about 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.290
 green is fine so there is no race 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.150
 in fact now it's really dangerous 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.060
 As you know, a certain race really doesn't pass. 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.860
 for some reason we didn’t want us now 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.350
 translate to seems more right 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.440
 lane don't know why just us there 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.300
 the game did not let so okay 3 stars 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.090
 the case is okay let's go means 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.370
 just centered on 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.590
 maneuver and and everything on its received 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.150
 so nitrogen given nitrogen beautiful 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.220
 high speed adventure 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.720
 important fine switching we are all 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.630
 more so far we will not press anything 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.610
 Here again Picasso made and here 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.710
 For some reason, I wanted to appear on the left and 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.170
 us just for the rule in flight account 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.260
 guys no no ancestors know why just 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.300
 stopped 3 okay, let's go and 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.580
 repair is just really in the middle 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.020
 just just maneuvering and all i am 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.390
 I think that for us the principle is all 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.010
 succeed let's even do just 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.070
 some good switch think on this 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.500
 with you too we can principle with him 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.960
 the main thing here is real just now yes 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.820
 what is why I did not let me go for 5 hours 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.220
 to the left why am I not here anywhere at all 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.360
 they let you in there just know that 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.280
 feeling as if they did not give up here 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.280
 certain cult crawled down this 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.550
 the second gave the third and now go on it 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.450
 have traffic means no luck no traffic 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.060
 you are lucky 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.740
 the only way 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.160
 so beautiful adventures fast 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.110
 switching so good switching and 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.900
 all yes more on yet give nothing 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.870
 so fine so let's go straight 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.110
 right now oh god 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:09.980
 already be really afraid already 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.980
 see what happens next 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.979
 so they just had time for it 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.870
 although guys though we could now on 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.110
 really just at the finish 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.060
 bump into that frost 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.250
 peace 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.069
 of course you have time to rest a loser so 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.569
 you added your bank 3706 bucks you from 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.569
 us to and satisfied well now we 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:34.729
 the first mode in the bank fights and then 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:37.280
 understands cool so continue to look 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:39.379
 so we look that we still have so 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.659
 they themselves are drifting and champion on 2 kings 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:44.240
 and the top of the sprint that is how you see it 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:46.400
 we really have the last two races on 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.560
 your this last step is called two 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.879
 their disciplines we'll go through already 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.889
 the next series on this I say goodbye 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:55.029
 swami was alexey thanks for watching 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.029
 see you soon
