one which means it doesn't hug in as

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.250 
one which means it doesn't hug in as
much<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.399> still<00:00:44.579> wonderful<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:46.140> it's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
much but it's still wonderful and it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.889 
much but it's still wonderful and it's
really<00:00:46.649> easy<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.129> work<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.789> circular<00:00:48.539> needles

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really easy to work on circular needles

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.920 
really easy to work on circular needles
or<00:00:49.530> double<00:00:49.980> points<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
or double points so you just have to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.150 
or double points so you just have to
make<00:00:52.079> sure<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> total<00:00:52.710> number<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
make sure that the total number of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
make sure that the total number of
stitches<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:53.969> working<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.449> is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
stitches that you're working on is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.369 
stitches that you're working on is
divisible<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.469> 4<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.730> knit<00:00:57.300> 2<00:00:57.510> purl<00:00:57.539> 2<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
divisible by 4 because knit 2 purl 2 is

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.029 
divisible by 4 because knit 2 purl 2 is
a<00:00:58.440> 4<00:00:59.039> stitch<00:00:59.430> repeat<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.719> I'm<00:01:00.870> working<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> 36

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
a 4 stitch repeat so I'm working on 36

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.729 
a 4 stitch repeat so I'm working on 36
stitches<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> divisible<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.750> 4<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
stitches which is divisible by 4 so I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
stitches which is divisible by 4 so I
know<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> everything<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> work

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
know that everything is going to work

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.190 
know that everything is going to work
out<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.689> fine

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
out just fine

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.580 
out just fine
so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.820> started<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.299> round<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.380> where

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so I have started my round here where

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
so I have started my round here where
you<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> tail<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.610> often<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you see the tail I often just use the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.340 
you see the tail I often just use the
tail<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.590> an<00:01:14.369> end<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> round<00:01:15.030> marker<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
tail as an end of round marker because I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.690 
tail as an end of round marker because I
think<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> obvious<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
think it's pretty obvious when it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
think it's pretty obvious when it's
coming<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> I've<00:01:19.080> done<00:01:19.350> two<00:01:19.950> knit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
coming up and I've done two knit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.969 
coming up and I've done two knit
stitches<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.270> purl<00:01:21.600> stitches<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.350> you're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
stitches and two purl stitches if you're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.219 
stitches and two purl stitches if you're
learning<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> read<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:24.060> work<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.049> can

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
learning to read your work then you can

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
learning to read your work then you can
see<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.040> knit<00:01:26.220> stitches<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> V

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
see that the knit stitches are like a V

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530 
see that the knit stitches are like a V
and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.439> purl<00:01:28.680> stitches<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> bump<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and the purl stitches are like a bump so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
and the purl stitches are like a bump so
because<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.020> finished<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.829> bumps<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because I've just finished two bumps I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
because I've just finished two bumps I
know<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.060> ready<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.680> I'm

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.300 
Pearlstein it's so I'm going to continue
around<00:02:03.039> like<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.549> as<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:03.939> talk<00:02:04.360> about<00:02:05.220> sort<00:02:06.220> of

around like that as I talk about sort of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.430 
around like that as I talk about sort of
the<00:02:06.399> pros<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.789> cons<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.299> knit<00:02:08.050> 2<00:02:08.200> purl<00:02:08.229> 2

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the pros and cons of knit 2 purl 2

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680 
the pros and cons of knit 2 purl 2

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.440 
versus knit 1 purl 1
like<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.200> mentioned<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.910> downside<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
like I mentioned the the downside of

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
like I mentioned the the downside of
knit<00:02:13.720> 2<00:02:13.840> purl<00:02:13.870> 2<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.010> not<00:02:15.130> quite<00:02:15.550> as

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
knit 2 purl 2 is that it's not quite as

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.550 
knit 2 purl 2 is that it's not quite as
elastic<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.780> could<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.050> good<00:02:17.319> thing

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
elastic but that could be a good thing

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.780 
elastic but that could be a good thing

that I only have to switch the yarn

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.289 
that I only have to switch the yarn
between<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:38.410> every<00:02:38.860> every<00:02:39.310> second<00:02:39.910> stitch<00:02:40.000> as

knit<00:02:43.269> 1<00:02:43.450> purl<00:02:43.480> 1<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.200> have<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.590> knit<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.099> stitch

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
knit 1 purl 1 I have to knit a stitch

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.160 
knit 1 purl 1 I have to knit a stitch
move<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.910> yarn<00:02:46.030> purl<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.599> stitch<00:02:46.780> move<00:02:47.079> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
move the yarn purl the stitch move a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.030 
move the yarn purl the stitch move a
yarn<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.819> do<00:02:48.940> knit<00:02:49.269> 2<00:02:49.450> purl<00:02:49.480> 2<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.319> can

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
yarn but when I do knit 2 purl 2 I can

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.370 
yarn but when I do knit 2 purl 2 I can
make<00:02:51.400> two<00:02:51.610> stitches<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.299> move<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.019> yarn<00:02:53.109> and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
make two stitches and move the yarn and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.990 
make two stitches and move the yarn and
then<00:02:53.470> make<00:02:53.680> two<00:02:53.890> stitches<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.519> move<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.819> yarn

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
then make two stitches and move the yarn

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.819 
then make two stitches and move the yarn
so<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.840> don't<00:02:56.109> have<00:02:56.260> quite<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:56.709> many

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
so you don't have quite as many

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.949 
so you don't have quite as many
opportunities<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.790> either<00:02:57.940> forget<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.810> move

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
opportunities to either forget to move

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.920 
opportunities to either forget to move
the<00:02:59.109> yarn<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.859> do<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.069> wrong<00:03:00.630> or<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the yarn or to do it wrong or just to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.199 
the yarn or to do it wrong or just to
have<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.079> take<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.650> millisecond<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.609> you

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
have to take the millisecond that you

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.069 
have to take the millisecond that you
know<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:04.510> does<00:03:04.690> add<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:04.959> over<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.950> project<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.690> I

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
know it does add up over a project so I

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.890 
know it does add up over a project so I
am<00:03:09.180> approaching<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.840> end<00:03:11.470> here<00:03:12.040> I've<00:03:12.609> got<00:03:12.900> two

to watch that end of round come up you

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.020 
to watch that end of round come up you
could<00:03:38.889> just<00:03:39.040> keep<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.519> till<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:39.850> long

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030
