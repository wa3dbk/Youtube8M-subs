leak<00:01:45.380> other<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> seems<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> be

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
leak other than that it seems to be

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.240 
leak other than that it seems to be
holding<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.180> fine<00:01:50.450> because<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
holding up just fine because see it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
holding up just fine because see it
squirting<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.990> yeah<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
squirting out right there yeah just a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
squirting out right there yeah just a
little<00:01:55.350> leak<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> JV<00:01:56.670> well

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
little leak it's actually in the JV well

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
little leak it's actually in the JV well
so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> sand<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> put<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.259> top<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so I can sand it and put on top and it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
so I can sand it and put on top and it
should<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.920> fine<00:01:59.189> oil<00:02:00.030> pressure<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.390> those

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
should be fine oil pressure on those

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
should be fine oil pressure on those
things<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.049> about<00:02:01.170> 55<00:02:01.680> pounds<00:02:02.159> all

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
things pretty good about 55 pounds all

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
things pretty good about 55 pounds all
the<00:02:02.520> time<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.969> gauge<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> messed<00:02:04.290> up

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the time that gauge is kind of messed up

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.160 
the time that gauge is kind of messed up
it<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> sticks<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> tap<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> with

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it kind of sticks do you tap it with

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.490 
it kind of sticks do you tap it with
something<00:02:07.409> it'll<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.840> flat<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
something it'll go back down flat on it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.260 
something it'll go back down flat on it
looks<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:10.920> cleaner<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.700> like

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
looks a lot cleaner in here now I like

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.290 
looks a lot cleaner in here now I like
it's<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.599> easier<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.870> work<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.379> now

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's much easier to work in it now

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
it's much easier to work in it now
but<00:02:15.300> um<00:02:15.510> try<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> find<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> thermostat<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
but um try to find a thermostat that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.200 
but um try to find a thermostat that
water<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.490> doesn't<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> thermostat

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
water and it doesn't have a thermostat

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.060 
water and it doesn't have a thermostat
and<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.720> thought<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.530> supposed<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.010> a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
and I thought it's supposed to have a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.560 
and I thought it's supposed to have a
thermostat<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.520> could<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:20.970> wrong<00:02:21.150> somebody

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
thermostat I could be wrong somebody

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.450 
thermostat I could be wrong somebody
knows<00:02:21.750> better<00:02:21.960> please<00:02:22.680> correct<00:02:23.010> me<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:26.220> far<00:02:26.400> as

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
knows better please correct me as far as

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.770 
knows better please correct me as far as
I<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.790> should<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> thermostat<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
I know it should have a thermostat to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.940 
I know it should have a thermostat to
maintain<00:02:28.220> engine<00:02:29.220> temperature<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.800> like

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
maintain engine temperature so but like

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.080 
maintain engine temperature so but like
I<00:02:32.070> said<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.280> could<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.580> wrong<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.000> that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
I said I could be wrong because that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.240 
I said I could be wrong because that
that<00:02:33.450> fan<00:02:33.720> does<00:02:33.930> Drive<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that fan does Drive all the time it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
that fan does Drive all the time it
doesn't<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> clutch<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.810> would

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
doesn't have a clutch on it so I would

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.240 
doesn't have a clutch on it so I would
think<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> regulate<00:02:37.770> temperature<00:02:37.890> you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
think that to regulate temperature you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180 
think that to regulate temperature you
need<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> thermostat<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> change<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
need a thermostat but I change the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490 
need a thermostat but I change the
engine<00:02:41.430> speed<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.180> was<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.450> 1,800<00:02:42.960> rpm<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
engine speed it was at 1,800 rpm for the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.980 
engine speed it was at 1,800 rpm for the
last<00:02:43.680> generator<00:02:44.100> head<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.910> was<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.360> but

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
last generator head that was on it but

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.800 
last generator head that was on it but
the<00:02:46.110> one<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> rated<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.700> 3600<00:02:48.450> rpm

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the one I have is rated it at 3600 rpm

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.770 
the one I have is rated it at 3600 rpm
so<00:02:49.080> I'm<00:02:49.140> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> belt<00:02:50.310> drive<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.660> two

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
so I'm going to belt drive it one two

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.070 
so I'm going to belt drive it one two
three<00:02:51.810> ratio<00:02:52.740> rung<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.970> 1200<00:02:54.480> rpm<00:02:54.840> this

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
three ratio rung is about 1200 rpm this

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.770 
three ratio rung is about 1200 rpm this
engine<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.520> belt<00:02:57.330> drive<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:57.750> to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
engine and then a belt drive it up to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.650 
engine and then a belt drive it up to
3600<00:02:58.530> rpm<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> head<00:02:59.240> and<00:03:00.240> I'm<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
3600 rpm on the head and I'm going to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.910 
3600 rpm on the head and I'm going to
see<00:03:00.810> how<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.080> runs<00:03:01.290> because<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.590> mean<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:01.860> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
see how that runs because I mean it's a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.050 
see how that runs because I mean it's a
22<00:03:02.250> horsepower<00:03:02.670> engine<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.570> or<00:03:03.660> less<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
22 horsepower engine more or less and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.600 
22 horsepower engine more or less and
the<00:03:06.560> generator<00:03:07.560> head<00:03:07.680> only<00:03:07.800> requires<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.310> seven

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the generator head only requires a seven

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.270 
the generator head only requires a seven
horsepower<00:03:08.850> engine<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.230> think<00:03:10.470> even<00:03:10.800> at<00:03:10.920> at

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
horsepower engine and I think even at at

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.920 
horsepower engine and I think even at at
idle<00:03:11.700> speed<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.060> thing<00:03:12.120> puts<00:03:12.480> out<00:03:12.600> eight

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
idle speed this thing puts out eight

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.040 
idle speed this thing puts out eight
horsepower<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.810> think<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.900> should<00:03:16.020> be

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
horsepower so I think it should be

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.400 
horsepower so I think it should be
plenty<00:03:16.730> but<00:03:17.730> we'll<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.600> only<00:03:18.810> test<00:03:19.110> will<00:03:19.260> see

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
plenty but we'll see only test will see

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.750 
plenty but we'll see only test will see
only<00:03:20.070> test<00:03:20.250> will<00:03:20.400> tell<00:03:22.340> that's<00:03:23.340> really<00:03:23.640> all<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
only test will tell that's really all I

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
only test will tell that's really all I
did<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.420> evolved<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.170> don't<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.470> if<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
did I just evolved I don't know if I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.290 
did I just evolved I don't know if I
said<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> last<00:03:26.070> video<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.790> pulled

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
said that in the last video but I pulled

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.729 
said that in the last video but I pulled
the<00:03:27.390> valve<00:03:27.570> cover<00:03:27.810> off<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> valves

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the valve cover off just to the valves

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.410 
the valve cover off just to the valves
they<00:03:29.130> weren't<00:03:29.340> bad<00:03:29.550> they<00:03:29.790> were<00:03:29.850> they<00:03:30.180> were<00:03:30.239> out

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
they weren't bad they were they were out

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.009 
they weren't bad they were they were out
of<00:03:30.450> spec<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:31.410> weren't<00:03:31.650> too<00:03:32.040> too<00:03:32.220> bad<00:03:33.019> so

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
of spec but they weren't too too bad so

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.020 
of spec but they weren't too too bad so
I<00:03:34.080> got<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.590> spec<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.730> seems<00:03:35.910> to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
I got all that in spec and it seems to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.699 
I got all that in spec and it seems to
start<00:03:36.180> up<00:03:36.360> good<00:03:36.510> now<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.380> continues

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
start up good now and you know continues

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.780 
start up good now and you know continues
to<00:03:37.800> run<00:03:37.890> good<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.190> sounds<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.610> runs

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to run good it sounds like it runs

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.229 
to run good it sounds like it runs
smoother<00:03:40.340> sounds<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> lot<00:03:41.489> more<00:03:41.550> like<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> diesel

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
smoother sounds a lot more like a diesel

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.060 
smoother sounds a lot more like a diesel
you<00:03:42.390> know<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.540> hear<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.680> knocking

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
you know you hear that that knocking

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.370 
you know you hear that that knocking
sound<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.489> bit<00:03:44.730> not<00:03:45.660> knocking<00:03:46.170> knocking

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
sound a little bit not knocking knocking

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.770 
sound a little bit not knocking knocking
but<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.310> sound<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> diesels<00:03:48.300> make<00:03:50.780> what

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
but just sound the diesels make what

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.090 
but just sound the diesels make what
else<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.140> got<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.380> redo<00:03:52.590> those<00:03:52.739> battery

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
else I got to redo those battery

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.560 
else I got to redo those battery
connections<00:03:53.580> those<00:03:53.820> terminals<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.390> this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
connections those terminals there this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.440 
connections those terminals there this
positive<00:03:55.050> smokes<00:03:55.410> when<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.650> crank<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.450> notice

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
positive smokes when I crank it I notice

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.090 
positive smokes when I crank it I notice
that<00:03:57.600> there's<00:03:58.050> not<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.260> very<00:03:58.500> good<00:03:58.620> crimp<00:03:58.950> on

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
that there's not a very good crimp on

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.170 
that there's not a very good crimp on
there<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.670> I'm<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.090> about

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
there so I'm going to see about

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.920 
there so I'm going to see about
soldering<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.080> or<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:03.540> putting<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> on

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
soldering it or just just putting it on

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.320 
soldering it or just just putting it on
there<00:04:04.140> better<00:04:04.820> don't<00:04:05.820> look<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.030> those<00:04:06.209> are

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
there better don't look like those are

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.910 
there better don't look like those are
the<00:04:06.390> original<00:04:06.480> terminals<00:04:07.170> probably<00:04:07.769> how<00:04:07.860> to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
the original terminals probably how to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.420 
the original terminals probably how to
top<00:04:08.700> Post<00:04:08.970> terminals<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.140> somebody<00:04:10.410> just<00:04:11.250> had

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
top Post terminals and somebody just had

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.910 
top Post terminals and somebody just had
a<00:04:11.459> battery<00:04:11.700> laying<00:04:11.970> around<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.299> put<00:04:12.420> those<00:04:12.540> on

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
a battery laying around and put those on

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.729 
a battery laying around and put those on
so<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.900> should<00:04:15.900> be<00:04:15.989> about<00:04:16.200> it

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
so I should be about it

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.009 
so I should be about it
I<00:04:16.769> put<00:04:17.459> some<00:04:17.609> fuel<00:04:17.729> system<00:04:18.120> cleaner<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.690> see

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
I put some fuel system cleaner in it see

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.330 
I put some fuel system cleaner in it see
if<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.140> can<00:04:19.260> clean<00:04:19.440> up<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> injectors<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.070> little

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
if I can clean up the injectors a little

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.969 
if I can clean up the injectors a little
bit<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.669> kind<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.030> maintenance<00:04:21.560> some<00:04:22.560> power

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
bit just kind of maintenance some power

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.440 
bit just kind of maintenance some power
service<00:04:23.400> diesel<00:04:23.729> clean<00:04:23.910> that's<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.150> good<00:04:24.330> stuff

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
service diesel clean that's a good stuff

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.420 
service diesel clean that's a good stuff
but<00:04:25.840> not<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.620> best<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.950> mean<00:04:26.980> I'm<00:04:27.160> sure<00:04:27.310> it's

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
but not the best I mean I'm sure it's

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.730 
but not the best I mean I'm sure it's
not<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.610> best<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:27.880> that's<00:04:28.180> what<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.720> prefer

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
not the best but that's what I prefer

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.710 
not the best but that's what I prefer
seems<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.430> work<00:04:30.460> pretty<00:04:30.580> well<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.480> cheap

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
seems to work pretty well and it's cheap

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.250 
seems to work pretty well and it's cheap
so<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:34.060> can<00:04:34.210> see<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.480> runs<00:04:34.720> pretty<00:04:34.930> good<00:04:35.140> it's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
so you can see it runs pretty good it's

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.080 
so you can see it runs pretty good it's
dirty<00:04:35.410> hot<00:04:35.620> now<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.340> mean<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.760> starts<00:04:37.000> up

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
dirty hot now but I mean it starts up

00:04:37.090 --> 00:05:02.030 
dirty hot now but I mean it starts up
great

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040
