00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.880 
map you will get lots of kills because
everyone<00:01:46.090> more<00:01:46.329> or<00:01:46.420> less<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:47.469> that<00:01:47.679> close

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
everyone more or less is that close

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.760 
everyone more or less is that close
range<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.869> that'd<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.200> pretty<00:01:50.320> sweet<00:01:50.499> alright

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
range so that'd be pretty sweet alright

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.429 
range so that'd be pretty sweet alright
nice<00:01:51.009> where<00:01:51.969> are<00:01:52.060> they<00:01:52.149> spawning<00:01:52.479> now<00:01:52.719> so<00:01:53.320> at

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
nice where are they spawning now so at

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.130 
nice where are they spawning now so at
this<00:01:53.499> point<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.890> other<00:01:54.009> side<00:01:55.140> where's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
this point of the other side where's

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.069 
this point of the other side where's
this<00:01:56.200> guy<00:01:56.380> out<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:58.240> we<00:01:58.329> go<00:01:58.450> awesome<00:01:58.929> I'm

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
this guy out there we go awesome I'm

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.300 
this guy out there we go awesome I'm
trying<00:01:59.289> to<00:01:59.380> build<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.770> streak<00:02:00.100> at<00:02:00.219> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
trying to build up a streak at the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.899 
trying to build up a streak at the
moment<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.560> staying<00:02:02.560> alive<00:02:02.859> I<00:02:03.039> suppose<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.670> my

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
moment so staying alive I suppose is my

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.480 
moment so staying alive I suppose is my
first<00:02:04.179> priority<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.920> right

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
first priority all right

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.850 
first priority all right
so<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> Judas<00:02:08.390> don't<00:02:08.569> know<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.810> wasn't<00:02:09.140> sea<00:02:09.739> as

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so the Judas don't know it wasn't sea as

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.260 
so the Judas don't know it wasn't sea as
you<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:10.069> see<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> spawns<00:02:10.520> keep<00:02:10.759> are<00:02:11.000> pretty

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
you can see the spawns keep are pretty

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.360 
you can see the spawns keep are pretty
much<00:02:11.420> flipping<00:02:11.810> back<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.050> forth<00:02:12.290> which<00:02:13.160> is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
much flipping back and forth which is

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.479 
much flipping back and forth which is
what<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> like<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.599> map<00:02:14.840> if<00:02:15.280> anything<00:02:16.280> oh<00:02:16.430> I

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
right time to regen some health as you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250 
right time to regen some health as you
see<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.580> guy<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:25.790> crept<00:02:26.300> up<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.660> us<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.959> towel

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
see that guy just crept up on us a towel

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.059 
see that guy just crept up on us a towel
easy<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.700> our<00:02:28.910> spawn<00:02:29.690> by<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
easy they can our spawn by you so you

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.320 
easy they can our spawn by you so you
might<00:02:31.220> as<00:02:31.310> well<00:02:31.340> head<00:02:31.580> down<00:02:31.700> over<00:02:31.880> here<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.209> we

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
might as well head down over here now we

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.360 
might as well head down over here now we
might<00:02:32.510> get<00:02:32.630> killed<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.410> guess<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.130> all<00:02:34.250> in

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
might get killed but I guess it's all in

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.740 
might get killed but I guess it's all in
the<00:02:34.459> experience<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.060> I've<00:02:35.360> been<00:02:35.480> played<00:02:35.720> too

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the experience so I've been played too

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.900 
the experience so I've been played too
much<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> map<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.830> played<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.459> once<00:02:37.610> for

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
much of the map I played it once for

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970 
much of the map I played it once for
about<00:02:38.150> two<00:02:38.360> minutes<00:02:38.569> because<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.769> game

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
about two minutes because then the game

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.699 
about two minutes because then the game
was<00:02:40.220> about<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.700> end<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> my<00:02:42.230> experience<00:02:42.620> on

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
was about to end so my experience on

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.590 
was about to end so my experience on
this<00:02:42.769> map<00:02:43.010> isn't<00:02:43.310> as<00:02:43.640> good<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:44.540> I'm

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
this map isn't as good but what I'm

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.539 
this map isn't as good but what I'm
going<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.750> say<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.170> using<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> bowel<00:02:46.190> or<00:02:46.459> a

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
going to say is using the bowel or a

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.850 
going to say is using the bowel or a
fast<00:02:47.330> firing<00:02:47.750> weapon<00:02:48.230> that's<00:02:48.350> good<00:02:48.560> at<00:02:48.680> close

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
fast firing weapon that's good at close

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.280 
fast firing weapon that's good at close
range<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.180> dominate<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.810> map<00:02:51.049> like

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
range is going to dominate this map like

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.710 
range is going to dominate this map like

this bad boy in time to run away before
I<00:03:20.150> die<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:20.989> want<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.230> my<00:03:21.350> warbird<00:03:21.970> war

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
I die so I want to get my warbird war

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.300 
I die so I want to get my warbird war
bet<00:03:23.150> there<00:03:23.329> we<00:03:23.420> go<00:03:23.540> let's<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.440> how<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.799> rocks

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
bet there we go let's see how this rocks

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.970 
bet there we go let's see how this rocks
and<00:03:25.670> rock<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.780> roll's<00:03:26.959> almost<00:03:27.709> said<00:03:27.859> that

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
and rock and roll's almost said that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.310 
and rock and roll's almost said that
wrong<00:03:28.160> but<00:03:28.489> I'm<00:03:28.640> guessing<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.900> warbird

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
wrong but I'm guessing that the warbird

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.310 
wrong but I'm guessing that the warbird
should<00:03:30.709> go<00:03:30.980> ham<00:03:31.930> because<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.290> a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
should go ham because this is a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.300 
should go ham because this is a
close-range<00:03:33.769> map<00:03:34.070> I'm<00:03:34.220> really<00:03:34.430> hoping<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.850> is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
close-range map I'm really hoping it is
