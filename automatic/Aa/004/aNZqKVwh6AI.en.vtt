00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 one dies of self-grown zucchini 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 artificial brain and german researchers 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
 make a new record on that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.170
 only three of the five topics in the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.170
 Clicks for top five news 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.100
 in a gravel or a quarry 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.650
 you will find a lot about the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.350
 day distributed in hanover was found now 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.520
 something very unusual dinosaur 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.590
 fußabdrücke 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
 who has not been a kid once before 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.320
 desired traces of dinos to find 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.020
 or bones 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.760
 it was already adventurous re tracks 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.010
 or similar found 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.350
 the scientists in the quarry 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.510
 in rehburg-loccum more than 90 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.670
 has discovered footprints is probably a 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.309
 wish for a child came true like 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.199
 you have to be big at such 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.600
 Imprint introduce the found there 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.640
 have a diameter of say and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.890
 write more than a meter 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.960
 this extraordinary fund should now 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.239
 be protected quote those are the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 last long-necked dinosaur in this one 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.679
 region we only have this one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.870
 track found and want to try the 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.850
 to get prints on the spot so annette 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.450
 judge from the Lower Saxony 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.010
 Hanover State Museum new record 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 Scientists have managed one 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.820
 Superconductivity at minus 70 degrees Celsius 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.740
 make 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.510
 this is almost the case for the researchers 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.340
 room temperature before the German 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.530
 researchers were successful in the record 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.050
 temperature at minus 100 9 degrees celsius 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 a superconductor stands out 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.460
 from that he has no electrical 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.440
 Resistance meant for the current 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.930
 that he just glides through it 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.840
 can register without any loss 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.070
 to have in the journal nature 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 they published their findings 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 they practiced hydrogen sulfide h2s 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 a huge pressure from the pressure 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.290
 had an intensity of 1.5 million 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.510
 Atmosphere for us lay an absolutely 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.150
 unknown magnitude but it was up 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.090
 in each case very much of one 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.920
 superconductor at room temperature, then 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.360
 really room temperature does its job 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.660
 However, the researchers always dream 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.620
 but still minus 70 degrees that is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.769
 finally a temperature 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.170
 here on the earth sometimes comes before 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.569
 So it's actually a small one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.640
 way to do it and great management 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.980
 you know that maybe one is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.319
 huge technological progress 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.680
 So it is possible stream over long 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.959
 stretch lossless transport 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.409
 we waste much less energy for 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.629
 the transport animal photographers give themselves 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.640
 always try their models not too 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.019
 disturb slowly and gently grope them 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.180
 approached and rode partially 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.310
 For days on the perfect moment 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 Scientists are there, it seems 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.719
 rather impatient to become quadrocopter 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.879
 increasingly for the observation of wild animals 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.920
 used but it pays off 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.560
 really and what do the animals think? 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.989
 of it it is groundless stress for the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.819
 animals or can actually be important 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 Findings gained through the wings 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.290
 if so how much will they suffer 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.720
 dedicated to wildlife among this question 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.349
 the experts of the university of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.069
 minnesota instinct paul your results 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.230
 They put in the trade magazine 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.790
 current biology 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.709
 the experts started four 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.900
 American black bear with gps 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.810
 senders and a heartbeat knife 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.299
 then the aircraft came to the train whole 18 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.849
 once the quadrocopter started and made 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.189
 in about 20 meters altitude on the way to 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.079
 the animals at his wild probanden 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.510
 arrived he managed there then 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.310
 about five minutes after five 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.530
 minutes the quadrocopter returned 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 together starting point back all 18 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.540
 Flights were accurately documented each 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.120
 the wild proband had been in 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.049
 of the character a measurably increased 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.030
 heart rate 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.189
 These results should be considered as 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.139
 Scientist in front of a quadrocopter 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.930
 use in any case through your head 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 let go is the use of stress 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.569
 out of round or is the reason important that 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.310
 means the research results are the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.650
 It can be gained as important 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.989
 that the stress for the animals is reasonable 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.370
 is 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.379
 a few weeks ago we reported to them 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.469
 the tip to the conclusion of the researchers 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.969
 an artificial rat photo bred 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.340
 now it seems a us scientist 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.730
 something almost unimaginable succeeded too 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.950
 his 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.380
 rené idea of the ohio state 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.470
 According to him, university has it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.410
 managed to create the brain that 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.620
 of a 35 day old embryo it resembles that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.320
 brain would also be a major part of 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.479
 brain regions of the cell types and the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.639
 genes involve an artificial one 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.169
 brain could soon be in the area 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.580
 of neurological medicine 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.740
 abstain from animal experiments 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.160
 that sounds very convincing and 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.720
 almost perfect but has the brain 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.580
 no blood vessels and as you might 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.340
 could notice in the last sentences 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.370
 Often the conjunctive came 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.479
 would have waited so could wait 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.860
 what is there waiting for us 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.900
 who of you has your own? 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.650
 garden and also built vegetables or fruits 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.229
 Sign in 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.599
 yes so thought of it before that he 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.580
 on self-built vegetables could die 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.440
 that sounds pretty unlikely 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.630
 But a gardener from Heidenheim is 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.659
 that's exactly what happened to him died 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.580
 self-grown zucchini of the 79 years 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.500
 old man was in heidenheim in one 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.210
 clinic brought first guess stomach 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.919
 intestinal complaints are actually the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.260
 But then man and that is really 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.729
 pulling bad at a kubica 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
 poisoning died 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.330
 one finds this perpetration 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.389
 for example in a zucchini melon 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.760
 pumpkin or in a cucumber in small 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.530
 quantities due to mutations or to cheap ones 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.510
 growth conditions that's exactly what you know 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.680
 yet this poison can not 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.479
 enrich 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.419
 the plants taste good, however 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.090
 super bitter maria roth is the head of the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.930
 chemical and 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.039
 veterinary examination office in stuttgart 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.900
 In short, according to her, people would do that 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.300
 Bitter vegetables immediately from the mouth 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.289
 But how could then the man 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 die from it 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.210
 this one not only has the schedule 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.350
 but eaten in a casserole so 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.230
 be mitigated somewhat 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.090
 in addition to the cv now also investigates 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.880
 Prosecutor Ellwangen the case 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.650
 quote it must be checked if anyone 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.380
 a reproach made at the death of the man 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.750
 can be or fate for it 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.580
 is responsible for such a spokesman 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.590
 Prosecutor Ellwangen 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.200
 in Germany is still a deadly 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.480
 Danger around not bitter zucchini 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.280
 but more aggressive mosquitoes to the 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.350
 dangerous mosquitoes you will experience in the 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.210
 video up here to rap and block 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.520
 comes to down here and tell us 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.980
 but in the comments if you yourself 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.630
 vegetable or fruit and whether he 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.120
 certain safety precautions 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.160
 meet before the fruit vegetables or 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.480
 is or how about mushrooms I was 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.790
 how do you go with self-harvested ones 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.470
 plants around so write it in the 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.350
 comments I am on your answers 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.350
 curious and stay tuned until then
