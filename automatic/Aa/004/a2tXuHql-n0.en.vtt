00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.100
 good to all here in 623 and today I 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.710
 I bring another video of rebutting 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.050
 theories this time will be about the interest 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.090
 from newton zombies and good to start 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.780
 not so zombies is a remake of the map 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.730
 multiplayer of new town of whites one 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.529
 adapted to the zombie story the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.869
 theories that circulate on this map is 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.509
 of the possible interest of which it deals in 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.050
 open the bunker in the yard 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:32.529
 Rear of the back of the house 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.529
 green I think it is if it is not the yellow 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.460
 well this these rumors so to speak 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.570
 they say that by taking a few steps we can 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.320
 open the bunker and inside there is something hidden 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.830
 some say graffiti written in Nazis 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 others on tv3 teleporter that you 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.750
 Take transit etc. Etcetera 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.850
 It is also said that the steps 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.070
 are described in the counter of the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 medium to the good map in this video 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.970
 I will prove that all that is wrong 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.550
 and that in my opinion there is no 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.500
 interest in the map making a small 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.300
 I want to say that yes there is 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.220
 esther ex the interests of the songs 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.780
 but not an interest where they 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.700
 we are used which 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.620
 we interact with him and they give us a 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.450
 reward at the end 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.090
 to prove all this we 're going to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
 move to nu town of black ops 1 where 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.510
 already at the beginning we can see that the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.150
 supposed steps described in the counter 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.710
 also appear here not only that the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.990
 first symbol which is said to be 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.520
 a vice and according to people it's about 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.560
 shoot the bike and throw it to the ground 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.440
 It is also here and we can also 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.690
 shoot and throw it to the ground there's also 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.870
 objects that we can move like these 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.090
 round paperweight and the trophy 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.680
 which appear in zombies and it was said 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 that they had to move to an area 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.980
 specific thing that we see that also 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.170
 they are here and it does not have to be like that 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.270
 we can also see the generators that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.400
 can be burst on the map and it 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 he said it was to make another step of 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.830
 lister in which we had to burst 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.840
 all plugs all generators 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 all electrical device to cause a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.010
 overload on the map or something like that very 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 rare 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.329
 Finally we can see the bookshelf with 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.879
 the rip off book in which people 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.670
 seeing him in a zombie he also thought that 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.230
 it was part of some stress and it's not like that 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.930
 bookshelves with these books are 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.019
 spread over many maps both 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.440
 multiplayer like zombies and I think the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.170
 first map was synonymous with world war yes 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.690
 I'm not mistaken 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.819
 in short both my does not have any 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 stress from my point of view is 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.530
 just a remake of the famous map 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.959
 multiplayer of black ops 1 that have 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.069
 adapted to the zombie story 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.050
 turning it into a transition map 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.400
 with the transition thing I mean that 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.920
 speak located between the end of the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.020
 zombie story of black ops 1 where yes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.360
 he did not remember the evil rite feng meets his 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 master plan and enter the mpd in world 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560
 going on to control the zombies and for 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.930
 last we throw the rockets to destroy 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.180
 the earth and the beginning of the history of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.580
 white zombie 2 where they show us 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.440
 what marton is a scientist from area 51 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 that has escaped through the bunkers 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 when all the zombies escaped in 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.180
 area 51 and that the bus was also something 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.239
 of area 51 that was circulating there in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.760
 that moment a thing for those who do not 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.380
 know is that the original version is 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.780
 We'll go to the bunker, listen to the 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.239
 MÃ¡rton voice inside you can see it on 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.720
 all in the ng channel 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.700
 zombie if I'm not wrong 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.060
 and this is another reason why 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.830
 I think you can not open the bunker 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.280
 we were not going to find the martona and 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.680
 It would be very strange 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.290
 the problem that our version does not 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.720
 you hear is a translation that does not 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.400
 they did and it can not surprise us much 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.930
 because already in totem kino with some 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.030
 radios also happened in the version 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.730
 original the radios were heard and in 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.620
 the translated version not so in 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 definitive the nut map with zombies is a 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.640
 simple remake of blacos 1 which they have 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.680
 adapted to the zombie store by converting it 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.150
 on a transitional map between the end of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.340
 the zombie story of whites 1 and the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.170
 start of targets 2 last for 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.489
 put in a small visual test of 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.890
 why the bunker will never be able to 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.310
 open and therefore there is no 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.710
 interest with that we will take advantage of a 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.110
 small glitch of the cinema mode which we 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.910
 allows you to leave the map and as you can see where 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.520
 there is the bunker there is nothing there is not a 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.230
 secret room or a room not only 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.030
 that in the rest of the map there is no 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.969
 absolutely nothing that could indicate that 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.889
 there is a possible hysteria 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.509
 so I can assure you that in this 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.360
 remake of the map can not open the 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.399
 bunker and if you see any comment from 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.909
 someone who says otherwise you have to 

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.909
 tell them always 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.950
 and this is all thanks for watching them but 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.290
 have helped to dispel doubts and also 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.840
 I want to ask for a little apology for the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.690
 video so short but it's very simple 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.570
 not as zombies as I said 20 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.050
 Sometimes it is a simple map without interest 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.840
 remake of black ops 1 and that's why it does not have 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.180
 interest in both targets 1 the bunker does not 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.760
 it could open not so zombies is not going to 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.130
 to open and in utah a 2025 is not going to 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.410
 to be able to open despite what the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.510
 people and you know if you see someone who 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:27.340
 says otherwise you have to tell him 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.910
 goodbye and until the next video 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.910
 and 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.700
 and 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.190
 it is offered to whom it dances 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.190
 and
