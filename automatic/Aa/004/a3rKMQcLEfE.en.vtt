the plants that are on that are working

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.259 
the plants that are on that are working
to<00:02:26.330> take<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.380> some<00:02:27.980> carbon<00:02:28.250> dioxide<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.880> give

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
to take in some carbon dioxide and give

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.360 
to take in some carbon dioxide and give
out<00:02:29.450> oxygen<00:02:30.380> or<00:02:30.500> vice<00:02:30.709> versa<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.100> other<00:02:31.220> words

out oxygen or vice versa in other words

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.420 
out oxygen or vice versa in other words
the<00:02:31.459> gases<00:02:31.760> oxygen<00:02:32.570> think<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.920> need<00:02:34.100> actually

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the gases oxygen think you need actually

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.949 
the gases oxygen think you need actually
because<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.820> won't<00:02:35.030> live<00:02:35.239> without<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
because you won't live without it so you

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.020 
because you won't live without it so you
were<00:02:36.080> saying<00:02:36.350> there<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.650> oxygen<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.549> this<00:02:37.730> very

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
were saying there is oxygen in this very

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.000 
were saying there is oxygen in this very
room<00:02:38.330> oh<00:02:38.510> if<00:02:39.140> there<00:02:39.350> weren't<00:02:39.500> we'd<00:02:39.769> be<00:02:39.890> having

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
room oh if there weren't we'd be having

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.370 
room oh if there weren't we'd be having
a<00:02:40.220> very<00:02:40.430> very<00:02:40.700> short<00:02:41.269> discussion<00:02:41.630> Ally<00:02:41.959> but

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
a very very short discussion Ally but

foods<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.410> modify<00:02:52.800> any<00:02:53.250> plan<00:02:53.610> pretty

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
foods can you modify any plan pretty

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.620 
foods can you modify any plan pretty
much<00:02:54.690> yeah<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:56.040> most<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.700> your<00:02:56.880> research<00:02:57.270> in

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
much yeah so is most of your research in

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.600 
much yeah so is most of your research in
developing<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.350> next<00:02:58.500> generation<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:59.250> Super

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
tomorrow's has been grown from seed if

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.450 
tomorrow's has been grown from seed if
you<00:03:13.170> look<00:03:13.350> at<00:03:13.470> what's<00:03:13.680> at<00:03:13.980> what<00:03:14.220> gets

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
you look at what's at what gets

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.740 
you look at what's at what gets
developed<00:03:14.940> out<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.090> science

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
developed out of science

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.630 
developed out of science
it<00:03:16.230> depends<00:03:16.800> other<00:03:17.100> things<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.370> said<00:03:17.610> you
