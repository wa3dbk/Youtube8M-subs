00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.269

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.810
 masses that is that these letters that is the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.480
 paper of interest speaking all russians 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.750
 the helmet by let's say not without before like 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:33.590
 what is the world in the normal and today not 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.100
 check that it complies with every invoice and 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:42.710
 I'm thinking about our pop is our 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:47.540
 heart and now it takes away feeling important 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.500
 it's all Madrid is beautiful country and those 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.010
 french 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 I 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.650
 my name is now I understand it because 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.670
 This is Castilian Spanish but 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.159
 we understand in the video we are talking 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.369
 Castilian but of course he knows with you 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.710
 language I understand stories 99 but only 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 125 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 If I speak Spanish English and German to 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.869
 person perfectly bunch me yo yo 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.869
 only 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.590
 good but if you speak so many languages 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.590
 because they do not speak baby languages 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 he does not understand how you understand in a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 lots of good stuff but we do not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.429
 they understand there are some who say by 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.429
 example when they want to drink water 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.709
 I do not understand I do not understand it because if 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.220
 I win and friends you because they believe that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.930
 babies do not speak 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.950
 why 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.680
 not small talk to us that they do not have 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:28.859
 teeth because they are very minor part 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.629
 they do not have teeth because they are seeing and they say 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.629
 mom does 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:44.209
 because I'm point because he has a tooth 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.209
 which are books that are smaller 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.180
 because you can not stay as he talks about 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 these guys these guys are no longer 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.860
 guys and well just not monkeys either 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.750
 they are babies can already talk really is 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.760
 incredible but where they learned what 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.160
 spoken and good what happens that like you 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.569
 and I the boys grow up and go 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.080
 learning to speak and then go to 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.790
 school are perfected so if we see 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 what was your first word of first 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.870
 stick in what language in Spanish is for 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.489
 which one goes in Spanish I remember 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.400
 that my mom told me that the first the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.400
 first word I said was dad me 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:30.890
 neither because we look at the world 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:39.640
 and I have to talk about what is not 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.860
 they speak like us because the language 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.990
 is learning with the days with the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.850
 months and with the years and because we in a 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.220
 course and you can not go to school 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.410
 to study babies learn to talk 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.300
 when your parents brothers uncles cousins 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.570
 they talk to them and while they are learning 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.700
 the words speak with the body not 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.940
 I understand he says what happens to them doing 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.190
 gestures make sounds and are angry or 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.570
 they cry if something hurts them or they are hungry 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.400
 he wears Munich and the baby is born in 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.350
 argentina learns Spanish and if born in 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.210
 Brazil learns Portuguese babies 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.950
 they learn the language of the people who 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.260
 they are with them if they are born in china 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.490
 they will learn chinese without doing in england 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.859
 they learn English 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.570
 interesting not at the end in argentina not 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.200
 they talk just like in Spain you can 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.390
 to know 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.210
 why do not you give me an example if 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.250
 example in a Spain I say lad 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.010
 let's talk as it says in 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.440
 Argentinian and an Argentine would say guys 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.360
 let's chat for a while 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.400
 for example if a child for example has 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.009
 a mother who is england a father who 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.020
 French and is raised in Argentina as 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.000
 speak the good boy is going to talk all 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.349
 the languages all because the boy is going to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.210
 speak the languages ​​that parents 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.099
 they teach and they decide to communicate and 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.770
 improve because he also knows more languages ​​and 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.389
 they learn them easier as I say yes 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.849
 you do not want to send any question or 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.800
 Do you have any doubt about something or someone or 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.210
 he's just thirsty for knowing more 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.409
 and more and more 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.389
