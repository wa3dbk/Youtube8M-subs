00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
through but fish works really well like

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.580 
through but fish works really well like
that<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:06.970> baking<00:01:07.659> I'm<00:01:08.110> gonna<00:01:08.260> be<00:01:08.380> using

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
that and then baking I'm gonna be using

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.969 
that and then baking I'm gonna be using
some<00:01:08.710> coals<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:10.240> couple<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.600> Pam's

some coals and a couple of Pam's
aluminum<00:01:11.979> pot<00:01:12.190> soot<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.970> little<00:01:13.180> bit<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.390> baking

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
aluminum pot soot a little bit of baking

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.710 
aluminum pot soot a little bit of baking
baking<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.220> pretty<00:01:15.430> easy<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.820> do<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.240> just

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
baking is pretty easy to do I just

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.540 
baking is pretty easy to do I just
remember<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.200> put<00:01:17.470> more<00:01:17.650> coals<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.100> top<00:01:18.130> and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
remember you put more coals on top and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
remember you put more coals on top and
you<00:01:18.610> do<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.820> bottom<00:01:18.970> you'll<00:01:19.270> be<00:01:19.390> all<00:01:19.540> right

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
you do the bottom you'll be all right

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.420 
you do the bottom you'll be all right
dutch<00:01:19.960> ovens<00:01:20.320> great<00:01:20.560> way<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.040> too<00:01:21.250> and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
dutch ovens great way to do it too and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.789 
dutch ovens great way to do it too and
then<00:01:22.210> boiling<00:01:22.780> I'm<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.080> bit<00:01:23.229> demonstrating

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
then boiling I'm a bit demonstrating

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.649 
then boiling I'm a bit demonstrating
some<00:01:23.950> boiling<00:01:24.370> I<00:01:24.580> think<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.270> right<00:01:25.420> there<00:01:25.450> is

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
some boiling I think that right there is

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.469 
some boiling I think that right there is
no.2<00:01:25.990> stove<00:01:26.520> great<00:01:27.520> little<00:01:27.729> stove<00:01:27.970> really

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
no.2 stove great little stove really

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.860 
no.2 stove great little stove really
kicks<00:01:28.720> out<00:01:28.900> some<00:01:29.110> heat<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.909> Zee<00:01:30.909> per<00:01:31.060> pot<00:01:31.270> to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
kicks out some heat and Zee per pot to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.510 
kicks out some heat and Zee per pot to
do<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:33.010> what<00:01:33.159> we're<00:01:33.280> gonna<00:01:33.369> be

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
do that so that's what we're gonna be

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.910 
do that so that's what we're gonna be
doing<00:01:33.549> we're<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.240> doing<00:01:34.450> frying<00:01:34.920> planking

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
doing we're be doing frying planking

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.460 
doing we're be doing frying planking
which<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.159> actually<00:01:36.460> roasting<00:01:37.000> baking<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
which is actually roasting baking and

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.830 
which is actually roasting baking and
boiling<00:01:39.430> boiling<00:01:39.850> being<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.360> healthiest

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
boiling boiling being the healthiest

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660 
boiling boiling being the healthiest
like<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.470> said<00:01:41.650> we<00:01:41.740> used<00:01:41.979> Bannock<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.549> all

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
like I said we used Bannock for all

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.010 
like I said we used Bannock for all
these<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.119> may<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.450> you're<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.690> boil
