00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
well I think it would be really arrogant

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800 
well I think it would be really arrogant
to<00:01:45.010> just<00:01:45.220> throw<00:01:45.430> out<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.550> guess<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.180> say<00:01:46.360> yes<00:01:46.570> I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
to just throw out a guess and say yes I

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.230 
to just throw out a guess and say yes I
would<00:01:46.869> survive<00:01:47.290> but<00:01:48.130> at<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> same<00:01:48.460> time<00:01:48.790> I

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
would survive but at the same time I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.770 
would survive but at the same time I
don't<00:01:49.510> think<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.770> like<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.130> underestimate
