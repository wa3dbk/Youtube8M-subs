00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.130
 mates you want to know how to look 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 reasonable so that nobody can 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 get that if the opposing armor so 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 correct on a demolition no problem 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'll show you everything in here today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 my follow the tank ademi the first one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 and maybe the most important thing we know 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 should wallis armor ever and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 which means that this is relatively easy too 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 declare armor decides about it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 if you are hit by one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.460
 projectile or generic 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.349
 Vehicle frame should be whether you harm 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 and if you get hurt too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.730
 sometimes how much damage you receive 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 the values ​​for your armor you can see 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 top right in the garage and it is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.660
 once again divided into front 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.670
 armor sides armor and tail 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.250
 Armor each of the tub and the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 tower, however, you should 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.670
 quite urgently notice the values ​​here 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 are indicated are only 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 average values and calculate 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.719
 no angle space on the ear or 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 other eventualities one but it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.050
 is really just about the values ​​and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 thickness of the armor 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.650
 if you want to know where or who 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 enemy armor strongest 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 armored are actually a few 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 Principles that always apply 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 Most heavily armored on the tower again 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.909
 stronger around the cannon 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.369
 then comes the front tub then the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.560
 side tub and then the stern and on 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.310
 armored least one is usually 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 on top 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 So if you miss a shot from above 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 most of the time it happens 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.659
 worst of all so now we have a lot 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.210
 but what does that im saying? 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.280
 play relatively easy every time 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 your bullet on the armor of one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.530
 opponent meets tests the server was the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.630
 the armor value is higher 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.540
 on the spot or not if you have it 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.830
 was not 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.990
 if she was 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.730
 went fully through their armor, the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.490
 exception to the rule as with the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.479
 last consequence we have learned and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.130
 hessen reactions 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.530
 since it is a bit different is 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.630
 Looked the ball hits and ever 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.920
 after how thick the armor is doing 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.810
 I either harm full or 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.160
 In a few percent I'll show you that 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.459
 that was twelve harms me now 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.820
 Especially sometimes when the tanks 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.950
 nadal is one or the other too thick 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.570
 is now perhaps he is thinking 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.670
 all well and good but I have a 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.440
 as often as I shoot at the opponent and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.060
 the ball bounces off here or the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.580
 I can not do it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 enough penetration well and there I can 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.170
 just say he has the problem right 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.790
 the story is and me that it works 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.320
 not just to pay the pure ones 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.850
 wargaming you in the garage for 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.560
 disposal but there are still 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.570
 so what's his angle of inclination 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 there is something like upstream 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.070
 armor because there are weak spots in 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.020
 the armor there is still coat the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.000
 So there is a lot around the cannon 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.910
 a lot you can learn with it 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.670
 knows because I have to meet the opponent or 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 aha this place on my tank must 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.500
 facing enemy fire 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.080
 hide 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.150
 because many newcomers in the game of kv 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.040
 once as the first real fortress 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.560
 is opposite and they think but 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.989
 the hit I have this 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.310
 example, now out the kv 1 sought 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.860
 actually has one on the front 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.000
 armor which is from the values herd 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.310
 do you say he has to be there? 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.350
 actually get through but the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.660
 armor is just not just but 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.040
 which it flattened in some places and 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.350
 For that we had to put others on 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.650
 weak spots shows you when 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.310
 she shoots no chance shoots 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 her on that did not go through but there 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.480
 here is this thing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.969
 because as in this sequence simply not the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.079
 have time to take care of every tank and its 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.430
 weak spots or special features 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.019
 I'll give you a few 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.609
 Principles with at hand those you 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.629
 should help in the right fight 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.780
 to meet 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.000
 usually number one if you have something 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 something special about the armor is striking 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.780
 in a slot or a dome or otherwise 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.340
 what then is usually one 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.709
 weak point and then you get there 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.719
 by rule number two the stronger the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.650
 inclination of an armor the harder 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.409
 to penetrate 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.450
 So do not shoot if you see that 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.959
 is that scary weird 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.609
 does not bring anything 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.069
 usually number three if you can 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.169
 Avoid it on the tower of the opponent 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.959
 shoot because most of the time 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.489
 armored of all points 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.160
 Rule number four are chains and others 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.500
 upstream armor suck the quasi 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.780
 the damage and the impact 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.340
 firearm in and prevents 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.080
 that you hit the real tank 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.690
 but the whole penetration stops 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.349
 caught in the chains big exception 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.270
 and easy to remember the first and 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.520
 the last chain rat allows you 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.300
 in almost all tanks both the chains 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.400
 to destroy as well as harm 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.919
 usually number five if the angle with 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.960
 that your bullet hits is too big 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.120
 there will eventually be the automatic 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.740
 rebound no matter how big or by 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.960
 is worth it on your weapon if 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.690
 the angle becomes too sharp or too blatant 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.639
 then there is a rebound no matter 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.710
 yes and now there were a few 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.120
 Principles of a hand have what is 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.070
 actually your goal 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.599
 if you have to decide how 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.190
 I can stand myself down now 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.320
 so that the opponent is not possible 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.090
 I get through my armor 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.830
 you have a small standard error 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.479
 almost every beginner at his 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.849
 first try world of tanks power 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.500
 when he tries to drive around the corners 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.389
 He could not do that to me then 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.219
 Do not just go straight around the corner 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.020
 and wants like with a normal car the 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.689
 turn and then what often 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.939
 the following happened 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.309
 Immediately the first shot is fired 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.409
 which harms you and eventually 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.939
 if you are unlucky the first shot will 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.129
 even if you had destroyed her 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.629
 be unable to move is ready 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.069
 behind the corner you do not even 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.749
 can shoot back and since one 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.549
 easy sacrifice for your opponent 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.649
 That's why I show you the now 

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:51.569
 right way how you like them 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:53.549
 You can drive around corners as one 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.499
 small tip for everyone easy 

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:57.209
 can persist 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.979
 so if you know hey behind the corner 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:00.809
 if an opponent stands then I do this 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.549
 mistake and drive around the bend like that 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.860
 last book but has been around a 

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:07.379
 trick those seitz rating of 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.599
 combines that angling the 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.589
 armor up to a certain maximum 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:15.509
 and that the chains are worth the penetration 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:18.089
 absorb the enemy water 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.959
 that together combines the rating in 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.589
 one over and is your optimal 

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.029
 defense strategy if you vista 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.469
 is one around the corner and you want 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.179
 fight against and if possible no 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.099
 get hurt and I'll show you now 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:31.860
 again kv 1 is right and makes 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.059
 how everything goes wrong as well as the kvn it 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.079
 it's already around the corner now 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.429
 much better 

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:37.469
 you do not see the first one immediately 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.360
 chain wheel and even if you are on it 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.279
 he can shoot back immediately 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.499
 because he is virtually with the toom around the corner 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.329
 now comes the perfect way and 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:47.129
 as used in the site scripting 

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.050
 to make every enemy burn up 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.899
 he tries to harm you 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.029
 then comes namely so around the corner 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.949
 and you shoot at him and you can 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.689
 Do not do him any harm 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.369
 and the ride has been backwards 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.050
 back behind the corner, until you see her 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.819
 to shoot at the opponent and everything 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.619
 what the enemy sees of you is the 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.509
 side in a very unfavorable angle 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:09.569
 plus the chains and that's what you call 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.519
 site scripting gentleman and if you 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.499
 Heeded these few simple rules 

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:15.899
 and the scalping maneuver was not something 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:17.519
 learning to use is so difficult 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:20.329
 then you will see that too easily 

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:22.739
 armored vehicles such as eg the term to 

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:24.749
 must be scary species 

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:25.469
 So hide your weak spots 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:27.389
 the opponent
