00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 who opposes the axé but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.240
 czapnik mertian than mike with cerium 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.480
 god people it's fatma 80 hd I hope 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.010
 that you're fine my coach we get 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.200
 found for episode 5 to rebate 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.910
 cup with the super liga team that I have 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.650
 created last time in my squat 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.290
 builder it's a squat builder that's 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.220
 released a couple of weeks ago and 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.800
 about half 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.800
 so or by jean who says nice cooper 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.869
 money shot ten money teams then 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.430
 I apologize for what they are going 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.440
 find that I made a lot of her a 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.730
 pass triangle passes and all that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.989
 I have no team I have not what they 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.059
 their in this team so I'm doing with 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 the means of the edge that is to say I play 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.960
 efficiency thoroughly especially you actually 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.909
 I co ag it is necessary to know is that I have 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.100
 not bad galley for this competition in 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.519
 did I have this episode is done since 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.769
 long time 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.420
 so I take this opportunity there you see 1-0 already 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.489
 this episode is done for a long time 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.440
 it's just that I actually lost all 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.040
 my gameplay so I had I did not have 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.540
 won the cup 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.250
 I did I lost a lot of matches 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.449
 and in fact I can not find the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.100
 gameplay I do not know where they are 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.530
 past so I actually had to turn my 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 matches yesterday what makes you have 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.090
 life today and I had to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.770
 actually rush and it's that they have 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.930
 it plays almost always with the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.310
 same way in this competition so 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.780
 a goal everywhere you 've seen 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 the equalization there you see the very 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.439
 nice shot well exit by the keeper 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.520
 so it's me too I saw in the 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.119
 comments people who complain about 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.829
 to roll up because I'm rolling 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.880
 I do not know why when I'm 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.170
 in front of the goalkeeper lighthouse play have rolled 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.219
 it's somewhere a little logical 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.049
 that's how football is 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.729
 and when you're in front of the guardian you're going 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.369
 not put me to my robot in big ball 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.509
 on the on the guardian you want to put a 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.909
 flat foot so there you had 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.770
 super small triangle small stitched 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.820
 to lob the goalkeeper everywhere 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.259
 but otherwise I think that in 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.249
 the set now I calmed down 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.630
 at the level of the foot dishes now 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.620
 it's the ol a trio that will have to erase 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.390
 so the flat of the foot obviously 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.780
 I'm not going to hit in force while 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.070
 I have the goal open 3 goals to 2 there we at the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.070
 55th so in the second half 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.660
 little festival of which he passes that passes 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.670
 far off the problem of this 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.200
 team is actually she is that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.830
 crunches a lot, but 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.479
 very much 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.190
 so there you see the beautiful little 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.780
 action unfortunately the head goes on to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.130
 side and there you have the keystroke on the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.480
 guardian and that's where it's 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.950
 finish on a match on a score of 3 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.540
 goals to 2 so the arm a match a 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.740
 win 3 goals to 2 at the end of a match 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.100
 where I had opportunities but they 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 had 54% possession for him that's 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.470
 an opponent who was not bad 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.050
 turn the balloon that were building 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.430
 a lot I had a hard time against him so 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.620
 there I meet a first line then 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.910
 the 1st league 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.820
 this year the first silver leagues 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.900
 it's just ignoble played in the sense 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.130
 where the guy there bellamy idea you hit 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.530
 ya goal with the you strike is beautiful 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.870
 friend then lives already first goal gag 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.310
 because my guardian misses his 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 relaunch it falls down peak in the feet 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.880
 of a newspaper there is more gaza a goal to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.190
 zero 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.290
 schwarz that shifts to ty guen scene 1 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.640
 goal 1 1 goal everywhere so I do not act 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.110
 hesitated to do ps1 I will not 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.330
 lie to you guys this is the match 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.920
 trap is there then the guen a triangle 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.830
 for anti pass the recovery completely 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.080
 messed up right next 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.060
 finally his choice if he has 46 passes 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.760
 the outside the guardian azores but that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.770
 tap on the bar right behind there a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.970
 depth for ibn who will shift sea 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.920
 games n 2 goals to 1 so I end up at 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.190
 lead to the score fairly quickly in the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.500
 match 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.170
 the pole the pole on this beautiful 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.690
 little strikes the feedback that will leave 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.120
 so feedback that is for me the best 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.160
 player of this team there you see the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.269
 beautiful exit of the beautiful parade of the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.530
 backup guardian is really very 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.080
 fort the manchester city guard is 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.780
 so there the double contact the lava strikes 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.040
 in the skylight 3 goals to 1 this guard is 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.330
 really very good it's the keeper of 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.090
 manchester city and the disavowal keeper 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.450
 Romanian guardian I believe and I was already 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.910
 fallen against him 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.220
 the ten episodes website is supposed to go out 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.450
 before but that will not come out 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.650
 unfortunately not say I do not find 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.599
 the more my gameplay I do not know where it's 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.980
 so the 3 2 he will do so I did 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.349
 a match where I lost I think I 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.209
 lost 2 1 he made me a stop number 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.620
 I think I was almost 30 strikes 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.910
 he stopped me everything I could do more 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.170
 limit I could have done a compilation 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.209
 on this guard I could have done a 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.420
 plain review just about what he put me 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.200
 so in the end a win 3 goals to 2 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.150
 I had opportunities I had 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.100
 possession of styrene with 54% 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.660
 possession of the ball at the end of a match 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.919
 that's the end of a match anyway 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.620
 complicated because it's enough 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.610
 difficult to defend on bpm is 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.780
 so here I am going to fall against a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.610
 opponent including jacques lemonnier 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.220
 dortmund so a very very nice team 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.870
 league 1 frankly I was scared 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.460
 I was scared and it's going pretty well 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.760
 spend my first opportunity the 20th 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.139
 minute 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.380
 it's going to be the match was still 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.840
 closed enough there he raises the recovery badly 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.130
 disgusting of my player at end who 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.010
 intercepts a balloon that give it to the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.139
 conceal chosen the small hook the dish 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.479
 from foot 1 goal to 0 after 34 minutes of 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.220
 that mature game where there is no 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.010
 a lot of opportunities in it so 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.530
 secular boon silva gave it to feedback 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.000
 feedback which shifts the pole choise 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.870
 so a lot of posts a lot of 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.460
 poles and that's how it's a 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.110
 myth this match there was no more than 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.910
 big opportunities that so you see them 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.289
 statistics 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 again I have more opportunities 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.990
 that he but frankly the opportunities 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.639
 I have not found an interesting state 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.320
 it was a lot of strikes countered this 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.360
 kind of sentence you're in front of the defense 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.380
 you hit it, a player is there 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.190
 I tend against a very very beautiful 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.229
 brazilian team 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.430
 I saw some videos and I saw playing 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.130
 ring I thought I'll do that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.510
 skill not at all so he spent his 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.950
 time running straight to his line 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.720
 on wallison 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.010
 it was really very interesting I do not 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.310
 did not know that allison was good of the 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.170
 head 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.820
 in the end he's not good back he has 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.260
 noticed so there you see input 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.620
 already two very beautiful parades of his 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.330
 guardian 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.130
 I'm going to run schwarz in the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.570
 very beautiful depth strikes another one 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.180
 time well gone out by his very caretaker 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.120
 good guard opposite you look at money 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.850
 So there the center to fall the recovery 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.620
 instantaneous direct 1 goal to 0 so 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.210
 it was not against the course of the game I 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.220
 deserved anyway so here I also run 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.810
 because the stitched ball act that 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.170
 unfortunately low is out by his 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.610
 guardian is so there begins the festival 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.820
 drobo mpm so there you see bad 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.970
 interception wallison who goes to the goal a 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.730
 goal everywhere so a goal enough a media 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.830
 still the last minutes of the match 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.590
 I'm going to have the ball just two 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.210
 hours I completely messed me up so 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.530
 I wanted to put it because you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.830
 have seen the unspoken fault does not have 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.450
 hissed halftime antipas by what we 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.440
 there goes the little festival the big 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.760
 hits well exit by his keeper 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.740
 higuain who will give it to the art scene 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.140
 there the feedback that shifts chooseelat 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.720
 acrobatic recovery so there m1 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.250
 triangle or allison ti'pass wallison 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.930
 that he is not moving so I had to 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.520
 defender strong enough but he 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.840
 had to move so your friends from the little lake 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.840
 it went off the hook and oddly and 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.370
 so here the most shit goal here 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.040
 look at it lags impossible to 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.750
 defend under these conditions and well he 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.280
 will just run to the point with his 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.580
 moving vise 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.690
 big point bn 90 of force and so bah 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.460
 it is unfortunately here that will 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.900
 end this episode on a defeat 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.550
 in the final of the silver cup revenge 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.650
 of the team I will do another team 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.180
