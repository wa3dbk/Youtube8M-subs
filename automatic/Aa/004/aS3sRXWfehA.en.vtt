00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.650
 this is a park 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.870
 hello how are you were not here in 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.540
 a new mini game of these same ones that 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.830
 is invented share rare and today I'm 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.830
 here with ala kraft 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.450
 well I explain a little bit what is 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.220
 this minigame this mini game is called 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.680
 pk 2 and flight and the game is that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.370
 we will be up, we will be 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.710
 top right those pillars so high and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 what we have to do is simply 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 take and depending on the block that is 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.250
 we have to use a tool u 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.840
 another right now because we have three that 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.420
 they are the only ones that there is the ax of 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 iron in the iron blade and the peak of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.210
 iron then the first to burn 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 because down here where is this from 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.550
 here is a let's say a hole with lava 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 then the first one who is the one who 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 lava will signal that it has been the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.970
 first to get off said this to you're 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.990
