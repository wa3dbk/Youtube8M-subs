00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.040
 we have come to the fourth iteration for 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.240
 the skylanders the second as far as 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.070
 concerns the next gen 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.510
 and direct competition with disney 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.640
 finished does not seem to have the slightest 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.140
 scratched the excessive power of the brand either 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.970
 nor the attractiveness that this has 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.290
 we also exercise towards the boys 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.670
 on the other hand when we receive from 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.739
 activision copies for proof of 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.879
 product we become anxious crickets of 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.190
 unpack everything the fastest 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.809
 You can be safe every time you come back 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.270
 15 years back and continue 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.620
 have fun like crazy the success of the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.540
 series comes from that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.070
 simplicity and that involvement that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.229
 only good quality games succeed 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.729
 to offer those titles thanks to which it is 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.190
 You can have fun regardless 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.350
 by age if the basis of the gameplay then 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.180
 they are now ultra-tested for toys for bob 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.130
 the main problem is becoming 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.810
 find something that can continue to 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.970
 astonish to keep players glued 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.619
 therefore not only new figurines but also 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.690
 mechanical able to always maintain 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.210
 fresh production back again 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.770
 in the sky lances with lord chaos we see it 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.300
 enemy of the skylanders he has well 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.160
 thought to blow up the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.690
 prison breaks out where they were 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.880
 locked up some of the most criminals 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.740
 dangerous of the kingdom with the help of a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.509
 brand new portal and some specials 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.399
 new traps we will embark with 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.289
 old unpublished characters to bring back 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.149
 peace in the sky lances history 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.860
 simple as always is suitable for the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.390
 relevant public and introduction 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.280
 of a lot of new enemies 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.380
 manages to vary the base sufficiently 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.819
 starting the philosophy behind the game 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.259
 this time he wants the bad guys 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.450
 caught with our traps 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.130
 end up directly in the real world e 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.179
 this step really works at 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.500
 great 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.030
 fighting against your enemies e 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.130
 coming to one of the many bosses 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 present in the game you will have to face a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.970
 a medium complex combat and one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.590
 once won you will just have to insert in the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.330
 portal a crystal of the element 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.770
 corresponding to the boss killed for 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.349
 trap it permanently 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.240
 as soon as it is caught this will be fired 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.680
 in the crystal trap and his 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.540
 will arrive directly from 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.520
 gaming platform in the room 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.050
 giving the whole a great sense of 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 involvement from the trap 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.130
 so come jokes and noises with 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.510
 each boss equipped with a unique set of 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.000
 lines of dialogue easily 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 recognizable the design of the enemies is not 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.599
 particularly sought after are not lacking 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.430
 in fact the clones with only partial 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.290
 changes but there are some though 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.050
 Enemies so special as to be 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.060
 incredibly 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.400
 and charismatic we are obviously talking about 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.860
 of broccoli gae for example ours 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 favorite or chef's for a jack 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.790
 huge evil pepper capable of 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.380
 launch devastating area attacks 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.570
 the introduction of these enemies is not 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.010
 only as a side dish but rather takes on a 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.260
 fundamental role within the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.910
 gameplay since these bosses once 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.280
 captured can be freely 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.390
 used during games 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.520
 obviously there are restrictions 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.230
 important but these do nothing but 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.750
 give more depth to the system of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.380
 game that after the fourth appearance 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.960
 began to suffer from a certain 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.280
 flatness with the trap in the portal is 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.080
 the simple trigger pressure 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 we can now call back to the field of 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.380
 I play our prisoner e 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.270
 use it in everything and for everything like 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.100
 any of the other skylanders 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.080
 primary and secondary attacks are at 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
 basic combat system and hack style 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.890
 and classic slash permanents between teams 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 to avoid turning bosses into 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.220
 identical characters like mechanics and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.320
 puppets intervene two features 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.090
 interesting the first is a bar 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.770
 time that will limit its use 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 only for a certain period of time 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.730
 while the second corresponds to 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.410
 impossibility of raising levels 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.600
 boss as usually happens with the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.489
 skylanders instead having to exploit a 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.470
 quest-based upgrade system 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.120
 established that they will give new ones 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.220
 attacks and also a unique aspect to the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.959
 our little creatures every single trap 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.730
 can contain one and only enemy e 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.140
 in the game center we will have the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.790
 possibility to change the monster 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.980
 trapped through a simple menu 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.690
 looking for combinations that succeed in 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.530
 make up for the lack of skylanders 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.090
 main 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.890
 in fact, this year there are new ones 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.780
 mechanical linked to the good ones and indeed 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.580
 compared to the past too many allows 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.560
 to be completed one hundred percent 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.359
 using only the characters of 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.030
 this last series without having to do 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.070
 resort to giants swap force of the kind 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.720
 backwards compatibility is however guaranteed 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.090
 and all the old skylanders can 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.050
 be used with this version 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.880
 thus bringing the available characters 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.460
 to have an incredible variety of 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.410
 moves every time toys for bob succeeds in 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.030
 develop ever-changing heroes and ad 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.340
 except for some revival of the 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.800
 best known characters like hogwarts towing 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.110
 and shrum boom design characterization 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.180
 and they are really excellent 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.610
 with this season 16 colossal with with 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.480
 masters equipped with special drills 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.400
 and in the pantry 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.080
 to open the different portals and mental 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.520
 present in the main campaign 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.590
 the old doors that hide treasures 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.450
 in fact hats will not be able to 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.950
 more to be opened by normal skylanders 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.690
 forcing them to buy at least one 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.520
 trip master by item if you want 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.470
 complete all the game and collect 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.990
 all collectibles are actually missing 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.820
 9 thick related to gameplay and perhaps in 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.070
 this sense had offered decidedly 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.600
 more about the 15 stages of the campaign 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.250
 playable as always in coop with the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.200
 typical drop in drop out system e 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.490
 from the classical duration of eight hours are 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.630
 flanked by a whole series of 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.730
 rather alternative ways 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.200
 interesting the chaos actor vi 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.820
 will allow you to face a likeable one 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.980
 challenging tower defense based 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.180
 skylanders with wool there is not only of 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.890
 build tower to slow down 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.540
 the advance of enemies but also of 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.100
 take the field firsthand for 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.760
 fight to cure your bulwarks 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.170
 defensive 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.180
 there is not even a kind of 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.040
 horde mode and a minigame on the cards 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.270
 from extremely simple mechanics 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.320
 but able to capture attention 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.390
 of the youngest 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.550
 finally the technical sector is good with 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.050
 bright colors excellent characters and a 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.640
 great sound to act as a boundary 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.530
 to production of sure value 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.330
 to report unfortunately some slight 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.870
 drop of framerate on the xbox version 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.340
 one 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.110
 nothing however that affects the experience 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.790
 overall play 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.620
 skylanders truck team is the natural one 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.210
 evolution of the brand this fourth 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.040
 chapter arrives on our consoles 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.570
 taking new enemies with you 9 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.670
 mechanics and new skyliners from 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.260
 collecting without going to 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.580
 touch a run-in formula that by now 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.470
 it works more than just fine 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.640
 if you love the series get ready to open 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.640
 the wallet again
