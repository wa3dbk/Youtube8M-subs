00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
don't think it's long enough to hold

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.880 
don't think it's long enough to hold
bantu<00:01:02.039> knots<00:01:02.219> alone<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.170> the

bantu knots alone so I like to have the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to use any products I like to do

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.800 
going to use any products I like to do
two<00:01:08.670> strand<00:01:08.760> twists<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
two strand twists just because it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
two strand twists just because it
defines<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.740> better<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
defines it a little bit better and has a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.810 
defines it a little bit better and has a
better<00:01:11.580> hold<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.799> whenever<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.640> my

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
better hold and so whenever I do this my

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.670 
better hold and so whenever I do this my
hair<00:01:15.090> ends<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.360> turning<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.990> soft<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hair ends up turning really soft and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
hair ends up turning really soft and
just<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.100> flowy<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> airy<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
just very flowy and airy and I like that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
just very flowy and airy and I like that
when<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> comes<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> big<00:01:20.280> hair<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
when it comes to like big hair and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.820 
when it comes to like big hair and
things<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:22.290> isn't<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
things like that this isn't like a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
things like that this isn't like a
serious<00:01:23.460> style<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.090> wear<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.259> I

serious style to wear like you know I
care<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:27.930> defined<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
care for it to be very defined and I you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.390 
care for it to be very defined and I you
know<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.540> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
know I kind of want it to be like you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
know I kind of want it to be like you
know<00:01:32.430> wild<00:01:33.000> hair<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> don't<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> be

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
know wild hair so I don't want it to be

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.100 
know wild hair so I don't want it to be
too<00:01:35.159> defined<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:36.060> too<00:01:36.360> structured<00:01:36.720> or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
too defined or too structured or

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.899 
too defined or too structured or
anything<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
anything like that so with this it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.819 
anything like that so with this it's
much<00:01:39.119> easier<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.590> put

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
much easier for me to just not put

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.980 
much easier for me to just not put
product<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:41.909> redo<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
product on it and then just redo the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.249 
product on it and then just redo the
bantu<00:01:43.409> knots<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.100> next<00:01:44.460> day<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:45.030> days<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> come

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
bantu knots the next day or days to come

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
bantu knots the next day or days to come
and<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> twist<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
and so I'm just going to twist and you
guys<00:01:48.930> should<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> how<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> bantu<00:01:50.040> knot

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
guys should know how to do a bantu knot

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
guys should know how to do a bantu knot
but<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> guys<00:01:50.820> don't<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
but if you guys don't know how all you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.050 
but if you guys don't know how all you
have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> twist<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
have to do is just kind of twist the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
have to do is just kind of twist the
hair<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> root<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> pretty<00:01:55.619> tight

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
hair to where the root is pretty tight

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.359 
hair to where the root is pretty tight
or<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:56.549> close<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:59.040> being

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
or pretty close to you know not being

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
or pretty close to you know not being
loose<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.750> start<00:02:00.960> wrapping<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
loose and then just start wrapping and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.480 
loose and then just start wrapping and
my<00:02:02.399> trick<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> hump<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
my trick is I kind of put like a hump in

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.170 
my trick is I kind of put like a hump in
the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.970 
the
and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.540> wrap<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.080> around<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.770> it's

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
and then I wrap it around that and it's

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.810 
and then I wrap it around that and it's
much<00:02:08.130> easier<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.899> aspect<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.640> like

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
much easier in that aspect and so I like

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.730 
much easier in that aspect and so I like
to<00:02:11.970> spray<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.630> heat<00:02:12.840> protectant<00:02:13.380> just<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to spray the heat protectant just to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.500 
to spray the heat protectant just to
hold<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.270> show<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.850 
hold it and I'm not going to show you
guys<00:02:15.630> what<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> rest<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.770> the

of<00:02:25.560> other<00:02:25.890> things<00:02:26.010> i<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:27.209> decided<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.930> take

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
of other things i just decided to take

of other things i just decided to take
them<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:29.280> i<00:02:29.790> thought<00:02:30.209> they<00:02:30.570> were

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
them out because i thought they were

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.920 
them out because i thought they were
done<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.310> taking<00:02:33.209> them<00:02:33.330> out<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.690> just

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
done and so taking them out I just

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.100 
done and so taking them out I just
loosely<00:02:34.380> unravel<00:02:35.190> uncoil<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.750> let<00:02:36.959> them

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
loosely unravel uncoil and just let them

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.229 
loosely unravel uncoil and just let them
loose<00:02:37.380> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> stretch<00:02:38.220> them<00:02:38.459> down<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.060> where

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
loose kind of stretch them down to where

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.050 
loose kind of stretch them down to where
they<00:02:39.570> could<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.140> bounce<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:41.060> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
they could you know bounce back up in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.050 
they could you know bounce back up in
you<00:02:42.959> know<00:02:42.989> an<00:02:43.230> easy<00:02:43.410> way<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you know an easy way and so I like to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
you know an easy way and so I like to
shake<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.320> sure<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.709> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
shake it out just to make sure that you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.130 
shake it out just to make sure that you
know<00:02:47.160> they're<00:02:47.370> all<00:02:47.489> loose<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.090> all<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.840> bantu

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
know they're all loose in all the bantu

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.960 
know they're all loose in all the bantu
knots<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.500> taken<00:02:49.830> out<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> won't<00:02:50.459> feel<00:02:50.580> any

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
knots are taken out so I won't feel any

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.640 
knots are taken out so I won't feel any
you<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.300> humps<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.840> things<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you know humps and things like that and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.199 
you know humps and things like that and
so<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:53.190> I'm<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.850> start<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
so now I'm just going to start the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.470 
so now I'm just going to start the
process<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:55.040> separating<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.430> two<00:02:57.209> strand

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
process of separating the two strand

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.870 
process of separating the two strand
twists<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.980> separate<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
twists and all I do is just separate the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.840 
twists and all I do is just separate the
two<00:03:00.150> strands<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.100> after<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.220> I'll<00:03:02.400> fluff<00:03:02.700> it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
two strands and after that I'll fluff it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430 
two strands and after that I'll fluff it
out<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> bit<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> beginning<00:03:03.780> i'll<00:03:04.230> just

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
out a bit but in the beginning i'll just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.979 
out a bit but in the beginning i'll just
take<00:03:04.590> apart<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> two<00:03:05.700> strands<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.390> then

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
take apart the two strands and then

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.650 
take apart the two strands and then
after<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.350> i'll<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:08.120> loosely<00:03:09.120> separate

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
after that i'll just loosely separate

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.240 
after that i'll just loosely separate
them<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:09.959> my<00:03:10.170> hands<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.739> taking<00:03:14.130> them

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
them with my hands and so taking them

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.009 
them with my hands and so taking them
out<00:03:14.370> i<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.910> really<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.540> results

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
out i actually really like the results

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.640 
out i actually really like the results
of<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.500> band<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:18.350> normally<00:03:19.350> when<00:03:19.500> i<00:03:19.530> do

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
of this band to not normally when i do

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560 
of this band to not normally when i do
it<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.010> stretched<00:03:20.370> hair<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.760> always<00:03:21.150> turns<00:03:21.390> out

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
it on stretched hair it always turns out

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.930 
it on stretched hair it always turns out
much<00:03:21.750> better<00:03:21.930> than<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.320> then<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.489> would<00:03:23.700> when<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
much better than I then it would when I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.840 
much better than I then it would when I
do<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.390> wet<00:03:25.110> hair<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.130> all<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
do it on wet hair so I think all the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.699 
do it on wet hair so I think all the
time<00:03:26.910> when<00:03:27.269> i<00:03:27.299> do<00:03:27.420> my<00:03:27.540> bantu<00:03:28.019> knots<00:03:28.230> i'm<00:03:28.380> always

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
time when i do my bantu knots i'm always

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.990
