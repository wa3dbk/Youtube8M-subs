of people get wrong and that's how to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.570 
of people get wrong and that's how to
run<00:00:15.630> uphill<00:00:15.809> how<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> run<00:00:16.740> uphill<00:00:16.890> properly

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
run uphill how to run uphill properly

run uphill how to run uphill properly
okay<00:00:18.119> now<00:00:18.660> if<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> already<00:00:18.930> avoid<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.560> where

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
okay now if you already avoid one where

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580 
okay now if you already avoid one where
are<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.369> already<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> four<00:00:21.300> foot<00:00:21.539> striker<00:00:21.900> then

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
are you already a four foot striker then

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.870 
are you already a four foot striker then
you're<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> find<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.519> easier

you're going to find this a lot easier
if<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> heel<00:00:24.840> striker<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.980> suggest

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
if you're a heel striker then I suggest

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.830 
if you're a heel striker then I suggest
that<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.449> videos

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that you have a look at my other videos

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.560 
that you have a look at my other videos
too<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> look<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.560> proper<00:00:29.269> landing<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
too have a look at proper landing how to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
too have a look at proper landing how to
learn<00:00:30.810> properly<00:00:31.199> under<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.040> center<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> mass

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
learn properly under your center of mass

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.500 
learn properly under your center of mass
and<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> land<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.480> forefoot<00:00:34.100> okay

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
and how to land on you forefoot okay

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.760 
and how to land on you forefoot okay
essentially<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.350> running<00:00:37.500> along

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
essentially when you're running along

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.700 
essentially when you're running along
the<00:00:37.890> flat<00:00:38.480> heel<00:00:39.480> strike<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.050> although<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the flat heel strike in although it's a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400 
the flat heel strike in although it's a
breaking<00:00:40.950> motion<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.239> by<00:00:42.420> okay<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
breaking motion you will get by okay but

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
breaking motion you will get by okay but
as<00:00:43.469> soon<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.890> gradient<00:00:44.370> comes<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.879> you're

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
as soon as that gradient comes up you're

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
as soon as that gradient comes up you're
going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.570> forced<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.350> land<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.739> four

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
going to be forced to land on your four

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to be forced to land on your four
feet<00:00:47.250> okay<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:47.940> you're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.480> let

feet okay so you're going to be let
forced<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> land<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> correct<00:00:50.399> manner<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
forced to land in the correct manner and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
forced to land in the correct manner and
if<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.539> you're<00:00:51.719> used<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> London<00:00:53.309> with

what<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.580> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
what that's going to do if I do that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.059 
what that's going to do if I do that
right<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.319> first<00:02:10.560> thing<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.739> want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> do

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
right now the first thing I want to do

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.660 
right now the first thing I want to do
is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.699 
is
all<00:02:11.819> forwards<00:02:12.240> okay<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.990> essentially<00:02:13.380> what

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
all forwards okay so essentially what

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.290 
all forwards okay so essentially what
you're<00:02:13.830> doing<00:02:14.130> you're<00:02:14.280> falling<00:02:14.670> forwards<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you're doing you're falling forwards the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.640 
you're doing you're falling forwards the
entire<00:02:15.569> way<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.810> every<00:02:16.140> time<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.470> land

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
entire way and every time you land

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350 
entire way and every time you land
you're<00:02:17.310> sort<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.580> stopping<00:02:17.819> yourself<00:02:17.970> from

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you're sort of stopping yourself from

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
you're sort of stopping yourself from
falling<00:02:18.569> over<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.170> keeping<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.670> propulsion

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
falling over and keeping that propulsion

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.210 
falling over and keeping that propulsion
going<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.870> when<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.170> running<00:02:22.260> uphill<00:02:22.560> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
going now when you're running uphill you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280 
going now when you're running uphill you
want<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.580> slightly<00:02:23.910> shorter<00:02:24.780> steps<00:02:25.080> than

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
want to take slightly shorter steps than

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.850 
want to take slightly shorter steps than
you're<00:02:25.410> used<00:02:25.440> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you're used to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.559 
you're used to
okay<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> make<00:02:27.060> sure<00:02:27.120> your<00:02:27.420> knees

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
okay you want to make sure your knees

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.120 
okay you want to make sure your knees
are<00:02:27.599> coming<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.080> nice<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.260> high<00:02:28.470> not

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
are coming up nice and high not

are coming up nice and high not
ridiculously<00:02:29.700> high<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.239> like

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
ridiculously high so you're not like

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
ridiculously high so you're not like
bringing<00:02:30.690> them<00:02:30.840> above<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.410> waist<00:02:31.620> or

anything but your needs are coming up
higher<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.850> strike<00:02:36.330> you're

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
higher and with your strike you're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
higher and with your strike you're
landing<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.920> little<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.640> harder<00:02:39.060> than<00:02:39.300> you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
landing a little bit harder than you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.699 
landing a little bit harder than you
normally<00:02:39.540> would<00:02:39.780> okay<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.170> you're<00:02:40.470> really

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
normally would okay so you're really

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.240 
normally would okay so you're really
digging<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.700> slightly<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.890> center

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
digging in slightly more on the center

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.030 
digging in slightly more on the center
of<00:02:44.370> mass<00:02:44.550> okay<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.200> obviously<00:02:46.440> kick

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
of mass okay and then you obviously kick

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
of mass okay and then you obviously kick
him<00:02:47.220> back<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.819> way<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.030> normally<00:02:48.450> would

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
him back just the way you normally would

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.380 
him back just the way you normally would
up<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.860> hill<00:02:50.040> okay<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:51.030> keeping<00:02:51.299> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
up the hill okay you're keeping that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.640 
up the hill okay you're keeping that
relaxed<00:02:51.870> very<00:02:52.350> short<00:02:52.739> choppy<00:02:54.200> strides<00:02:55.200> up<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
relaxed very short choppy strides up the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.949 
relaxed very short choppy strides up the
hill<00:02:55.830> making<00:02:56.580> sure<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:56.940> knees<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.810> of

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
hill making sure your knees kind of

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.320 
hill making sure your knees kind of
coming<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.470> nice<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.709> high<00:02:59.000> okay<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.209> that's

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
coming up nice and high okay and that's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.150 
coming up nice and high okay and that's
going<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> keep<00:03:00.690> me<00:03:00.870> keep<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.319> moving<00:03:01.470> keep

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
going to keep me keep you moving keep

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.620 
going to keep me keep you moving keep
gravity<00:03:02.700> sort<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.060> pulling<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.480> forward

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
gravity sort of pulling you forward

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
gravity sort of pulling you forward
towards<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> hill<00:03:04.560> rather<00:03:05.100> than<00:03:05.310> pulling<00:03:05.519> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
towards the hill rather than pulling you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
towards the hill rather than pulling you
backwards<00:03:06.180> okay<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.350> gravity<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.769> pulling

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
backwards okay so if gravity is pulling

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.680 
backwards okay so if gravity is pulling
you<00:03:08.100> forward<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.670> immediately<00:03:09.030> easier<00:03:09.420> if

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
you forward it's immediately easier if

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.360 
you forward it's immediately easier if
you're<00:03:09.870> London<00:03:10.200> your<00:03:10.680> feet<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:10.980> front<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.250> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you're London your feet in front of you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.009 
you're London your feet in front of you
gravity<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.940> pulling<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.269> back<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
gravity is pulling you back in it's a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.229 
gravity is pulling you back in it's a
hundred<00:03:13.290> times<00:03:13.440> harder<00:03:13.830> okay<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.030> want<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
hundred times harder okay so you want to

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.410 
hundred times harder okay so you want to
keep<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.510> quick<00:03:16.170> choppy<00:03:16.920> short<00:03:17.760> stride

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
keep that quick choppy short stride

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.990 
keep that quick choppy short stride
that's<00:03:18.930> going<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.140> push<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.010> forward<00:03:20.250> rather

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that's going to push you forward rather

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.720 
that's going to push you forward rather

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
repeats if you've got a nice he'll need

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.569 
repeats if you've got a nice he'll need
burning<00:03:31.200> some<00:03:31.350> Hill<00:03:31.530> repeats<00:03:31.859> maybe<00:03:32.100> once<00:03:32.370> per

burning some Hill repeats maybe once per

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.210 
burning some Hill repeats maybe once per
week<00:03:32.930> what<00:03:33.930> you'll<00:03:34.049> find<00:03:34.290> once<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.100> to

week what you'll find once you get to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.729 
week what you'll find once you get to
the<00:03:35.310> top<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.640> hill<00:03:36.000> actually<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:37.260> form

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
the top of that hill actually your form

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.729 
the top of that hill actually your form
has<00:03:38.400> been<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.940> point<00:03:39.570> if<00:03:39.959> you're<00:03:40.230> you're

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
has been on point if you're you're

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.670 
has been on point if you're you're
forced<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.370> run<00:03:41.670> with<00:03:42.000> good<00:03:42.180> form<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.810> hill<00:03:43.170> so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
forced to run with good form up hill so

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.229 
forced to run with good form up hill so
when<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.890> get<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> top<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.670> hill<00:03:44.850> even

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
when you get to the top of the hill even

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.729 
when you get to the top of the hill even
though<00:03:45.510> you're<00:03:45.660> tired<00:03:45.900> from<00:03:46.260> running<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
though you're tired from running up the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.500 
though you're tired from running up the
hill<00:03:46.769> you'll<00:03:47.489> actually<00:03:47.640> find<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.209> running

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
hill you'll actually find your running

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.240 
hill you'll actually find your running
gait<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.049> your<00:03:49.200> pace<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.769> all<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.950> rest<00:03:50.130> of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
gait and your pace and all the rest of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.340 
gait and your pace and all the rest of
it<00:03:50.370> much<00:03:50.609> easier<00:03:50.880> because<00:03:51.870> your<00:03:52.049> body<00:03:52.260> has

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it much easier because your body has

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.810 
it much easier because your body has
been<00:03:52.650> forced<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.040> run<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.489> correct<00:03:53.760> way

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
been forced to run in the correct way

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.789 
been forced to run in the correct way
okay<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.989> you'll<00:03:55.140> get<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> top<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.739> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
okay so you'll get to the top of the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.380 
okay so you'll get to the top of the
hill<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.459> order<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.790> sudden<00:03:57.090> even<00:03:57.299> though

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
hill in order the sudden even though

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.729 
hill in order the sudden even though
you're<00:03:57.540> tired<00:03:57.720> you're<00:03:58.140> breathing<00:03:58.470> might<00:03:58.620> be

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
you're tired you're breathing might be

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.380 
you're tired you're breathing might be
slightly<00:03:58.980> elevated<00:03:59.160> you're<00:04:00.090> actually

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
slightly elevated you're actually

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.620 
slightly elevated you're actually
running<00:04:00.569> much<00:04:01.230> easier<00:04:01.650> much<00:04:02.010> quicker<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.700> and

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
running much easier much quicker and and

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.240 
running much easier much quicker and and
everything<00:04:04.380> starts<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.799> really<00:04:05.010> come

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
everything starts to really come

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
everything starts to really come
together<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.000> more<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.299> run<00:04:06.450> up<00:04:06.569> hills

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
together and the more you run up hills

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.930 
together and the more you run up hills
the<00:04:07.350> more<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.739> will<00:04:07.889> just<00:04:08.069> start<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.730> gel

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
the more that will just start to gel

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.900 
the more that will just start to gel
naturally<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.510> your<00:04:09.540> mind<00:04:10.100> okay<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.760> in

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
naturally in your mind okay so in

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.059

you<00:04:46.350> up<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.590> hill<00:04:46.620> okay<00:04:47.520> it's<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.210> technique

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
you up the hill okay it's a technique

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.870 
you up the hill okay it's a technique
it's<00:04:49.170> an<00:04:49.290> art<00:04:49.470> form<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:50.190> more<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.490> try<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.730> the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
it's an art form the more you try it the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.760 
it's an art form the more you try it the
better<00:04:51.300> you'll<00:04:51.540> get<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.200> seriously

better you'll get at it I seriously

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.920 
better you'll get at it I seriously
recommend<00:04:52.920> doing<00:04:53.790> Hill<00:04:54.030> repeats<00:04:54.390> find<00:04:54.780> in

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
recommend doing Hill repeats find in

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.660 
recommend doing Hill repeats find in
somewhere<00:04:55.230> hilly<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.590> run<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.430> going<00:04:56.610> to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
somewhere hilly to run it's going to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.370 
somewhere hilly to run it's going to
increase<00:04:56.910> your<00:04:57.180> vo2<00:04:57.330> max<00:04:57.900> it's<00:04:58.230> just

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
increase your vo2 max it's just

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.230 
increase your vo2 max it's just
brilliant<00:04:58.920> for<00:04:59.070> your<00:04:59.160> technique<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.730> you've
