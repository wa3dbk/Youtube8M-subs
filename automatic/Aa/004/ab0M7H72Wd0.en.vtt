00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
draft picks and i think it's it's more

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
draft picks and i think it's it's more
about<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.859> program<00:00:32.160> overall<00:00:32.790> than<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
about the program overall than it is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.280 
about the program overall than it is
about<00:00:34.640> necessarily<00:00:35.640> who<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> coach<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.570> or

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
about necessarily who the coach is or

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.670 
about necessarily who the coach is or
any<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.070> individual<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:40.200> winning<00:00:40.440> that's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
any one individual the winning that's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.990 
any one individual the winning that's
occurred<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> last<00:00:41.640> several

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
occurred here over the last several

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
occurred here over the last several
years<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.809> goes<00:00:42.989> hand<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.320> hand<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
years I think goes hand in hand with the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.790 
years I think goes hand in hand with the
fact<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> Eric<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> Larry<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:45.899> I've<00:00:46.649> been

doorstep of playing in the NBA so it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
doorstep of playing in the NBA so it's
something<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> should<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> smile<00:01:26.490> on

and<00:01:34.680> his<00:01:34.860> pre-draft<00:01:35.159> regimen<00:01:36.000> he's<00:01:36.570> really

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and his pre-draft regimen he's really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
and his pre-draft regimen he's really
put<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> lot<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> effort<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.430> his

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
put a lot of time and effort into his

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
put a lot of time and effort into his
game<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:40.170> number<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> keep

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
game and then number three just to keep

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.719 
game and then number three just to keep
a<00:01:41.729> hunger<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> humility<00:01:43.380> level<00:01:43.979> even

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a hunger and a humility level even

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
a hunger and a humility level even

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
though there's going to be so much

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.480
