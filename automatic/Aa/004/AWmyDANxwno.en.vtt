refractometer now what's a refractometer

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.500 
refractometer now what's a refractometer
it<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> device<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.580> helps<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:22.880> take<00:00:23.880> your

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
it is a device that helps you take your

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
it is a device that helps you take your
salinity<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.470> specific<00:00:26.430> gravity<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> your

all<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.760> mistakes<00:01:00.180> come<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.809> YouTube<00:01:01.199> but

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
all my mistakes come out on YouTube but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.529 
all my mistakes come out on YouTube but
you'll<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.670> able<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> learn<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.180> them

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you'll be able to learn from them

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.850 
you'll be able to learn from them
instead<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.409> great<00:01:04.589> saltwater<00:01:05.100> tank<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
instead of a great saltwater tank so

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
instead of a great saltwater tank so
refractometer<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> more

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
refractometer now it's one of the more

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
refractometer now it's one of the more
expensive<00:01:09.930> pieces<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.040> equipment<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.729> might

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
expensive pieces of equipment you might

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
expensive pieces of equipment you might
need<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.689> saltwater<00:01:13.170> tank<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> can

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
need for a saltwater tank now you can

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.210 
need for a saltwater tank now you can
use<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> hydrometer<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:16.020> cheap<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.710> think

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
use a hydrometer it's very cheap I think

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
use a hydrometer it's very cheap I think
it's<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.759> eight<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.659> nine<00:01:18.810> dollars<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it's like eight or nine dollars at the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's like eight or nine dollars at the
fish<00:01:20.460> store<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> works<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.799> fine<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
fish store and it works just fine it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
fish store and it works just fine it's
just<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.970> accurate<00:01:24.229> now<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.500> refractometer

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
just not as accurate now a refractometer

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
just not as accurate now a refractometer
like<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.850> said<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.360> gonna<00:01:27.509> show<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> right

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
like I said I'm gonna show you right

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
like I said I'm gonna show you right
here<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:29.009> measures<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.490> specific<00:01:30.479> gravity

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
here it measures your specific gravity

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
here it measures your specific gravity
and<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.439> salinity<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.240> great<00:01:33.450> piece

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and your salinity now it's a great piece

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
and your salinity now it's a great piece
of<00:01:33.689> equipment<00:01:34.159> looks<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> looks<00:01:35.939> like

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
of equipment looks like this looks like

salinity<00:03:35.250> was<00:03:35.610> high<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.720> what<00:03:37.020> did<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.230> do

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
salinity was high so what did I do

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.460 
salinity was high so what did I do
I<00:03:37.650> took<00:03:38.190> some<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.300> water<00:03:39.660> out<00:03:39.989> now<00:03:40.320> I'd

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
I took some of this water out now I'd

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.530 
I took some of this water out now I'd
into<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.770> water<00:03:41.100> change<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.730> mean<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.360> could

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
into a water change I mean you could

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.900 
into a water change I mean you could
consider<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.110> kind<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.590> water<00:03:43.770> change<00:03:43.980> but

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
consider it a kind of a water change but

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.970 
consider it a kind of a water change but
what<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.060> did<00:03:45.270> was<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.600> started<00:03:45.660> by<00:03:46.170> taking<00:03:46.380> four

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
what I did was I started by taking four

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.970 
what I did was I started by taking four
cups<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.550> my<00:03:47.940> aquarium<00:03:48.630> water<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.440> putting

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
cups of my aquarium water out in putting

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.690 
cups of my aquarium water out in putting
four<00:03:50.489> cups<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.260> ro/di<00:03:52.260> water<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:53.010> which<00:03:53.489> is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
four cups of ro/di water in which is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.630 
four cups of ro/di water in which is
your<00:03:53.970> fresh<00:03:54.330> water<00:03:54.630> not<00:03:55.440> salt<00:03:55.860> water<00:03:56.070> mix<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
your fresh water not salt water mix and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.960 
your fresh water not salt water mix and
then<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.510> tested<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.050> again<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.560> my<00:03:59.430> salinity

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
then I tested it again and my salinity

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.070 
then I tested it again and my salinity
dropped<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:01.440> tiny<00:04:02.040> bit<00:04:02.250> more<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.450> took<00:04:03.720> four

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
dropped a tiny bit more so I took four

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.460 
dropped a tiny bit more so I took four
more<00:04:04.350> cups<00:04:04.650> out<00:04:04.860> put<00:04:05.580> four<00:04:06.060> more<00:04:06.420> cups<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:07.080> our

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
more cups out put four more cups of our

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.330 
more cups out put four more cups of our
ODI<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.790> my<00:04:09.600> salinity<00:04:10.200> was<00:04:10.500> right<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
ODI in and my salinity was right on the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.030 
ODI in and my salinity was right on the
money<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:12.300> was<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.820> 1.0<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.970> six<00:04:15.570> or

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
money it was right on 1.0 to six or

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.300 
money it was right on 1.0 to six or
thirty-five<00:04:17.090> PPT<00:04:18.090> now<00:04:19.080> that's<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.799> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
thirty-five PPT now that's like the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.279 
thirty-five PPT now that's like the
threshold<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.210> can<00:04:21.299> go<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> little<00:04:21.900> bit<00:04:22.080> lower

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
threshold you can go a little bit lower

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.140 
threshold you can go a little bit lower
especially<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:23.130> you're<00:04:23.220> getting<00:04:23.340> corals<00:04:23.940> you

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
especially if you're getting corals you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.690 
especially if you're getting corals you
want<00:04:24.360> it

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
want it

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.120 
want it
the<00:04:24.820> tiny<00:04:25.600> bit<00:04:25.840> lower<00:04:26.020> than<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.290> but<00:04:26.770> I'm

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the tiny bit lower than that but I'm

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.380 
the tiny bit lower than that but I'm
right<00:04:27.520> on<00:04:27.670> where<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.120> need<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.420> and<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.770> know
