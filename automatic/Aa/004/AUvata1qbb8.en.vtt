00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all right 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.900
 or not 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.360
 I had previously made a top with 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.420
 10 most rare and expensive video games 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.310
 world but I realized something that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 there are more games that do not add in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 previous top that the approximate value that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 reach the top 3 of this new 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 top surpass the nintendo world 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.829
 championship in its gray edition in this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.169
 I will present to you the second part 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.140
 with the 10 most rare and expensive games of 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.730
 I just want to add that in this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 top we will see games a little more 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.469
 accessible that the 10 video games of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 previous top although of course there will be some 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.340
 very difficult games to find 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 due to its limited number of units 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.899
 or because it's a special version of that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.340
 video game without more to add 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.800
 let's start 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.130
 number 10 on the list takes it 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.920
 bounty 'boves trick back of atari 5200 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.200
 this game was very popular in its time 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.019
 due to the theme of the game that was 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.270
 to look for treasures the curious thing about this 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.520
 title is that over time the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.580
 number of cartridges this game has gone 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 decreasing over the years the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 reason why this cartridge is so 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.400
 weird is due to the poster that comes 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.140
 included with the game in which you 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.270
 showed the locations of the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.940
 different treasures that you had to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 find in the game being this game 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.830
 the only one in the atari catalog in 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.410
 own this style of posters is known for 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.370
 the existence of only 5 cartridges and its 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.580
 estimated price is about 500 dollars 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.460
 the number 9 is for me the strong 2 for 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 the bed trex console this game is one of 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.720
 the rarest of the trex bird catalog 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.660
 because it was not marketed as 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.060
 game in the beginning this game was coming 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.340
 included inside the console as a game 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.370
 of demonstration but had many failures 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.590
 ebooks at the end the creative company of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.150
 the trex network pulled a version of this 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.370
 game in cartridge with errors 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.370
 corrected for the people who 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.440
 ask for this version was very limited and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 with the passage of time they have been lost 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.480
 several copies it is believed that 10 copies of 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.250
 this game are left in existence and their 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.230
 approximate value in the market for 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.959
 collectors is about 700 dollars 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.569
 and virtual bowling for the virtual boy is 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.549
 number 8 on the list this is one of 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.799
 the few games that the owners of 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.930
 a virtual boy they asked nintendo 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.360
 due to the low sales of said 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.549
 console this version did not have good 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.680
 sales because it was marketed in 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.440
 another game similar to virtual bowling 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.510
 called nest the funky bowling because of 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 limited number of copies of this game 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 it is believed that there are only 17 copies of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 this game its approximate value is of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.560
 about $ 900 the number 7 on the list 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.989
 is for meo geo metal slug like 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.870
 many will know metal slug is one of the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.099
 most popular arcade games 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 due to the popularity of the first 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.750
 title in the recreational and the low 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 sales of its neo geo console decided 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.540
 Take out a homemade version of said game 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.340
 thinking that his console would sell more 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.709
 unfortunately both the console and the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.090
 game did not meet the expectations of 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.910
 sales that the neo geo company 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.010
 speculated it is known of the existence of 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.540
 50 copies of the game and its value 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.490
 approximate in the market of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.140
 collectors 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.930
 about a thousand dollars 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.950
 Number 6 on the list is for Pepsi 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.930
 atarders of atari 5200 this title was 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.900
 a hard attack on the pepsi by part of 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.360
 coca cola in the 80s this game is 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.490
 very similar to space invaders but with 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
 the difference that in this game does not 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.510
 shoot Martians but they 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.030
 you shoot some letters that make up the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.920
 word pecs and this version is only 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.440
 distributed a limited number of copies 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.569
 because of the controversy that could result 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.730
 for coca-cola it is known from the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.890
 existence of only 15 copies of this 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.569
 game and its estimated price is about 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.480
 1200 dollars 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.920
 a star wars walk adventure is the number 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.780
 5 of the list in 1983 was promoted 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.840
 in the park brothers catalog with the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.970
 resell name and the reason why 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.859
 this stalled cartridge is because the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.960
 game was canceled due to the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.180
 controls so difficult that the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.699
 game the game designer 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.770
 larri hellberg kept the only copy 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.500
 of the game that he then gave it to his 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.360
 son who sold at auction his 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.169
 approximate value is about two thousand 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.210
 dollars the number 4 on the list is for 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.620
 Mr. Boston created a suite for 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.780
 console bet 3 in 1983 the company's 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.759
 liquor called mister boston launched a 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.759
 special edition of the game clear suite 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.080
 in small quantities unlike 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.360
 the original version in which 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.310
 we controlled a vacuum cleaner in this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.039
 special edition we controlled a 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.630
 hat though the data about this 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.370
 Cartridge are scarce 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.370
 it is believed that three copies of this game 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.910
 their approximate value remains in existence 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.580
 it's about three thousand dollars 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.710
 number 3 on the list is taken by one 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.160
 of the most rare and expensive pc games 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.070
 that have been recorded last escape from 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.810
 mount drive originally created as 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.120
 part of the series of games saw 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.460
 adventure for the old computer 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.880
 big 20 the game was programmed by a 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.350
 friend of the creator of the last series 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.720
 originally about 3,000 were launched 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.780
 copies of the game with the hope that it 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.480
 they sold all unfortunately only 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.460
 they sold about 100 copies the rumors 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.620
 they say that like the storage costs 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.510
 they were expensive for the time they decided 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.750
 bury the games at the foot of a 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.520
 mountain to never know more of them 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.800
 it is currently believed that at least 13 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.630
 copies are left in existence and less than 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.390
 half are in conditions 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.360
 complete have been sold in the market of 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.000
 collectors at about 3600 dollars 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.669
 in number 2 on the list we have another 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.409
 strange and priceless article are the 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.360
 nintendo power 694 cards in 1994 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.460
 nintendo wanted to repeat what they had 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.569
 made in the nintendo world championship 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.699
 of 1990 but only in the USA this micro 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.919
 platelet has a certain resemblance to the 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.569
 nintendo campus challenge although with 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.610
 certain differences between both 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.639
 versions like the fact that the power 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.530
 694 was of a larger size and 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.229
 contained the following versions of 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.539
 competition the games are super 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.529
 mariobros of lost levels super mario 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:43.120
 kart and kendry fin junior senior baseball 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:45.159
 currently it is known of the existence of 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.100
 a single micro platelet and its price 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:51.100
 estimated is about 10 thousand dollars 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.590
 and the number 1 of this top is the cartridge 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.440
 of art walk in its prototype version for 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.680
 the super nintendo heart ball is one of 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.780
 the most popular rpg sagas from the snes to 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.580
 difference from the Japanese version the 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.430
 American version only sold a number 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.950
 limited copies this version differs 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.870
 of the commercial version due to certain 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.910
 factors that make it unique in this top 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.160
 like the fact of being a beta 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.170
 from the same game and be a cartridge of 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.240
 test in the creation of art world what 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.730
 that allowed to test some elements of 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.430
 the beta version and be able to test the game 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.050
 before you can market it this 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.360
 game is a holy grail for the 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.160
 collectors of the genre rpg in 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.070
