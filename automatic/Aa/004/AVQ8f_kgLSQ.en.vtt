divided by ten becomes a perfect square
which<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.009> following<00:01:13.190> can<00:01:13.580> possibly<00:01:14.119> be

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
which of the following can possibly be

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.570 
which of the following can possibly be
one<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.690> these<00:01:14.869> four<00:01:15.229> numbers<00:01:15.310> now<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:16.460> are

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
one of these four numbers now there are

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.279 
one of these four numbers now there are
two<00:01:16.789> ways<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.060> can<00:01:17.299> do<00:01:17.479> these<00:01:17.659> questions

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
two ways you can do these questions

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.960 
two ways you can do these questions
these<00:01:18.590> type<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.860> questions<00:01:19.100> either<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.700> go<00:01:19.850> by

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
these type of questions either you go by

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.359 
these type of questions either you go by
the<00:01:20.119> algebra<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.619> assume<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.190> you

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
the algebra you just assume that you

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.010 
the algebra you just assume that you
know<00:01:22.399> one<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.759> numbers<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> X<00:01:23.479> there<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
know one of the numbers is X there the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.160 
know one of the numbers is X there the
number<00:01:24.229> be<00:01:24.380> X<00:01:24.530> plus<00:01:24.770> 2<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:25.220> index<00:01:25.550> plus<00:01:25.789> 4<00:01:26.179> but

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
number be X plus 2 then index plus 4 but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.660 
number be X plus 2 then index plus 4 but
that<00:01:27.560> will<00:01:27.890> not<00:01:28.159> give<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> answer

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
that will not give you the answer

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.160 
that will not give you the answer
because<00:01:29.119> he's<00:01:29.270> asking<00:01:29.659> which<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:29.990> ones

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
because he's asking which of the ones

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.410 
because he's asking which of the ones
can<00:01:30.530> possibly<00:01:31.190> be<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.880> four<00:01:32.060> numbers

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
can possibly be one of the four numbers

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.279 
can possibly be one of the four numbers
and<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.319> don't<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.770> an<00:01:33.979> exact<00:01:34.670> equation

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
and you don't have an exact equation

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.510 
and you don't have an exact equation
which<00:01:36.289> is<00:01:36.409> becoming<00:01:36.800> which<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.159> giving<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
which is becoming which is giving you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.370 
which is becoming which is giving you
the<00:01:37.640> answer<00:01:38.000> straight<00:01:38.330> away<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.080> it's<00:01:39.200> always

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
the answer straight away so it's always

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.740 
the answer straight away so it's always
good<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:40.069> use<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.819> options<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.539> such

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
good to use the options in such

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.320 
good to use the options in such
questions<00:01:42.259> however<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.729> question<00:01:44.210> is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
questions however in this question is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.200 
questions however in this question is
asking<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.840> which<00:01:45.020> one<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:45.470> work<00:01:45.679> which<00:01:46.310> can

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
asking you which one this work which can

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
asking you which one this work which can
be<00:01:47.600> one<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.990> four<00:01:48.200> numbers<00:01:48.470> which<00:01:48.860> means

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
be one of the four numbers which means

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.399 
be one of the four numbers which means
that<00:01:49.490> each<00:01:50.030> option<00:01:50.509> will<00:01:50.690> give<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:51.049> four

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that each option will give you four

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.219 
that each option will give you four
possible<00:01:52.130> different<00:01:53.000> scenarios<00:01:53.720> right<00:01:54.020> you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
possible different scenarios right you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.779 
possible different scenarios right you
can<00:01:54.380> assume<00:01:54.829> though<00:01:55.070> if<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.399> assume<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
can assume though if you assume the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.789 
can assume though if you assume the
first<00:01:56.030> option<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.509> be<00:01:56.630> true<00:01:56.960> then<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.590> can

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
first option to be true then you can

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.779 
first option to be true then you can
take<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.159> numbers<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.610> be<00:01:58.700> 21<00:01:59.030> 23<00:01:59.570> 27<00:01:59.630> 29<00:02:00.439> 19<00:02:01.430> 21

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
take the numbers to be 21 23 27 29 19 21

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.840 
take the numbers to be 21 23 27 29 19 21
23<00:02:01.969> 25<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.860> take<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.250> numbers<00:02:04.640> like

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
23 25 so you can take the numbers like

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.240 
23 25 so you can take the numbers like
this<00:02:05.119> which<00:02:05.329> means<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.930> each<00:02:06.590> option<00:02:07.009> giving

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
this which means that each option giving

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.069 
this which means that each option giving
you<00:02:07.340> four<00:02:07.579> possibilities<00:02:08.269> for<00:02:08.539> up<00:02:08.750> five

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
you four possibilities for up five

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.069 
you four possibilities for up five
options<00:02:09.289> giving<00:02:09.769> you<00:02:10.209> 20<00:02:11.209> possibility<00:02:11.870> so

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
options giving you 20 possibility so

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.900 
options giving you 20 possibility so
that's<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.070> scenario<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:13.790> we

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's not the scenario that's not we

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.130 
that's not the scenario that's not we
should<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.150> taking<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.870> means<00:02:15.049> you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
should be taking so that means you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.449 
should be taking so that means you
should<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.350> working<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.950> question<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.340> little

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
should be working the question a little

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.970 
should be working the question a little
bit<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.600> using<00:02:18.109> the<00:02:18.230> option<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:18.769> he's

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
bit and then using the option now he's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.940 
bit and then using the option now he's
saying<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.549> sum<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.570> four<00:02:20.989> consecutive<00:02:21.290> odd

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
saying that sum of four consecutive odd

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.000 
saying that sum of four consecutive odd
integers<00:02:22.579> when<00:02:23.239> divided<00:02:23.810> by<00:02:23.989> 10<00:02:24.320> gives<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.980> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
integers when divided by 10 gives you a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.449 
integers when divided by 10 gives you a
perfect<00:02:25.760> square<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.720> means<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:28.070> sum

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
perfect square that means that the sum

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.960 
perfect square that means that the sum
over<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:29.150> must<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:30.410> divisible<00:02:30.769> by<00:02:31.100> 10<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
over here must be divisible by 10 that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.360 
over here must be divisible by 10 that
means<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.480> sum<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.780> four<00:02:33.290> consecutive<00:02:33.590> odd

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
means the sum of four consecutive odd

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.229 
means the sum of four consecutive odd
integers<00:02:35.209> must<00:02:35.989> give<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:37.130> number<00:02:37.609> which<00:02:38.060> is

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
integers must give you a number which is

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.259 
integers must give you a number which is
divisible<00:02:38.630> by<00:02:38.930> 10<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.250> list<00:02:40.579> down<00:02:40.940> all

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
divisible by 10 so if I list down all

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.530 
divisible by 10 so if I list down all
the<00:02:41.900> possible<00:02:42.560> odd<00:02:42.829> numbers<00:02:43.700> which<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.239> come

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the possible odd numbers which can come

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
the possible odd numbers which can come
as<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.140> digit<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> number<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.640> be

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
as your in digit for the number to be

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
as your in digit for the number to be
divisible<00:02:47.000> by<00:02:47.239> 10<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.810> should<00:02:48.170> get<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.560> zero<00:02:49.069> at

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
divisible by 10 I should get a zero at

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.030 
divisible by 10 I should get a zero at
the<00:02:49.340> end<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.329> let's<00:02:50.359> stream<00:02:50.840> what<00:02:51.109> all<00:02:51.380> four

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the end so let's stream what all four

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.930 
the end so let's stream what all four
numbers

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
numbers

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.199 
numbers
consecutive<00:02:53.600> should<00:02:54.500> give<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.579> sum<00:02:55.880> 10

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
consecutive should give you the sum 10

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.530 
consecutive should give you the sum 10
so<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.470> three<00:02:57.949> five<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.549> seven

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
so if I have one three five and seven

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.000 
so if I have one three five and seven
that<00:02:59.810> gives<00:03:00.079> me<00:03:00.169> only<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.859> 12<00:03:01.400> plus<00:03:01.669> four

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that gives me only is 12 plus four

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.059 
that gives me only is 12 plus four
at<00:03:02.069> 16<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.939> is<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.330> divisible<00:03:03.659> by<00:03:03.900> 10<00:03:04.439> if<00:03:04.830> I

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
at 16 that is not divisible by 10 if I

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.479 
at 16 that is not divisible by 10 if I
use<00:03:05.280> three<00:03:05.790> five<00:03:06.360> seven<00:03:06.900> nine<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:08.010> gives<00:03:08.280> me

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
use three five seven nine that gives me

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.850 
use three five seven nine that gives me
eight<00:03:08.790> eight<00:03:09.150> plus<00:03:09.510> sixteen<00:03:10.200> again<00:03:10.530> which<00:03:10.709> is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
eight eight plus sixteen again which is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.970 
eight eight plus sixteen again which is
not<00:03:11.040> divisible<00:03:11.400> by<00:03:11.640> 10<00:03:12.000> if<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.689> use<00:03:12.930> five<00:03:13.319> seven

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
not divisible by 10 if I use five seven

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.929 
not divisible by 10 if I use five seven
nine<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.879> that<00:03:15.540> gives<00:03:15.810> me<00:03:16.019> 5<00:03:16.739> +<00:03:16.980> 7<00:03:17.129> 12<00:03:17.640> 10

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
nine and one that gives me 5 + 7 12 10

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.660 
nine and one that gives me 5 + 7 12 10
12<00:03:18.329> plus<00:03:18.599> 10<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.989> 22<00:03:19.500> which<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.739> also<00:03:20.129> not

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
12 plus 10 is 22 which is also not

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.740 
12 plus 10 is 22 which is also not
divisible<00:03:21.180> by<00:03:21.450> 10<00:03:21.870> however<00:03:22.650> if<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.190> use<00:03:23.750> seven

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
divisible by 10 however if I use seven

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.699 
divisible by 10 however if I use seven
if<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.379> use<00:03:25.650> nine<00:03:26.099> if<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.909> use<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.470> use

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
if I use nine if I use one and if I use

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.800 
if I use nine if I use one and if I use
3<00:03:29.159> so<00:03:29.819> 9<00:03:30.030> plus<00:03:30.090> 7<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.930> 16<00:03:31.470> 16<00:03:31.709> plus<00:03:32.189> 4<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.640> 20<00:03:33.269> that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
3 so 9 plus 7 is 16 16 plus 4 is 20 that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.099 
3 so 9 plus 7 is 16 16 plus 4 is 20 that
will<00:03:34.230> give<00:03:34.470> me<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:35.010> number<00:03:35.879> which<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.690> divisible

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
will give me a number which is divisible

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.910 
will give me a number which is divisible
by<00:03:37.470> 10<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.030> means<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:40.079> digits<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.680> last

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
by 10 so that means the digits the last

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.599 
by 10 so that means the digits the last
digits<00:03:41.400> must<00:03:41.670> be<00:03:41.879> 7<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.420> 9<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.470> then<00:03:44.069> 1<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
digits must be 7 and 9 and then 1 and

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.690 
digits must be 7 and 9 and then 1 and
then<00:03:45.030> 3<00:03:45.349> these<00:03:46.349> numbers<00:03:46.889> these<00:03:47.159> numbers<00:03:47.519> will

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
then 3 these numbers these numbers will

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.339 
then 3 these numbers these numbers will
be<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.909> consecutive<00:03:48.209> odd<00:03:48.659> numbers<00:03:49.109> which

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
be the consecutive odd numbers which

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.309 
be the consecutive odd numbers which
will<00:03:49.560> give<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.040> sum<00:03:50.430> will<00:03:50.639> give<00:03:50.849> you

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
will give you the sum will give you

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.649 
will give you the sum will give you
number<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.590> divisible<00:03:52.889> by<00:03:53.190> 10<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.299> let<00:03:54.480> me

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
number to be divisible by 10 so let me

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.629 
number to be divisible by 10 so let me
go<00:03:54.810> ahead<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.170> use<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.739> first<00:03:56.069> option<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
go ahead and use the first option that

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.569 
go ahead and use the first option that
is<00:03:56.879> 21<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.870> means<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.349> number<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.799> 21<00:03:59.159> this

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
is 21 that means this number is 21 this

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.649 
is 21 that means this number is 21 this
number<00:03:59.879> is<00:03:59.970> 23

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
number is 23

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.740 
number is 23
this<00:04:01.260> number<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.680> 19<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:02.790> number<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.209> 17

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
this number is 19 and this number is 17

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.710 
this number is 19 and this number is 17
if<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.319> add<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.069> numbers<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.700> becomes<00:04:06.419> 80

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
if I add all the numbers it becomes 80

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.319 
if I add all the numbers it becomes 80
which<00:04:07.169> is<00:04:07.199> not<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.370> number<00:04:08.549> I'm<00:04:08.879> looking<00:04:09.150> for

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
which is not the number I'm looking for

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.539 
which is not the number I'm looking for
because<00:04:09.599> 80<00:04:09.840> divided<00:04:10.379> by<00:04:10.500> 10<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
because 80 divided by 10 is not a

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.619 
because 80 divided by 10 is not a
perfect<00:04:12.060> square

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
perfect square

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.140 
perfect square
okay<00:04:13.199> let's<00:04:13.680> try<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.010> second<00:04:14.489> number<00:04:14.790> you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
okay let's try the second number you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.879 
okay let's try the second number you
don't<00:04:15.299> even<00:04:15.510> need<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.989> try<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.260> second<00:04:16.680> number

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
don't even need to try the second number

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.830 
don't even need to try the second number
because<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.400> second<00:04:17.760> number<00:04:17.940> has<00:04:18.150> 5<00:04:18.479> at<00:04:18.690> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
because the second number has 5 at the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.319 
because the second number has 5 at the
end<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.320> none<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.530> our<00:04:19.799> numbers<00:04:20.160> has<00:04:20.400> 5<00:04:20.669> @v<00:04:20.970> n

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
end and none of our numbers has 5 @v n

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.750 
end and none of our numbers has 5 @v n
that<00:04:21.930> means<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.500> second<00:04:23.010> option<00:04:23.400> is

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that means that second option is

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.050 
that means that second option is
automatically<00:04:24.570> gone<00:04:25.440> away<00:04:25.740> let's<00:04:26.340> try<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.729> use

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
automatically gone away let's try to use

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240 
automatically gone away let's try to use
the<00:04:27.389> third<00:04:27.690> option<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.320> third<00:04:28.560> option<00:04:28.830> says

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
the third option the third option says

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.110 
the third option the third option says
41

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
41

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.680 
41
that<00:04:30.660> means<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.169> is<00:04:31.410> 41<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.820> number<00:04:33.539> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
that means this is 41 this number the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.839 
that means this is 41 this number the
next<00:04:33.810> number<00:04:34.139> would<00:04:34.260> be<00:04:34.320> 43<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.550> number

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
next number would be 43 the number

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.420 
next number would be 43 the number
before<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.449> would<00:04:36.660> be<00:04:36.810> 39<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.160> number

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
before that would be 39 and the number

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.150 
before that would be 39 and the number
before<00:04:38.789> that<00:04:39.000> would<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.300> 37<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:40.800> you<00:04:40.919> add

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
before that would be 37 so if you add

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.370 
before that would be 37 so if you add
you<00:04:41.460> already<00:04:41.760> know<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.180> 7<00:04:42.630> plus<00:04:42.750> 9<00:04:42.990> plus<00:04:43.050> 1

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
you already know that 7 plus 9 plus 1

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.760 
you already know that 7 plus 9 plus 1
plus<00:04:43.530> these<00:04:43.860> third<00:04:44.250> 20<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.300> 4<00:04:45.570> plus<00:04:45.780> 4<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.020> 8<00:04:46.289> 8

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
plus these third 20 so 4 plus 4 is 8 8

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.570 
plus these third 20 so 4 plus 4 is 8 8
plus<00:04:47.190> 3<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.669> 11<00:04:47.789> 11<00:04:48.720> Plus<00:04:49.020> 3<00:04:49.199> is<00:04:49.440> 40<00:04:49.830> 40<00:04:50.039> plus<00:04:50.370> 2

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
plus 3 is 11 11 Plus 3 is 40 40 plus 2

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.839 
plus 3 is 11 11 Plus 3 is 40 40 plus 2
that<00:04:50.729> carrot<00:04:51.150> over<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.599> 60<00:04:52.139> if<00:04:52.440> we<00:04:53.010> divide<00:04:53.340> 16

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
that carrot over is 60 if we divide 16

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.920 
that carrot over is 60 if we divide 16
by<00:04:53.880> 10<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.630> get<00:04:54.900> upon<00:04:55.470> 6<00:04:55.770> square<00:04:56.310> isn't<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.270> so

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
by 10 you get upon 6 square isn't it so

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.339 
by 10 you get upon 6 square isn't it so
that<00:04:58.620> means<00:04:58.919> third<00:04:59.370> option<00:04:59.699> is<00:05:00.150> your<00:05:00.630> answer

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
that means third option is your answer

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.930 
that means third option is your answer
you<00:05:01.530> try<00:05:01.770> these<00:05:01.830> options<00:05:02.220> they<00:05:02.580> won't<00:05:02.789> give

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
you try these options they won't give

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.700 
you try these options they won't give
you<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> answer<00:05:03.539> to<00:05:03.720> be<00:05:03.840> safe<00:05:04.169> right<00:05:04.440> they

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
you the answer to be safe right they

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.640 
you the answer to be safe right they
will<00:05:05.190> give<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.520> 280<00:05:06.050> both<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.199> them<00:05:07.349> will<00:05:07.500> give

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
will give you 280 both of them will give

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.649 
will give you 280 both of them will give
you<00:05:07.770> 280<00:05:08.340> which<00:05:08.520> will<00:05:08.789> not<00:05:09.000> be<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.539> answer

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
you 280 which will not be the answer

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:10.570 
you 280 which will not be the answer
which<00:05:10.289> is

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
which is

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.360 
which is
above<00:05:11.000> it's<00:05:11.180> wet<00:05:11.509> right<00:05:12.169> so<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.800> means<00:05:12.979> that

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
above it's wet right so that means that

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.839 
above it's wet right so that means that
I<00:05:13.610> got<00:05:14.000> my<00:05:14.210> answer<00:05:14.599> as<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.930> third<00:05:15.169> option<00:05:15.849> so

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
I got my answer as the third option so

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.379 
I got my answer as the third option so
you<00:05:16.879> can<00:05:17.030> very<00:05:17.389> well<00:05:17.479> see<00:05:17.629> how<00:05:18.669> what<00:05:19.669> logic<00:05:20.060> is

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
you can very well see how what logic is

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.200 
you can very well see how what logic is
being<00:05:20.960> used<00:05:21.229> in<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.680> question<00:05:22.250> are<00:05:22.759> you<00:05:22.939> if

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
being used in this question are you if

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.149 
being used in this question are you if
you<00:05:23.419> start<00:05:23.750> using<00:05:23.930> algebra<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:24.710> will<00:05:24.830> end<00:05:25.039> up

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
you start using algebra you will end up

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.029 
you start using algebra you will end up
into<00:05:25.520> complex<00:05:25.909> equation<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.629> that's<00:05:26.810> why<00:05:27.110> dad

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
into complex equation and that's why dad

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.950 
into complex equation and that's why dad
is<00:05:28.310> found<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.789> be<00:05:28.909> difficult<00:05:29.090> but<00:05:29.449> it's<00:05:29.599> not

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
is found to be difficult but it's not

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.050 
is found to be difficult but it's not
difficult<00:05:30.319> you<00:05:30.620> have<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:31.129> follow<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.669> logical

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
difficult you have to follow the logical

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.969 
difficult you have to follow the logical
approach<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.750> even<00:05:33.229> if<00:05:33.319> you're<00:05:33.469> using<00:05:33.710> the

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
approach and even if you're using the

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.830 
approach and even if you're using the
options<00:05:34.430> even<00:05:34.580> before<00:05:34.819> it<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.180> trying<00:05:35.509> to<00:05:35.659> use

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
options even before it is trying to use

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.920 
options even before it is trying to use
the<00:05:36.020> options<00:05:36.439> you<00:05:36.620> should<00:05:36.879> list<00:05:37.879> it<00:05:38.090> down<00:05:38.449> so

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
the options you should list it down so

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.659 
the options you should list it down so
that<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.319> know<00:05:39.409> using<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:39.979> options<00:05:40.370> become

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
that you know using the options become

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.240 
that you know using the options become
more<00:05:40.909> efficient<00:05:41.599> right<00:05:41.780> so<00:05:42.469> I<00:05:42.860> hope<00:05:43.129> you

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
more efficient right so I hope you

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.459 
more efficient right so I hope you
understood<00:05:43.699> this<00:05:43.909> and<00:05:44.210> don't<00:05:44.780> forget<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.259> send
