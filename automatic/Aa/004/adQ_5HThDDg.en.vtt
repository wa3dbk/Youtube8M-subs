the ones they actually use have a map in
the<00:02:08.160> social<00:02:08.489> space<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.880> that's<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:09.270> cool

you can do it but that highly advise
against<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> isn't<00:02:12.270> hugely

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
against it because it isn't hugely

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.440 
against it because it isn't hugely
hugely<00:02:13.680> problematic<00:02:14.129> just<00:02:14.520> cuz<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:14.910> just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
hugely problematic just cuz it's just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.089 
hugely problematic just cuz it's just
pretty<00:02:15.629> much<00:02:15.780> luck<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> face<00:02:16.860> on

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
pretty much luck they get the face on

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.949 
pretty much luck they get the face on
but<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:18.000> I'll<00:02:18.180> show<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> two<00:02:18.690> person

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
but here I'll show you in a two person

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.390 
but here I'll show you in a two person
though<00:02:19.080> you're<00:02:19.319> gonna<00:02:19.410> wash<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.010> guy<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
though you're gonna wash the guy in the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.470 
though you're gonna wash the guy in the
piece<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.580> metal<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> crouch<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
piece of metal he's going to crouch and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
piece of metal he's going to crouch and
stand<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> let<00:02:22.050> him<00:02:22.349> know<00:02:22.379> he's<00:02:22.739> going<00:02:22.950> once

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
stand to let him know he's going once

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.100 
stand to let him know he's going once
you<00:02:23.700> stands<00:02:23.879> back<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.120> wait<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> second<00:02:24.989> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
you stands back up wait a second and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.570 
you stands back up wait a second and
then<00:02:25.200> jumps<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> other<00:02:26.040> guy<00:02:26.220> jumps

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then jumps and then the other guy jumps

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.699 
then jumps and then the other guy jumps
off<00:02:26.760> them<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.270> gets<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.080> top<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.500> I'm<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
off them and gets up top so I'm going to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.600 
off them and gets up top so I'm going to
be<00:02:28.800> showing<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> few<00:02:29.520> different

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
be showing that in a few different

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.059 
be showing that in a few different
angles<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> guys<00:02:31.020> could<00:02:31.260> concept<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
angles so you guys could concept of it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
angles so you guys could concept of it
down<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.360> sure<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:34.020> your<00:02:34.050> Juliet

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
down but make sure you have your Juliet

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.260 
down but make sure you have your Juliet
match<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> look<00:02:35.520> around<00:02:35.640> your<00:02:35.849> subclass

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
match just to look around your subclass

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.790 
match just to look around your subclass
crank<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.020> high<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
crank it up as high as you can so it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.259 
crank it up as high as you can so it
makes<00:02:37.980> difference<00:02:38.430> between<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:38.970> making<00:02:39.209> you

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
makes difference between not making you

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.210 
makes difference between not making you
jump<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.660> actually<00:02:40.230> making<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.530> job<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:41.040> make

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
jump and actually making a job to make

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
jump and actually making a job to make
all<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> difference<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.660> over<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.170> can

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
all the difference so over here you can

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.199 
all the difference so over here you can
get<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.709> top<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.010> melting<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:44.580> ways<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.030> now

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
get on top is melting two ways so now

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.420 
get on top is melting two ways so now
watch<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.629> crouch<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.200> stand<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.190> let<00:02:47.280> my

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
watch I crouch and stand to let my

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.770 
watch I crouch and stand to let my
friend<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:47.849> going<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.330> then<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.510> begin

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
friend know I'm going and then I begin

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.020 
friend know I'm going and then I begin
to<00:02:48.959> run<00:02:49.170> jump<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.650> second<00:02:50.040> later<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.519> then

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
to run jump a second later and then

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.340 
to run jump a second later and then
you'll<00:02:51.210> notice<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> very<00:02:51.810> top<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> screen

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
you'll notice the very top of the screen

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.140 
you'll notice the very top of the screen

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
run he's gonna jump jump forward I'm

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.759

gonna jump off his head and there you go

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.070 
gonna jump off his head and there you go
that's<00:03:15.010> pretty<00:03:15.280> much<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.459> now<00:03:15.879> here<00:03:16.780> there's

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
that's pretty much it now here there's

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.300 
that's pretty much it now here there's
still<00:03:17.290> few<00:03:17.500> other<00:03:17.650> complications<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.190> can

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
still few other complications that can

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.650 
still few other complications that can
occur<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.730> now<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.180> pretty<00:03:19.420> much<00:03:19.540> do

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
occur but now you just pretty much do

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.420 
occur but now you just pretty much do
the<00:03:19.690> hardest<00:03:20.110> part<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.410> my<00:03:20.500> opinion<00:03:20.739> well<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the hardest part in my opinion well the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.309 
the hardest part in my opinion well the
second<00:03:21.790> about<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.569> hardest<00:03:22.840> part<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.019> next

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
second about the hardest part the next

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.869 
second about the hardest part the next
hardest<00:03:23.620> part<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:23.920> jumping<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.400> top<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.760> these

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
hardest part is jumping on top in these

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.940 
hardest part is jumping on top in these
so<00:03:25.540> your<00:03:25.690> first<00:03:25.930> jumbo<00:03:26.260> top<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> little<00:03:26.650> blue

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so your first jumbo top is a little blue

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.530 
so your first jumbo top is a little blue
Oh<00:03:26.980> hump<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.549> then<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:28.060> tricky<00:03:28.329> part

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
Oh hump and then this the tricky part

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.150 
Oh hump and then this the tricky part
jump<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.959> dropping<00:03:29.349> onto<00:03:29.470> these<00:03:29.650> pipes<00:03:29.920> so<00:03:30.069> if

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
jump and dropping onto these pipes so if

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.100 
jump and dropping onto these pipes so if
you<00:03:30.400> go<00:03:30.640> too<00:03:30.700> much<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> left<00:03:31.450> you're<00:03:32.019> gonna

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
you go too much the left you're gonna

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.390 
you go too much the left you're gonna
hit<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.349> blue<00:03:32.620> slope<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.010> you're<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.129> fall

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
hit that blue slope and you're a fall

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.559 
hit that blue slope and you're a fall
and<00:03:33.519> you're<00:03:33.640> going<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.790> die<00:03:33.940> yet<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.269> redo<00:03:34.540> it

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
and you're going to die yet to redo it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.199 
and you're going to die yet to redo it
all<00:03:34.810> over<00:03:35.049> again<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.310> also<00:03:36.519> when<00:03:36.819> you<00:03:36.910> drop

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
all over again and also when you drop

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.210 
all over again and also when you drop
make<00:03:37.840> sure<00:03:37.870> not<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.319> too<00:03:38.500> far<00:03:38.530> right<00:03:38.920> she'll

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
make sure not to go too far right she'll

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.530 
make sure not to go too far right she'll
also<00:03:39.400> bounced<00:03:39.670> off<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:39.879> pipe<00:03:40.150> right<00:03:40.510> there

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
also bounced off the pipe right there

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.300 
also bounced off the pipe right there
you<00:03:40.810> almost<00:03:40.930> saw<00:03:41.140> me<00:03:41.290> hit<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:41.470> but<00:03:41.950> as<00:03:42.160> you're

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
you almost saw me hit it but as you're

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.800 
you almost saw me hit it but as you're
running<00:03:42.489> towards<00:03:42.940> these<00:03:43.090> little<00:03:43.329> blue<00:03:43.540> like

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
running towards these little blue like

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.910 
running towards these little blue like
things<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.230> jump<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.530> these<00:03:44.590> little<00:03:44.829> blue

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
things to jump on these little blue

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.860 
things to jump on these little blue
pillars<00:03:45.250> make<00:03:45.549> sure<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.150> don't<00:03:46.480> run

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
pillars make sure that you don't run

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.210 
pillars make sure that you don't run
into<00:03:47.109> them<00:03:47.230> full<00:03:47.440> tilt<00:03:47.709> because<00:03:47.829> you<00:03:48.010> will

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
into them full tilt because you will

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970 
into them full tilt because you will
work<00:03:48.579> Shay<00:03:48.849> off<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.390> also<00:03:49.540> fall<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.620> here

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
work Shay off and you also fall now here

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.289 
work Shay off and you also fall now here
is<00:03:51.129> tricky<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.609> this<00:03:51.730> piece<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.030> metal<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
is tricky see this piece of metal the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.550 
is tricky see this piece of metal the
first<00:03:52.510> piece<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.750> metal<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.170> see<00:03:53.470> that

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
first piece of metal that you see that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.069 
first piece of metal that you see that
hangs<00:03:53.769> out<00:03:54.010> its<00:03:54.129> closest<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.459> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
hangs out its closest to you

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.509 
hangs out its closest to you
overestimate<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.109> 5<00:03:56.379> out<00:03:56.590> two<00:03:56.859> feet<00:03:57.190> because

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
overestimate a 5 out two feet because

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.979 
overestimate a 5 out two feet because
the<00:03:57.549> actual<00:03:57.940> metal<00:03:58.150> thing<00:03:58.359> is<00:03:58.510> fake<00:03:58.720> as<00:03:58.900> you

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
the actual metal thing is fake as you

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.479 
the actual metal thing is fake as you
can<00:03:59.079> see<00:03:59.230> them<00:03:59.319> inside<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.859> what<00:04:00.400> I'm

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
can see them inside of it what I'm

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.069 
can see them inside of it what I'm
accion<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.239> pipe<00:04:01.480> that's<00:04:01.660> underneath<00:04:01.870> me

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
accion is this pipe that's underneath me

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.479 
accion is this pipe that's underneath me
right<00:04:02.410> here<00:04:02.620> as<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:02.859> can<00:04:02.919> see<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.250> little

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
right here as you can see this little

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.949 
right here as you can see this little
big<00:04:03.760> pike<00:04:04.030> right<00:04:04.209> here<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.480> small<00:04:04.720> pipes

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
big pike right here the small pipes

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.720 
big pike right here the small pipes
after<00:04:05.109> you<00:04:05.260> think<00:04:05.410> as<00:04:05.530> well<00:04:05.680> but<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:06.669> can

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
after you think as well but as you can

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.830 
after you think as well but as you can
see<00:04:06.880> now<00:04:07.090> you're<00:04:07.239> pretty<00:04:07.389> much<00:04:07.510> pulling

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
see now you're pretty much pulling

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.150 
see now you're pretty much pulling
outside<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.109> map<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.470> pretty<00:04:08.680> hard<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:08.950> fuck

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
outside the map it's pretty hard to fuck

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.220 
outside the map it's pretty hard to fuck
up<00:04:09.310> from<00:04:09.489> here<00:04:09.609> especially<00:04:09.880> because<00:04:10.419> once<00:04:11.139> you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
up from here especially because once you

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.539 
up from here especially because once you
get<00:04:11.319> over<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.560> another<00:04:11.799> big<00:04:12.069> area<00:04:12.099> you're

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
get over to this another big area you're

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.640 
get over to this another big area you're
pretty<00:04:12.790> much<00:04:12.819> safe<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.480> sound<00:04:13.690> as<00:04:13.959> soon<00:04:14.620> as

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
pretty much safe and sound as soon as

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.979 
pretty much safe and sound as soon as
you're<00:04:14.859> on<00:04:14.889> that<00:04:15.250> real<00:04:15.669> ground<00:04:15.970> you're<00:04:16.720> pretty

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you're on that real ground you're pretty

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.659 
you're on that real ground you're pretty
much<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.470> can<00:04:17.620> actually<00:04:17.739> spawn<00:04:18.190> back<00:04:18.459> outside

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
much you can actually spawn back outside

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.479 
much you can actually spawn back outside
here<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.389> die<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.530> make<00:04:20.769> your<00:04:20.919> way<00:04:21.010> back<00:04:21.039> to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
here if you die so make your way back to

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.980 
here if you die so make your way back to
the<00:04:21.579> building<00:04:21.970> after<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.539> kind<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.840> go<00:04:22.960> out

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
the building after you kind of go out

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.839 
the building after you kind of go out
there<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.260> explore<00:04:23.500> yourself<00:04:23.919> but<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.729> can

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
there and explore yourself but you can

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.950 
there and explore yourself but you can
make<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.090> way<00:04:25.150> back<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.660> now<00:04:25.780> you're

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
make your way back and now you're

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.629 
make your way back and now you're
actually<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.289> this<00:04:26.770> whole<00:04:27.010> ground<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.490> once

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
actually on this whole ground and once

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.640 
actually on this whole ground and once
you're<00:04:27.789> over<00:04:27.820> here<00:04:28.090> you're<00:04:28.360> more<00:04:28.539> likely<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
you're over here you're more likely to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.620 
you're over here you're more likely to
spawn<00:04:29.950> actually<00:04:30.340> outside<00:04:30.669> map<00:04:30.940> if<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.300> are<00:04:31.479> to

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
spawn actually outside map if you are to

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.659 
spawn actually outside map if you are to
die<00:04:31.780> now<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.260> there's<00:04:32.919> only<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:33.400> death

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
die now so there's only one death

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.830 
die now so there's only one death
barrier<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.270> be<00:04:34.360> concerned<00:04:34.630> about

other than one a tree but will show you

that at the end of the video but as you

can see you can actually come inside the
seat<00:04:41.800> room<00:04:41.979> back<00:04:42.130> here<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.700> was

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
seat room back here and this was

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.710 
seat room back here and this was
actually<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.270> very<00:04:43.450> first<00:04:43.570> day<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:45.720> the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
actually the very first day that the the

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.270 
actually the very first day that the the
dlc<00:04:47.289> came<00:04:47.440> out<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.710> we<00:04:47.860> haven't<00:04:48.039> even<00:04:48.099> done<00:04:48.220> a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
dlc came out like we haven't even done a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.650 
dlc came out like we haven't even done a
single<00:04:48.460> story<00:04:48.849> mission<00:04:49.120> at<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.330> point<00:04:49.539> when

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
single story mission at this point when

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.930 
single story mission at this point when
we<00:04:49.690> were<00:04:49.840> recording<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.789> we<00:04:51.789> actually

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
we were recording this and we actually

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.520 
we were recording this and we actually
saw<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.449> hallway<00:04:52.870> which<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.229> guys<00:04:53.320> who

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
saw this hallway which of you guys who

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.020 
saw this hallway which of you guys who
can<00:04:53.650> recognize<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:54.250> where<00:04:54.520> exert<00:04:54.849> is

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
can recognize this where exert is

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.219 
can recognize this where exert is
actually<00:04:55.360> on<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.539> weekend<00:04:55.900> he<00:04:56.020> was<00:04:56.110> actually

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
actually on the weekend he was actually

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.020 
actually on the weekend he was actually
located<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:56.949> we<00:04:57.039> were<00:04:57.130> wondering<00:04:57.460> what<00:04:57.639> the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
located here we were wondering what the

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.270 
located here we were wondering what the
purpose<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:58.990> room<00:04:59.229> was<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.010> they<00:05:00.130> can

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
purpose of that room was and they can

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.800 
purpose of that room was and they can
actually<00:05:00.400> know<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.669> few<00:05:00.820> days<00:05:00.970> later<00:05:01.300> exert

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
actually know a few days later exert

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.330 
actually know a few days later exert
opens<00:05:02.139> up<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:02.440> there<00:05:02.590> using<00:05:02.860> there<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.160> guess

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
opens up in there using there so I guess

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.440 
opens up in there using there so I guess
that's<00:05:03.520> what<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.699> lot<00:05:03.820> more<00:05:04.000> we<00:05:04.150> thought<00:05:04.330> was

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
that's what a lot more we thought was

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.790 
that's what a lot more we thought was
just<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.780> fail<00:05:04.960> there<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.289> can<00:05:05.380> seem<00:05:05.560> kind<00:05:05.770> of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
just a fail there you can seem kind of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.250 
just a fail there you can seem kind of
pointless<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.219> have<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.370> denon<00:05:06.700> hallway<00:05:07.150> but<00:05:08.140> um

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
pointless to have a denon hallway but um

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.870 
pointless to have a denon hallway but um
yeah<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.250> great<00:05:10.370> thing<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.580> can<00:05:10.670> do<00:05:10.760> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
yeah it's great thing you can do the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.000 
yeah it's great thing you can do the
skillets<00:05:11.270> go<00:05:11.450> solo<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:12.410> good<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.860> be<00:05:12.980> 0

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
skillets go solo and like good to be 0

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.710 
skillets go solo and like good to be 0
but<00:05:13.250> for<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.880> rest<00:05:14.030> of<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.210> reef<00:05:14.390> it<00:05:14.510> doesn't

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
but for the rest of the reef it doesn't

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.660 
but for the rest of the reef it doesn't
look<00:05:14.780> like<00:05:14.840> it's<00:05:15.080> very<00:05:15.260> coachable<00:05:15.670> that's

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
look like it's very coachable that's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.370 
look like it's very coachable that's
pretty<00:05:17.090> much<00:05:17.270> what<00:05:17.600> we've<00:05:17.750> seen<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:17.990> far<00:05:18.140> but

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
pretty much what we've seen so far but

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.510 
pretty much what we've seen so far but
now<00:05:18.500> which<00:05:18.740> we're<00:05:18.980> going<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:19.160> show<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.340> again

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
now which we're going to show you again

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.150 
now which we're going to show you again
you<00:05:19.760> can<00:05:19.880> actually<00:05:20.240> get<00:05:20.360> back<00:05:20.660> out<00:05:21.590> over<00:05:22.010> here

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
you can actually get back out over here

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.770 
you can actually get back out over here
we<00:05:22.340> tried<00:05:22.640> getting<00:05:22.910> on<00:05:23.000> top<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.390> a<00:05:23.450> different

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
we tried getting on top of a different

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.630 
we tried getting on top of a different
roof<00:05:23.930> at<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.080> very<00:05:24.290> far<00:05:24.530> end<00:05:24.740> off<00:05:24.950> so<00:05:25.430> where<00:05:25.610> I

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
roof at the very far end off so where I

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.580 
roof at the very far end off so where I
am<00:05:25.790> at<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.120> end<00:05:26.360> right<00:05:26.480> now<00:05:26.540> but<00:05:27.290> we<00:05:27.380> think

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
am at this end right now but we think

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.960 
am at this end right now but we think
it's<00:05:27.770> buried<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.130> guys<00:05:28.280> can<00:05:28.460> try<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:28.730> might

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
it's buried you guys can try you might

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.100 
it's buried you guys can try you might
be<00:05:29.060> able<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.210> go<00:05:29.300> into<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.510> back<00:05:29.720> side<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
be able to go into the back side of the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.990 
be able to go into the back side of the
reef<00:05:30.260> we<00:05:30.410> think<00:05:30.620> it's<00:05:30.740> very<00:05:30.920> pretty<00:05:31.550> sure<00:05:31.790> but

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
reef we think it's very pretty sure but

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.850 
reef we think it's very pretty sure but
when<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.360> can<00:05:32.600> give<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.810> shot<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.200> feel<00:05:33.650> free

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
when you can give a shot and feel free

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.280 
when you can give a shot and feel free
to<00:05:33.950> explore<00:05:34.130> yourself<00:05:34.360> but<00:05:35.360> once<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.990> run<00:05:36.230> out

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
to explore yourself but once you run out

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.830 
to explore yourself but once you run out
here<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:36.770> can<00:05:36.920> actually<00:05:37.100> go<00:05:38.000> far<00:05:38.300> enough<00:05:38.390> past

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
here you can actually go far enough past

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.880 
here you can actually go far enough past
a<00:05:39.080> death<00:05:39.230> bear<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.470> can<00:05:39.650> actually<00:05:39.740> just

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
a death bear you can actually just

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.850 
a death bear you can actually just
simply<00:05:40.370> drop<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:41.690> don't<00:05:41.930> even<00:05:42.110> like<00:05:42.470> just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
simply drop and you don't even like just

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.010 
simply drop and you don't even like just
smack<00:05:43.220> your<00:05:43.460> head<00:05:43.520> off<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.970> pole<00:05:44.570> basically

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
smack your head off that pole basically

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.300 
smack your head off that pole basically
and<00:05:45.140> you're<00:05:45.260> more<00:05:45.410> than<00:05:45.530> likely<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:46.040> spawn

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
and you're more than likely to spawn

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.460 
and you're more than likely to spawn
there<00:05:46.580> if<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.210> don't<00:05:47.330> spawn<00:05:47.690> down<00:05:47.960> lower<00:05:48.230> pipe

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
there if you don't spawn down lower pipe

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.140 
there if you don't spawn down lower pipe
after<00:05:48.800> hitting<00:05:48.980> it<00:05:49.190> just<00:05:49.670> keep<00:05:49.880> hitting<00:05:50.000> it

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
after hitting it just keep hitting it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.340 
after hitting it just keep hitting it
more<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.480> you'll<00:05:50.570> eventually<00:05:50.690> spot<00:05:51.020> but<00:05:51.200> as

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
more and you'll eventually spot but as

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.930 
more and you'll eventually spot but as
you<00:05:51.500> see<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.710> spawn<00:05:52.100> instantly<00:05:52.490> down<00:05:52.610> here<00:05:52.790> once

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
you see I spawn instantly down here once

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.370 
you see I spawn instantly down here once
