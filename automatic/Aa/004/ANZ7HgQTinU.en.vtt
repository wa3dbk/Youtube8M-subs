they could easily tap the some holes on
this<00:02:56.920> side<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.760> understand<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.750> they

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
this side but I understand that they

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.420 
this side but I understand that they
probably<00:02:59.020> want<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.320> maintain<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.830> beautiful

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
the opening of this knife when I when I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
the opening of this knife when I when I
first<00:03:11.980> got<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.400> knife<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.640> extremely<00:03:13.510> hard

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
first got this knife is extremely hard

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.970 
first got this knife is extremely hard
to<00:03:13.750> open<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:14.170> for<00:03:14.440> some<00:03:14.530> reason<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.830> know

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
to open because for some reason you know

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.470 
to open because for some reason you know
I<00:03:15.010> don't<00:03:15.160> know<00:03:15.340> why<00:03:15.520> but<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.210> know<00:03:16.300> do<00:03:16.390> you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
I don't know why but the you know do you

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.820 
I don't know why but the you know do you
think<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.690> ball<00:03:16.900> bearing<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.350> lock<00:03:17.530> would<00:03:17.680> be

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
think a ball bearing the lock would be

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.830 
think a ball bearing the lock would be
easy<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.790> thing<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.030> very<00:03:19.180> stiff<00:03:19.450> but

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
easy but this thing was very stiff but

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.480 
easy but this thing was very stiff but
now<00:03:20.020> after<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.380> little<00:03:20.650> bit<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.040> playing<00:03:21.310> with

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
now after a little bit of playing with

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.340 
now after a little bit of playing with
it<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.910> actually<00:03:22.030> opens<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.840> closes<00:03:23.020> very

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
it it actually opens and closes very

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.410 
it it actually opens and closes very
very<00:03:23.530> smoothly<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.820> let<00:03:24.970> me<00:03:25.030> give<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.210> a<00:03:25.240> nice

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
very smoothly and let me give you a nice

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.940 
very smoothly and let me give you a nice
shot<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.750> how<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.080> ball<00:03:26.230> bearing<00:03:26.560> lock<00:03:26.710> works

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
shot of how that ball bearing lock works

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.940 
shot of how that ball bearing lock works
you<00:03:27.460> know<00:03:27.520> just<00:03:27.820> goes<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:29.860> it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
you know just goes in and then when it

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.410 
you know just goes in and then when it
comes<00:03:30.280> up<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.640> notch<00:03:30.850> when<00:03:31.180> it's<00:03:31.270> fully

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
comes up to the notch when it's fully

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.960 
comes up to the notch when it's fully
open<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.650> snaps<00:03:32.860> right<00:03:32.980> in<00:03:33.220> holds<00:03:33.880> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
open it just snaps right in holds it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.260 
open it just snaps right in holds it
open<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:34.840> very<00:03:34.960> good<00:03:35.200> design<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.270> that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
open so it's very good design and that
