 November and Saturday it is Saturday 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.409
 we think it is very important to you 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 to tell how this short film 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 has come 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.979
 because gray how we have each other 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.979
 actually met 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.810
 there would be a car we just go here 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.689
 down from this slope above 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.189
 yes the bullshit thought it went from that 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.869
 slope down and we are 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.000
 halfway and suddenly the roller shutter goes 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.399
 close behind us at that time 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.490
 g-snake always kept close contact and 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.280
 then a telephone or ringing ringing 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.340
 tring tring tring tring just call it 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.340

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.750
 little problem what is the problem 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.599

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.549

 would you naturally help me and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.340
 that I think 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.440
 It 's the biggest problem when 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.110
 everyone has fantasy and make a movie 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.340
 can come up with a story and of course 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.290
 is that you absolutely have to 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 write down type blah blah actor b 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.049
 start but the big problem is still 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.549
 often equipment 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.340
 what is your problem he is my 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.470
 problem 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.049
 how i like man but i have one 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.670
 very big idea in my head and I like that 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.410
 finally come and write it down 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.180
 other people can see it as well 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.350
 I say so I think a lot of viewers 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.049
 who see this video 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.930
 Imagine you are a young filmmaker yourself 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.220
 then you have problems anyway and I am 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.049
 very curious what is your problem 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.139
 when making a short movie let it 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.389
 behind via a tweet at the film factory 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.920
 because and the 20 back can be fun 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.319
 start conversation 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.450
 gray what the question to me yes i mean 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.370
 what is your own happiness duties at the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.709
 a lot i am a kind of distributor 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.680
 what is our film about needed but ours 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.980
 movie is about two boys who 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.959
 both have a separate home situation 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 in which they would rather not go 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.900
 stay alive and get out of that 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.079
 They must escape from life situations 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.459
 what entrepreneurship and what exactly is what 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.739
 We actually have a little secret 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.450
 but that something exciting is going on 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.400
 we happen to be one thing that is certain 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.829
 that the action is and that I am also in this 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.110
 lots of it 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.329
 I also look at the honor of the rich 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.129
 wils idea I have quite a big one 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.310
 story in my head and this is 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.840
 actually the first ten minutes of van 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.900
 the story that I have in my mind yes 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.150
 kind of pilot that we will ever come here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.859
 could go really far and everything 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.810
 but this is there but the causes are running 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.689
 could really film the result 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.069
 that would be my legs and I 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.900
