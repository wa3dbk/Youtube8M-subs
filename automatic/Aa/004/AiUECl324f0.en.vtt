 how to have special weapons 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.190
 zombies in the multiplayer before 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.990
 zombies there are etc etc and in the video 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 He also commented that there were other weapons 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 zombie specials that could be used 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.260
 in the game in English but not in the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 Spanish and what good tells us that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.009
 I would investigate to find a way 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 to be able to have it and I have found it like that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.239
 if you want me to upload it only 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 ask me today and in a couple of days or so 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 it weighs us down and from there to grate more 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.840
 special to give you an idea 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.879
 as for example the scavenger we have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 also the red bull market 4 if it's a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.020
 weapon that does not exist but this network a bar 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 4 we have the one for the yzr we have then 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 different weapons than in the video that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 I went up the other day to bayern or good 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.620
 It depends when you are watching this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.300
 they left not so good without further delay 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 let's start doing the tutorial 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.570
 tell you how good I only started black 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.440
 ops 1 of pc so those that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.120
 have console and then do not want to train 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.280
 in console I guess you have to have 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.710
 the hacked console or something in agreement 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.470
 tell you that this is not hack okay it is not 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.470
 a check is an official mod of the game in 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.060
 the game because it lets you put a lot and then 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.530
 there was a person who created this mount 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
 have special weapons so that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
 what do you think is hack is not not hack is 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310
 just a mod so nothing we're going to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.700
 start I'll leave a link in the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.860
 description of agreement or link of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.390
 mediafire here you have it in the good 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.899
 then you have to download the file 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.430
 that in this case is mod weapons here what 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.610
 You see, I'm going to put the captcha so that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.930
 see how much it occupies 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 the file occupies 423 92 megs are 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 it fit quite enough truth 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.440
 but good the truth is that it's worth 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.940
 quite worth it I will leave you the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.890
 description there you will have it in agreement 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.950
 Once you download it, it will come out 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 it will come out here here it's worth it you see it a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 second here is worth a winrar in which 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.280
 there is a folder that puts mod weapons 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 you then extract it for example 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 to the desk where you want because this 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.060
 now we will have to change it to another 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.370
 folder here we have it worth weapons mod 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 we have two folders you do not have to put and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.959
 wd and four files in the wd and mp 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.120
 awesome of classes version 3.1 of agreement 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.950
 that will be a few files of the mod that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.239
 we will have to do now according 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 I explain what we will have to do 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.700
 will go to the steam files of the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.860
 game for that we will have to open a 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.650
 new direction in the good to have 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.410
 we have to go to my pc to my team 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 We will go to local disk and it depends if you have 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.340
 the 64-bit or 32-bit operating system 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.640
 you will have to give him or her files 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.640
 program or files of the x86 program 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.340
 the 64-bit operating system that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.900
 you have to give x86 if you have 32 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.819
 normal and current program files 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.290
 and if not then you look for the meta folder that 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.230
 I will tell you now it will be in one of 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.510
 these two folders we open files of 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.459
 program my case is x86 we are going to the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.610
 steam folder here under steam 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.260
 inside steam we will go to steam apps and 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.700
 inside this and maps to common we 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.830
 will all videogames 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.590
 we have in steam bought and that therefore 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.450
 we can play around and in which 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.700
 we will have the black ops 1 rocket 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.430
 here we see it we open it and it will come out 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.680
 well this agree once we have what 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.780
 that all this is what 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.330
 we have to do it will go to what I'm going to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.160
 put a team and you will see it go to main of 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.220
 agreement you go the folder that puts in main 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.980
 the drift of the whole and here you will see all 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.050
 the files and w then worth what 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.450
 we will have to do will be to enter the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.300
 yw files that we had downloaded 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.519
 that we have here the folder and wd and the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.010
 we will replace accordingly you see that with 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.090
 which concretely are 29 on 30 to 31 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.760
 and the 30 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.390
 down here we have them 29 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.239
 where they are where they are here 29 30 31 and 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.879
 32 what you have to do is easy 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.920
 catch them the drag is here next and 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.480
 you give to replace the files in the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.459
 destiny and I in this case I will not 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.440
 because I have replaced them here 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.289
 so I will not do it once you have done 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.900
 this will pull backwards back here 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.880
 also and you will have to create if not 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.500

 This will open on the web about classes 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.970
 open if we open the web about 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.800
 classes problem gives a screenshot I hope 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.480
 second student now surely not 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.190
 you will be seeing nothing in agreement 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.900
 I'm going to set it up so you can see it 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.900
 second window mode 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.340
 here you see it again we have loaded 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.980
 the mod as you see above on the right we 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.130
 It gets very loaded from this mod 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.710
 of classes version 3.1 and once we have 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.750
 this very easy we do not get in and play 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.900
 as always they do not work in exploring 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.370
 servers does not work does not work 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.140
 counterparty or anything what you have to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.430
 to do so will be to play as a private game 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.350
 or in instruction 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.150
 once you play this kind of 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.280
 good more to the instruction to departure 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.169
 you will see that when starting the game 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.169
 will let you choose between 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.999
 will let you choose between nine classes 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.469
 different I think there are eight I do not 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.479
 agreement exactly of which therefore 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.639
 there are four that are zombie weapons 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.939
 now you will see it equally today I repeat if 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.379
 you have not seen it in the if you do not know 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.669
 how are they I'll leave the video in the 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.039
 description you see that it puts us very much 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.449
 there are many options on the menu we 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:53.550
 you give the keyboard time because 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.009
 example here to 1 and we get a wonder 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.960
 this has not been all people I hope that you 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.639
 have flown this has been the tutorial of 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.310
 how to have the special weapons of 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.379
 zombies in multiplayer and I repeat there 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.060
 another there is another mode of agreement found 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:08.189
 another way in which there are more weapons 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.069
 specials like the scavenger arrived wrong 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:13.319
 class and dual guns there's a lot of 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.089
 a lot of weapons so if you want 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:16.349
 that only give rise to like a 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.729
 this video and ask me with the 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.349
 comments and / or without any kind of 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.689
 problem because I will bring it to you in a video 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:23.219
 different but my part nothing else I hope 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:25.460
 assets from both sides and see you this 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.460
 video
