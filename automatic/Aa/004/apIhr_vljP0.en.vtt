00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.770
 no no 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.860
 and games days days 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 it's very good has simply been 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 spectacular having an encounter with 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.239
 daniel bryan alberto has been a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.830
 authentic pleasure and pride for a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.879
 amateur wrestling as a 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.699
 server and hopefully even though last year 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.260
 also a superstar even more 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.720
 legendary that daniel bryan that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 we could business in discussing it not 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.280
 because we go big show at the end is a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 fighter who has many years in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 the company and what good is part 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 main of the water mountain of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 monday night word forgiveness or that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.920
 we are talking about an authentic 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.410
 legend daniel bryan ww 216 tell us 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 news very happy with the game 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.080
 Alberto devotes many hours to 2k 15 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.899
 and what has been shown in this 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 production is that I knew perfectly 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.929
 that was what this game needed and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 it was precisely that there was no more 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.070
 cons you'll remember that when you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.670
 they punched you 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.830
 and you could say to read some forgiveness and 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.870
 I could catch him and hit him back 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.300
 Well, that has been limited now 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.270
 same to a one bar tank that is 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.250
 below the energy in which if you use 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.540
 one counter hit that does not end and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.520
 It takes time to fill them in 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.470
 through salt abuse with which 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.119
 Of course Alberto will not use the contra 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 for all the attacks that are you 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.170
 making the rival that was what was happening 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.000
 in the last editions ww 2 here like this 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.100
 that now you will have to assess if 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.050
 it's really worth doing that that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.580
 against a yak for telling you something or 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.560
 against a catch that does not go to any 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.380
 part will always have to have one for 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.780
 hold the ultimate and be able to prevent 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
 make you a tostÃ³n or anything else 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.340
 thompson like the one we hope to see 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.230
 shortly before brock lesnar that goes 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.209
 to be impressive death 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.130
 the game feels like a little more than 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.140
 strategy in combat that since 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.140
 measure your new games a lot and of course 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.030
 Of course Alberto de Ww de 2k offers 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.760
 other things other than that would be more 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.799
 but the question is what 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.840
 if you value vice fight and enjoy vice 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.489
 of the games of this title because it is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.439
 very good news the fact that it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.480
 have put the batteries in that aspect 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.060
 the movements of his mission every month 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.920
 before they have changed in the end is one thing 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.209
 a little difficult to explain ballet the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 movement of his mission now is a 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.269
 sphere in which a player controls a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.950
 arrow and the other control to another vale 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.810
 depending on the fatigue and the damage that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.760
 we have at that moment of 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.879
 Combat submission because it consists of 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 catch that arrow inside the circle 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.620
 ok and it's a game of as well as of 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.849
 very funny skill and I think that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.159
 it's better than the model we had 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.069
 right now that only consisted in giving 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.709
 knocks to the button to the case things that you 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.590
 more than 100 fighters are interested 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.329
 they will not abuse the dlcs so much 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.269
 as it happened with w from 12 to 15 and 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.400
 we hope we have showcase i sat 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.079
 it's only worth we have been promised that inside 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.579
 of little there will be good news in 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.400
 Regarding the fighters that will be offered 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.510
 the full list of the 120 would swear that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.700
 they were 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.110
 and they will give information about the showcase of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.970
 moment, all we know is that very 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.680
 probably one of the showcases these 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.290
 in these moments of history 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.970
 narrated within the video game itself in 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.470
 a historic moment of wrestling 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.980
 surely one of them is 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.110
 starring steve austin stonewall 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.200
 reading a preview of the quote 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.209
 introduction and subtract to see if 2k has 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 prepared some more story I would 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.129
 I would love to see the extension of Daniel 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.769
 bryan westall was coming 30 you know in the 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.569
 fight against triple h all the roll that 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.519
 there was previous show and to the border 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.470
 clear clear all the matter that there was 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.760
 until he came to west germany in the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.229
 negotiation of that fight in the main 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.150
 event and I think it was a very 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.280
 last year's magical I hope that 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.250
 we can see soon since I named 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.650
 wrestlers at the graphic level and the year 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.660
 past it was noticeable that it was good that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.430
 a bit what has improved but neither 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.289
 you believe that there is little band did not 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.090
 I think it has improved a lot in that 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.100
 set apart so we have been told to 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.300
 have captured new movements we saw a 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.090
 end value one of the stars 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.490
 emergent from nextive doing their 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.039
 motion capture tasks 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 and that's interesting, but let's go 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.310
 The truth is that if I expected a great 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.220
 graphic change unfortunately not no 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.270
 I think it's seen so far we've seen 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.580
 very little what you are seeing now 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.139
 same is the content that has been shown 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.639
 here in the mind buy technically 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.050
 Alberto was not even in a state 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.479
 playable something that had been usual 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.910
 in the games with passes and to finish 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.639
 how are they doing and why is this 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.810
 wrestler is selected is 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.490
 Good injured and the people are very 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.800
 pessimistic with the state of danielle 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.169
 it seems that he could even retire 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.199
 soon however he is super 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.509
 optimistic and it seems that we go do not rule out 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.789
 nor be main event in our 32nd year or 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:28.900
 imagine all this that Alberto was 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.120
 doing a show with the spectators and 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.610
 commented that his intention was to win the 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500
 royal rumble 2016 to be main event in 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.449
 west theme or 332, so I'm telling you 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.759
 he is very convinced that he will do 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.949
 something big this year or next year 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.349
 better said and it will recover completely 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.690
 let's not forget shawn michaels also had 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.070
 a super bestial injury in the middle of 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.890
 90 for 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.420
 an accident with the undertaker at the end 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.040
 ended up going back to the 2000s 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.330
 and like oil paintings that you need to 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.100
 Count has probably been your best 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.110
 some will say that the gel for 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.030
 quite was much better in the 90s but 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.590
 I think that in the 2000s he had one of the 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.730
 most interesting moments of his career 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.740
 in any case Alberto and closing ww 216 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.330
 It looks great if you're a fan 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.280
 of wrestling you will love what 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.410
 you are going to read in this video game and it seems 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.200
 that yoox is finally going to make the leap to 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.660
 new generation with this production 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.670
 after 12 to 15 it was fine but 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.620
 maybe not everything we can expect from 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.480
 he was also hard that the 2 k I think that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.910
 it was in 214 we had this in mode 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.830
 western man and 30 what is it 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.380
 practically insurmountable albert with the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.330
 which is practically insurmountable so 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.040
 nothing to wait to see what happens and with 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.230
 eager to see this result with 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.160
 that we have friends you already know until 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.760
 next is already 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.760
 jazz
