00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
in India or anywhere women in society or

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.369 
in India or anywhere women in society or
people<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.030> society<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.110> greater

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
people in society when there is greater

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.069 
people in society when there is greater
respect<00:00:43.890> greater<00:00:44.610> dignity<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.420> women<00:00:45.780> that's

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
respect greater dignity for women that's

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
respect greater dignity for women that's
when<00:00:46.410> things<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> change<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
when things are going to change because

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
when things are going to change because
of<00:00:48.059> some<00:00:48.210> extent<00:00:48.629> cinema<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> reflection<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
of some extent cinema is a reflection of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
of some extent cinema is a reflection of
what<00:00:51.090> happens<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.629> society<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.100> when

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
what happens in society so I think when

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
what happens in society so I think when
that<00:00:53.399> changes<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.199> portrayal

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that changes that's when the portrayal

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
that changes that's when the portrayal
of<00:00:55.800> women<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.280> also<00:00:56.579> become<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.059> layered

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of women will also become more layered

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.200 
of women will also become more layered
it<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.260> become<00:00:58.590> stronger<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.699> will<00:00:59.879> become

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it will become stronger it will become

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
it will become stronger it will become
strong<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.899> vulnerable<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> means<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
strong and vulnerable but it means it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
strong and vulnerable but it means it
will<00:01:02.820> become<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.359> edged<00:01:03.899> instead<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> just

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
will become more edged instead of just

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
will become more edged instead of just
sort<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.700> making<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> frothy<00:01:06.960> and

addressed this issue and I'm saying this

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.200 
addressed this issue and I'm saying this
like<00:04:47.720> 12<00:04:48.050> years<00:04:48.350> ago<00:04:48.500> there<00:04:49.250> was<00:04:49.460> much<00:04:49.880> less<00:04:49.910> a

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
like 12 years ago there was much less a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.510 
like 12 years ago there was much less a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
conversation about this and that is one

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.490 
conversation about this and that is one
film<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.120> think<00:04:53.450> created<00:04:53.840> enough<00:04:54.139> debate

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
film that I think created enough debate

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.650 
film that I think created enough debate
to<00:04:55.010> actually<00:04:55.550> bring<00:04:55.790> that<00:04:55.970> subject<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.510> the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
to actually bring that subject to the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.900 
to actually bring that subject to the
forefront<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:57.979> know<00:04:58.280> when<00:04:58.430> we<00:04:58.550> say<00:04:58.729> that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
forefront so you know when we say that

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.520 
forefront so you know when we say that

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
concerned about it there is a lot of

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.250 
concerned about it there is a lot of

shrinking<00:05:53.130> for<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.910> but<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.120> don't<00:05:54.360> think<00:05:54.510> it's

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
shrinking for it but I don't think it's

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.330

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
riots all of that in India for years

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.040 
riots all of that in India for years
since<00:06:43.080> partition<00:06:43.740> before<00:06:44.130> that<00:06:44.340> but<00:06:45.210> when

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
since partition before that but when

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.610 
since partition before that but when
when<00:06:46.860> a<00:06:46.890> majority<00:06:47.669> party<00:06:47.960> becomes<00:06:48.960> communal

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
when a majority party becomes communal

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.350 
when a majority party becomes communal
then<00:06:49.830> it<00:06:49.919> can<00:06:50.070> almost<00:06:50.220> become<00:06:50.490> fascist<00:06:51.150> and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
then it can almost become fascist and

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.020 
then it can almost become fascist and
that's<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.350> fear<00:06:52.650> so<00:06:53.250> there<00:06:53.430> are<00:06:53.580> people<00:06:53.790> who

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
that's the fear so there are people who

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.100 
that's the fear so there are people who
are<00:06:54.390> very<00:06:54.660> communal<00:06:55.650> but<00:06:56.370> I<00:06:57.030> think<00:06:57.690> like<00:06:57.960> I

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
are very communal but I think like I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.110 
are very communal but I think like I
said<00:06:58.140> the<00:06:58.560> people<00:06:58.710> at<00:06:59.070> large<00:06:59.340> are<00:06:59.640> basically

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120

secular<00:07:00.720> so<00:07:01.260> apart<00:07:02.040> from<00:07:02.250> certain<00:07:02.580> pockets<00:07:03.060> in

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
secular so apart from certain pockets in

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.750 
secular so apart from certain pockets in
the<00:07:03.510> country<00:07:03.930> I<00:07:04.169> don't<00:07:04.770> think<00:07:05.130> it<00:07:05.220> has<00:07:05.400> spread

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
the country I don't think it has spread

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.180
