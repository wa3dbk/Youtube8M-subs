00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello bac today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.189
 show how to make directions 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.080
 very simple with a small pearl saÃ¯d 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.580
 dangling ears but not very slow 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 frankly really not very long 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.540
 because that's what's so much 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.270
 asked for people who have full 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 to hang in the hair or that he 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 just do not have the long ones 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.320
 ears so you have to god of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.960
 aluminum in 2010 puts in the clamp 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 flat the cutting pliers so to lose 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 one for each earring and one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 pair of datawind would have so there is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 really little more counts easier 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 includes the pearl son here you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.559
 concede seen the coil so the wire a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.780
 poplar here we are simply turning 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 around the pearl 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 here we are crushing the end of the wire 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.719
 against the inter to not slip or 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.949
 injured so that's not what it gives 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.420
 we cut a little bit higher 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.840
 felt put a dime to finish 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 higher up to prepare the second pair 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 we ended up not sure about anything like 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 that we did really identical otherwise we 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.240
 can cut shorter longer in 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.689
 do not necessarily pay attention exactly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 mango and kehl in similar cup 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:35.150
 forced to really flatten it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.150
 via the border because like that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.869
 to understand the first we put 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 one next to the other at Adam's neck 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.829
 hunger 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.619
 so here we are real devices 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.810
 identical 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.520
 so think well 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.640
 so here I'm going to farm and in that sense 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 there but some would like in 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.079
 this one points it to the back if 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.710
 I affirm in the other we do the inverted 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.710
 ultimately 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.500
 it will be more fun 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.000
 that would want to be the place 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
 So this is what it looks more like 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:34.489
 with the water yet have the thread in the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.650
 same meaning the task of you ears to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:45.500
 the outside finally of a point that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:47.480
 does not change the same one tightens and so 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.989
 there we have a pair of ears twice 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.670
 the same very simple to do in 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.819
 frankly it is you will have the most 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.900
 single minus 10 and that are 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.010
 relatively nice that please a lot 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.310
