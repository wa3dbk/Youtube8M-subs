that let's go to settings and understand

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.359 
that let's go to settings and understand
the<00:00:14.759> different<00:00:15.120> modes<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.870> has<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.070> scroll

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
down you get a battery option for now if

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
down you get a battery option for now if
you<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.410> something<00:00:22.680> called<00:00:23.310> power

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you see there is something called power

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.060 
you see there is something called power

earlier<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.180> earlier<00:00:27.539> versions<00:00:27.930> there

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
earlier in the earlier versions there

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
earlier in the earlier versions there
used<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.680> battery<00:00:29.130> savings<00:00:29.689> setting

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
used to be a battery savings setting

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
used to be a battery savings setting
also<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.619> now<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.250> only<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.579> settings

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
also but now we have only two settings

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
also but now we have only two settings
which<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.390> balanced<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> default

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which is balanced which is default

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
which is balanced which is default
setting<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> high<00:00:35.910> performance<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
setting and which is high performance so

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
setting and which is high performance so
when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> click<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> balance<00:00:38.219> only<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.910> coats

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
when you click on balance only two coats

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
when you click on balance only two coats
of<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> quad-core<00:00:39.989> phone<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.469> active<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of this quad-core phone is active and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
of this quad-core phone is active and
your<00:00:42.120> battery<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> saved<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> whole

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
your battery is saved because the whole

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430 
your battery is saved because the whole
four<00:00:44.610> cores<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.450> running<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
four cores are not well running if you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
four cores are not well running if you
click<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.739> high-performance<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.670> phone

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
click on high-performance for phone

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.590 
click on high-performance for phone
becomes<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:49.230> active<00:00:49.530> powerful<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
becomes more active powerful but your

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
becomes more active powerful but your
battery<00:00:52.170> drainage<00:00:52.620> could<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.399> because

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
battery drainage could be more because

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
battery drainage could be more because
it<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.300> using<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> four<00:00:55.350> cores<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.219> quad<00:00:57.030> core

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it is using the four cores or quad core

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
it is using the four cores or quad core
of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> system<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.910> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of the system so this is how you can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
of the system so this is how you can
change<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> settings<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.350> power<00:01:01.770> settings<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
change the settings or power settings of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
change the settings or power settings of
the<00:01:02.699> Nero<00:01:03.210> phone<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.989> example<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> need

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the Nero phone for example if you need

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
the Nero phone for example if you need
something<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.760> processed<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.590> fast

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
something to be processed to very fast

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
something to be processed to very fast
you<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> faster<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> processor<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you have a faster need of processor you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
you have a faster need of processor you
can<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> higher<00:01:11.280> power<00:01:11.790> mode

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
can go for the higher power mode

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.929 
can go for the higher power mode
otherwise<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.439> balance<00:01:13.770> mode<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.130> fine<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
otherwise the balance mode is fine the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.929 
otherwise the balance mode is fine the
other<00:01:15.180> option<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:16.080> prefer<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.700> is
