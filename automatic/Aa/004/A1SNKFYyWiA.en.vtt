00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello and welcome back 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.560
 last agricultural simulator 2013 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.540
 with me mac minis and nice that you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 turned back on today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.549
 we have a small baler 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.279
 Year she is really small from the skin 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 and yes I do not think it's that great 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 like the original presses now 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.539
 here are just quite red 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.779
 pulls something used out but otherwise 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 yes, I like that pretty much 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.170
 you can already see that concern metal 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.550
 that means she has been neat 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 worked the press is indeed otherwise 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.670
 It's actually quite a fancy and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.579
 I just want to see you guys 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 Introduce the first five stars motto 'the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.100
 or four and a half hours 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 I do not know exactly and she has 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 some features and she can stop 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 What other press next to not 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.520
 we can and we can just that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 first turn to the back to the two 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 press or we look 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.460
 First of all to the dealer just like that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.860
 how to always do so and that's it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 the seventh 224 away / 1 is has one 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 far from what 178 is needed 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.909
 here 38 kilometers no clue 28 5 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.720
 kw I think 38 ps maintenance so the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.770
 entertainment costs 15 euros per day 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.960
 hay and straw to ruffle it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 this is exactly the case here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.909
 motto in it all were involved in the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.799
 script and so on and so forth 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 and yes the good piece cost 12,000 so 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 very cheap and we have just 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.030
 here are a few features and that is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.399
 if we press the button now 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.700
 then it works out once and if so 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.439
 Now press the key 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.880
 then there's something going on in the back 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 Exactly we can here still another trailer 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520
 dranhÃ¤ngen 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.610
 I did not do that now 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 why explain your moment 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.899
 moment the button n 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.899
 yes, exactly 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.709
 moment just like that with the taste 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.569
 body here this slap this 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.310
 add it to the back and press the k key 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.900
 Can you fold the high down like that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.519
 now the device is almost the first time 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.989
 workaholic you can do it that way 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.069
 you do not have to do it that way I show 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.120
 Now something good for you 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.120
 namely, you can turn on the baler 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.620
 heard she runs up here working the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.730
 small arm 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.079
 In any case, I like that very much 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.799
 we'll look at it all over again 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.359
 from the outside 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:56.919
 everything is animated here as well 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:01.180
 Citizens from South Tyrol I like it that way 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:04.389
 and otherwise with the key r moment 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.340
 oh so with the key r the chamber 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.889
 activate both meters with the key n 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.859
 take care of the resetten and we drive 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.590
 now just go slowly so there 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.299
 that does not happen at all 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:24.329
 good piece still fold down moment 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.329
 moment moment open panel 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.680
 aha kloos panel 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.530
 Now you have to hand by your scarce yes 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.640
 So round now you have to 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.740
 actually work now 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.370
 it does not work as well as shows 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.770
 Now just give it a boost 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.510
 So once the throw incredibly 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.200
 many bales with once out jagged zack 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.100
 zack or freak out the back 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.630
 clubs clubs clubs clubs so if now 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.500
 another trailer in the bale 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.330
 trailer trailer hangs on it then 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.600
 can you just the two on the same 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.190
 draufladen trailer but the problem is 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.660
 at the whole thing I have there now 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.040
 no pendant hung on it appreciated 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.590
 was able to do but I have just 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.240
 still no trailer found where the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.590
 bales stay on it and then 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.090
 I do not want to do that if 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680
 the sideways then now everywhere 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.690
 fall down and I think that's easy 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 not great or shit and looks like 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.550
 that's why i just show you this 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.110
 so you know yes you know what meant 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.110
 so wait a minute 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:48.510
 Occupation access points right there you can 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:52.470
 to make noise so the key mbH 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.990
 them that again almost always the 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:03.180
 Here again fold together with the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:05.040
 It's okay for women, that's exactly how it was 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.040
 namely, but so theoretical 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:13.200
 would have to go now so moment 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.500
 the good thing is not why 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.500
 not you 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.870
 exactly 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.760
 so come let's go 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.060
 yeah, the bavarians were freaking out like that 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:35.080
 just back out of the ordinary so normal can 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:40.810
 the good part on bees also everything 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.940
 so no problem and you already see it 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.530
 are extremely small two the rear 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.970
 comes out and it's extremely extreme 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.730
 so many bales that's really 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.080
 violently and yes otherwise there is 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.600
 actually to not further 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.190
 say so that's so well I know too 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.930
 So dont use it in let's play 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.700
 Do not have but stretched alongside alcoholic beverages 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.460
 introduce the one who wants to use 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.170
 because you want to turn it on the trailer 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.310
 Of course, that can do the download link 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.480
 As always you can find it in the video 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.490
 We will just leave the description 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.900
 thumb because if you like it there times 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.130
 you pull even more because the people the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.600
 latest subscribed easy 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.420
 and yes I wish you much more 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.810
 fun on my channel and for mine 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:20.640
 big one more fat hhm to the 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.640
 next coups
