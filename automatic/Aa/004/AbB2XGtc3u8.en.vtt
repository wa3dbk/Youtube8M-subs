grace note right before that right as

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
grace note right before that right as
you're<00:00:41.309> striking<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> other<00:00:42.059> hand<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:43.140> the

you're striking the other hand now the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
you're striking the other hand now the
most<00:00:43.920> important<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.730> flam<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
most important thing about a flam is the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
most important thing about a flam is the
setup<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> mean<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.039> setup<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> get

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
setup and what I mean by setup is to get

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
setup and what I mean by setup is to get
your<00:00:48.270> hands<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.469> position<00:00:49.950> first

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
your hands in the right position first

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
your hands in the right position first
before<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.789> strike<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.230> would<00:00:52.379> be

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
before you strike it and that would be

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
before you strike it and that would be
one<00:00:53.039> hand<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.360> other<00:00:54.390> hand<00:00:54.719> close<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
one hand up and the other hand close to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
one hand up and the other hand close to
the<00:00:55.140> drum<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> mentioned<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> what

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the drum as I mentioned and this is what

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
the drum as I mentioned and this is what
we<00:00:57.059> call<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.750> flam<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> right

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we call a right flam with the right

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
we call a right flam with the right
stick<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.789> left<00:01:00.059> stick<00:01:00.239> closer<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stick up and the left stick closer to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
stick up and the left stick closer to
the<00:01:00.840> drum<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> play<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the drum when you play it you want to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
the drum when you play it you want to
basically<00:01:03.359> set<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.650> close<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
basically set these down as close as you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
basically set these down as close as you
can<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> each<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.479> without<00:01:06.990> hitting<00:01:07.380> them

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
can to each other without hitting them

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
can to each other without hitting them
exactly<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> same<00:01:08.490> time<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.270> sounds<00:01:09.570> like

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
exactly at the same time it sounds like

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.160 
exactly at the same time it sounds like
this

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.570 

now<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:18.350> important<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.010> understand<00:01:19.490> that

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
now it's important to understand that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.149 
now it's important to understand that
flam's<00:01:19.970> alternate<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.320> after<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.799> strike<00:01:22.040> a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
flam's alternate so after you strike a

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.249 
flam's alternate so after you strike a
right<00:01:22.490> flam<00:01:22.820> your<00:01:23.479> hands<00:01:23.690> will<00:01:23.900> reverse

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
right flam your hands will reverse

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.710 
right flam your hands will reverse
themselves<00:01:25.009> your<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:25.970> hand<00:01:26.240> will<00:01:26.360> start<00:01:26.600> up

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
themselves your right hand will start up

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.050 
themselves your right hand will start up
high<00:01:26.900> you'll<00:01:27.590> strike<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.250> everything<00:01:28.909> will

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
high you'll strike and everything will

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.430 
high you'll strike and everything will
reverse<00:01:29.330> where<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:29.690> left<00:01:29.869> hand<00:01:30.110> now<00:01:30.290> will

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
reverse where your left hand now will

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.889 
reverse where your left hand now will
become<00:01:30.560> high<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.700> right<00:01:31.880> stick<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.390> back

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
become high and the right stick is back

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.440 
become high and the right stick is back
toward<00:01:33.290> snare<00:01:33.860> drum<00:01:34.070> head<00:01:34.250> it'll<00:01:34.940> sound<00:01:35.149> like

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
toward snare drum head it'll sound like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:54.760 
toward snare drum head it'll sound like
this<00:01:50.860> as<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:53.509> mentioned<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.140> most<00:01:54.289> important

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
this as I mentioned the most important

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.230 
this as I mentioned the most important
part<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.070> flam<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.520> setup<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.090> you

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
part of the flam is the setup and you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.249 
part of the flam is the setup and you
want<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.479> make<00:01:56.600> sure<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.869> they're<00:01:57.080> either

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
want to make sure that they're either

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.740 
want to make sure that they're either
not<00:01:57.409> too<00:01:57.920> separated<00:01:58.520> or<00:01:58.970> too<00:01:59.179> close<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.690> each

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
not too separated or too close to each

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.120 
not too separated or too close to each
other<00:01:59.929> where<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:00.259> land<00:02:00.500> right<00:02:00.740> on<00:02:00.860> top<00:02:01.100> of

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
other where they land right on top of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.309 
other where they land right on top of
each<00:02:01.310> other<00:02:01.550> remember<00:02:02.360> as<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:02.810> alternate

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
each other remember as you alternate

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.200 
each other remember as you alternate
make<00:02:03.890> sure<00:02:04.039> your<00:02:04.220> sticks<00:02:04.550> reverse<00:02:04.940> themselves

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
make sure your sticks reverse themselves

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.600 
make sure your sticks reverse themselves
and<00:02:05.720> go<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.319> that<00:02:06.409> even<00:02:06.830> sound<00:02:07.159> on<00:02:07.399> either

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
and go for that even sound on either
