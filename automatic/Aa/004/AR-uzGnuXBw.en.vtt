00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.809
 [Music] 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 [Applause] 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.680
 today we have real children 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.439
 barbecue really barbecue of course 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 but you can really play with it 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.810
 because summer is coming, I thought 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.590
 let's see how nice this is 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 because in June 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 Mom or dad will probably go once 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.280
 barbecuing in the summer and with this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.600
 you can play a toy barbecue 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.600
 well let's open it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:54.429
 [Music] 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:17.300
 [Music] 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:17.300
 so that you have the barbecue democracy 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:36.910
 [Music] 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:42.370
 and two shows the right 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.370
 [Music] 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.720

00:01:47.350 --> 00:02:04.510
 [Music] 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:08.290
 already of this is the lighter 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.560
 to light the barbecue this is saved 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.210
 because you're going to flip the burger more 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.830
 [Music] 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.030
 [Applause] 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.550

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:30.240
 to do a fish between you can 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:31.470
 nice fish and you have a pair of tongs here 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.970
 there you can, for example, the hamburger 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:52.070
 meepak then we turn around here 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:52.070
 cutting board with a large-scale 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:05.769
 a plate with a knife and fork 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.769
 [Music] 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.140
 we still have salt and pepper here 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:23.599
 jetway knees for you 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.599
 [Music] 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.009
 [Music] 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 [Music] 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.630
 hamburger little drawers two more 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.889

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:12.030

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.829
 [Music] 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.750
 so we measure chip state so that 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:25.320
 going at a hamburger is a 2 yr 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:27.010
 [Music] 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.620

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.370

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:55.060

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.699
 [Applause] 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.990

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.990

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.690
 [Music] 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.819

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.819

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:34.529
