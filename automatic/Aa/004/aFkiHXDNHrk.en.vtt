00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.890
 to finish the program what I want 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.420
 to do is solve a problem that many 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.040
 Sometimes we have people when we go 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.120
 to share a pizza 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.280
 suppose you go in a pizzeria 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.900
 and it's really good to buy the pool 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.240
 he takes it to the house and the pizza comes 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.010
 uncut and discussions like the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.510
 we start in such a way that the quantity 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.199
 of pizza that you and I are going to eat 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.270
 be the same 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.220
 the temptation is always to say we stop 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.630
 cut in the middle and a few is 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 worried about knowing if indeed 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.609
 short in the center but it turns out that the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.500
 mathematics has other ideas and we will 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.929
 help you to realize that having 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.600
 so much privilege in the middle at the end 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.840
 it's irrelevant had oscar oscar is going to me 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.280
 help 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.949
 how about oscar how are you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 Oscar cuts first the pizza as the 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.460
 they normally cut a pizza either 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 start with that as you cut it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 normally of course that oscar is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.680
 dedicate to this is professional to cut 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.720
 pizzas and then when the cut does 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 so the important point for him 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.540
 obviously it is to have reached the center and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.830
 then cut to 90 degrees and then to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.990
 45 degrees 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.080
 but now the extraordinary thing is that the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.040
 Mathematics provides a solution 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 regardless of what Oscar 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000
 cut in this way one does not need 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.700
 when you buy a pizza bring a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 specialist cutting pizzas cut it in 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.790
 place of by the center cut it in 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.470
 any other place where you can think of 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.390
 a little bit more, that's a little bit more 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.190
 There are even beyond cutting 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.650
 notice what the cut does in 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.750
 any part once done that now 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.869
 short perpendicularly in 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.100
 anywhere when you do that notice 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.990
 that now was what usually 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.050
 is that the center is now left 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.060
 run however now it cuts like this or 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.690
 be perpendicular as if it were 45 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 dale degrees 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 barbarian and now grab and cut it from the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.960
 same way but as well as consume 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.840
 agreed as if it had been the center 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.810
 in that case then the math says 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.570
 look, you put the daughter in this way 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.050
 a portion here leaves an olive tape 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.869
 one with one without one with a sim and one 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.970
 with if someone keeps these four 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.819
 portions of the olives 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.190
 that I can not separate good if one 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.250
 does that and the other eats the other part 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.720
 they both eat the same amount of pizza and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.410
 this is what mathematics shows 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.030
 you can describe and rotate the center not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.060
 it needs to be in the center thanks 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 oscar this what it shows is that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.959
 when one is so worried about 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.480
 find the center in a pizza by 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.209
 example does not need to put so much 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.340
 beware that essentially reaches 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.030
 with choosing any point and then if 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.120
 go making cuts at 45 degrees a 90 90 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.790
 45 45 and with that the problem is solved 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.580
 we finished the program with this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.800
 who appears funny is fun is 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.989
 practical has the appearance of 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.329
 seduction that you see when you have to 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.340
 eat pizza and the math as pere 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.349
 for this too 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.390
 thank you because you allowed us to 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.190
 us part of your day enter 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.190
 at home until the next opportunity 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.960
 na
