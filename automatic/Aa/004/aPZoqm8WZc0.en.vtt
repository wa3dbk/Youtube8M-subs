00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.050 
and stuff like that again so you can
search<00:03:07.099> for<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.400> YouTube<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.299> they<00:03:08.959> also<00:03:09.139> had

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
search for on YouTube and they also had

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.179 
search for on YouTube and they also had
interviews<00:03:11.060> with<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.389> cast<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:12.560> if<00:03:12.950> I'm<00:03:13.069> not

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
interviews with the cast and if I'm not

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.650 
interviews with the cast and if I'm not
mistaken<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.699> was<00:03:13.910> actually<00:03:14.180> done<00:03:14.329> just

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
mistaken that was actually done just

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.569 
mistaken that was actually done just
with<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.959> DVD<00:03:15.620> that's<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.280> way<00:03:16.400> they're

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
with the DVD that's the way they're

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.979 
with the DVD that's the way they're
talking<00:03:16.790> about<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.510> seemed<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
talking about it it seemed to be in

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.860 
talking about it it seemed to be in
hindsight<00:03:18.319> after<00:03:18.889> Daria<00:03:19.220> had<00:03:19.340> been<00:03:19.459> concluded

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
hindsight after Daria had been concluded

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.599 
hindsight after Daria had been concluded
so<00:03:20.870> maybe<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.199> wasn't<00:03:21.349> just<00:03:21.530> for<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.889> DVD<00:03:22.250> but

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
so maybe it wasn't just for the DVD but

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.699 
so maybe it wasn't just for the DVD but
I<00:03:22.639> think<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.120> was<00:03:23.209> done<00:03:23.449> later<00:03:24.139> on<00:03:24.349> down<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
I think it was done later on down the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.649 
I think it was done later on down the
road<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.699> yeah<00:03:26.060> that's<00:03:26.269> pretty<00:03:26.329> much<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.569> for

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
road so yeah that's pretty much it for

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.569 
road so yeah that's pretty much it for
the<00:03:26.780> special<00:03:26.930> features<00:03:27.379> there's<00:03:27.650> nothing

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
the special features there's nothing

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.369 
the special features there's nothing
overly<00:03:29.000> spectacular<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:29.989> mean<00:03:30.169> if<00:03:30.260> you're

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379

specifically that bothered me is take
for<00:03:58.159> instance<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.669> have<00:03:58.720> episodes<00:03:59.720> 1<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.169> 9<00:04:00.349> on

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
for instance you have episodes 1 to 9 on

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.640 
for instance you have episodes 1 to 9 on
there

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
there

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.219 
there
11<00:04:03.650> or<00:04:03.769> 10<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.040> 13<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.699> then<00:04:04.849> season<00:04:05.180> 2<00:04:05.750> and

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
11 or 10 to 13 and then season 2 and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.339 
11 or 10 to 13 and then season 2 and
it's<00:04:06.530> just<00:04:06.729> 1<00:04:07.729> to<00:04:07.849> 5<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.269> season<00:04:08.449> 2<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.989> thought

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
it's just 1 to 5 of season 2 I thought

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.180 
it's just 1 to 5 of season 2 I thought
that<00:04:09.440> was<00:04:09.530> kind<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.709> annoying<00:04:09.979> especially

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
that was kind of annoying especially

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.670 
that was kind of annoying especially
when<00:04:10.930> they<00:04:11.930> could<00:04:12.079> have<00:04:12.169> splitted<00:04:12.500> up<00:04:12.530> a

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
when they could have splitted up a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.949 
when they could have splitted up a
little<00:04:12.919> more<00:04:13.069> neatly<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.790> noticed<00:04:14.419> for

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
little more neatly I noticed for

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.500 
little more neatly I noticed for
instance<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.039> OSI<00:04:16.400> DVDs<00:04:16.789> they<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.239> maybe

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
instance the OSI DVDs they have maybe

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.080 
instance the OSI DVDs they have maybe
pre<00:04:17.870> 4<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> disc

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
pre 4 so the disc

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.900 
pre 4 so the disc
so<00:04:19.180> manages<00:04:19.540> Jam<00:04:19.870> nah<00:04:20.109> noticed<00:04:20.790> wouldn't<00:04:21.790> have

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
so manages Jam nah noticed wouldn't have

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.090 
so manages Jam nah noticed wouldn't have
killed<00:04:22.060> him<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.330> take<00:04:22.530> 13<00:04:23.530> episodes<00:04:23.889> per

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
killed him to take 13 episodes per

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.620 
killed him to take 13 episodes per
season<00:04:24.130> just<00:04:24.669> put<00:04:24.790> them<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.419> it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
season just put them on to just it

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.850 
season just put them on to just it
would've<00:04:25.810> been<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.960> little<00:04:26.169> more<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.410> mass<00:04:26.590> but

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
would've been a little more of mass but

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.580 
would've been a little more of mass but
again<00:04:27.550> that's<00:04:27.700> minor<00:04:27.970> nitpicky<00:04:28.419> stuff<00:04:28.660> go<00:04:29.440> buy

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
again that's minor nitpicky stuff go buy
