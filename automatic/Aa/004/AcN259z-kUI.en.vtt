would shoot at 30 frames per second 24

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.300 
would shoot at 30 frames per second 24
frames<00:00:31.820> per<00:00:31.910> second<00:00:32.890> specialized<00:00:33.890> frame<00:00:34.130> rate

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
frames per second specialized frame rate

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.580 
frames per second specialized frame rate
like<00:00:34.489> 60<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.239> then<00:00:35.300> play<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.720> back<00:00:35.899> at<00:00:36.110> 24

like 60 and then play it back at 24
frames<00:00:36.829> per<00:00:36.920> second<00:00:37.370> for<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.550> slow-motion

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
frames per second for that slow-motion

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.330 
frames per second for that slow-motion
effect<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.079> then<00:00:39.500> maybe<00:00:39.770> we'll<00:00:39.920> even<00:00:40.070> talk<00:00:40.190> a

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
menu and take a look at where our frame

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.630 
menu and take a look at where our frame
rates<00:00:48.230> are<00:00:48.440> okay<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.070> then<00:00:49.219> we'll<00:00:49.399> talk<00:00:49.609> a

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
rates are okay and then we'll talk a

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.209 
rates are okay and then we'll talk a
little<00:00:49.910> bit<00:00:50.120> about<00:00:50.149> that<00:00:50.510> look<00:00:50.839> so<00:00:51.769> we<00:00:51.890> go<00:00:52.070> in

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
little bit about that look so we go in

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.959 
little bit about that look so we go in
there<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.079> movie<00:00:54.079> record<00:00:54.440> size<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.309> on<00:00:55.789> each

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
there and movie record size and on each

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.400 
there and movie record size and on each
of<00:00:56.179> the<00:00:56.300> cameras<00:00:56.749> it's<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.170> slightly

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
of the cameras it's in a slightly

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.259 
of the cameras it's in a slightly
different<00:00:57.620> place<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.730> just<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.059> find

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
different place so you just have to find

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.149 
different place so you just have to find
where<00:00:59.539> we<00:00:59.570> actually<00:00:59.780> have<00:01:00.109> those<00:01:00.350> frame<00:01:00.920> rates

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
where we actually have those frame rates

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.819 
where we actually have those frame rates
and<00:01:01.399> if<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:02.239> go<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.570> there<00:01:02.839> we'll<00:01:03.050> see<00:01:03.109> what<00:01:03.769> do

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
and if we go in there we'll see what do

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.750 
and if we go in there we'll see what do
we<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.250> we've<00:01:04.339> got<00:01:04.489> all<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.670> different

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
we see so we've got all the different

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.820 
we see so we've got all the different
flavors<00:01:05.089> again<00:01:05.480> this<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.020> 7d<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.650> we've

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
flavors again this is the 7d so we've

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.490 
flavors again this is the 7d so we've

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
right right and a lot of what we grew up

with sitcoms the news news right reality
shows<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> lot<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.880> those<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.539> some<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:47.960> those

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
shows a lot of those and some of those

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.510 
shows a lot of those and some of those
nature<00:01:48.380> shows<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.860> things<00:01:49.039> like<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.189> are

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
nature shows and things like that are

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.550 
nature shows and things like that are
usually<00:01:49.640> shot<00:01:49.969> at<00:01:50.270> 30<00:01:50.780> frames<00:01:51.020> per<00:01:51.110> second

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
usually shot at 30 frames per second

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.740 
usually shot at 30 frames per second
exactly<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.159> when<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.369> see<00:01:52.609> 30<00:01:52.969> here<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.659> when

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
exactly and when we see 30 here and when

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.420 
exactly and when we see 30 here and when
we<00:01:53.780> say<00:01:54.109> 30<00:01:54.409> frames<00:01:54.710> per<00:01:54.890> second<00:01:55.219> we're

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
we say 30 frames per second we're

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.980 
we say 30 frames per second we're
actually<00:01:55.579> talking<00:01:55.880> about<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.420> broadcast

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
actually talking about the broadcast

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.889 
actually talking about the broadcast
standard<00:01:57.500> which<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:57.789> 29.97<00:01:58.789> frames<00:01:59.659> per

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
standard which is 29.97 frames per

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.200 
standard which is 29.97 frames per
second<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:00.649> when<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:01.100> say<00:02:01.340> 30<00:02:01.670> that's<00:02:02.000> what

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
second so when we say 30 that's what

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.090 
second so when we say 30 that's what
we're<00:02:02.299> referring<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.630> right<00:02:03.109> so<00:02:03.289> now<00:02:03.560> let's<00:02:03.590> go

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
we're referring to right so now let's go

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.099 
we're referring to right so now let's go
ahead<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.640> talk<00:02:04.820> about<00:02:04.850> 24<00:02:05.600> frames<00:02:05.899> per

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
ahead and talk about 24 frames per

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.160 
ahead and talk about 24 frames per
second<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.679> what<00:02:07.460> that's<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.909> about<00:02:08.170> switch

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
second and what that's all about switch

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.620 
second and what that's all about switch
over<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.470> 24<00:02:10.100> yeah<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:10.940> once<00:02:11.120> we're<00:02:11.300> changing

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
over to 24 yeah so once we're changing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.790 
over to 24 yeah so once we're changing
our<00:02:11.720> frame<00:02:11.960> rates<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> keep<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.770> mind

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
our frame rates for you to keep in mind

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.150 
our frame rates for you to keep in mind
to<00:02:13.280> adjust<00:02:14.030> our<00:02:14.180> shutter<00:02:14.390> speeds<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.840> well

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
to adjust our shutter speeds as well

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.690 
to adjust our shutter speeds as well
appropriately<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.280> I'll<00:02:16.370> go<00:02:16.490> ahead<00:02:16.520> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
appropriately so I'll go ahead and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.580 
appropriately so I'll go ahead and
switch<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.090> over<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.570> 50th<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> second

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
switch that over to a 50th of a second

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.440 
switch that over to a 50th of a second
so<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.340> motion<00:02:19.580> blur<00:02:20.000> exact

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
so we got the right motion blur exact

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.330 
so we got the right motion blur exact
everything<00:02:20.810> okay<00:02:21.080> good<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:21.800> now<00:02:22.010> we're

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
everything okay good and so now we're

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.670 
everything okay good and so now we're
seeing<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:23.450> little<00:02:23.900> bit<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.319> difference<00:02:24.620> here

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
seeing a little bit of a difference here

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.860 
seeing a little bit of a difference here
because<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.129> we're<00:02:25.370> shooting<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:26.060> six<00:02:26.420> frames

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
because now we're shooting at six frames

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.259 
because now we're shooting at six frames
per<00:02:27.230> second<00:02:27.560> less<00:02:27.860> right<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> really

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
per second less right and this is really

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.420 
per second less right and this is really
the<00:02:29.450> frame<00:02:29.690> rate<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.290> has<00:02:30.530> been<00:02:30.800> used<00:02:31.129> as<00:02:31.400> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the frame rate that has been used as a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.729 
the frame rate that has been used as a
standard<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.239> very<00:02:32.629> long<00:02:32.900> time<00:02:32.930> for

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
standard for a very long time for

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.130 
standard for a very long time for
feature<00:02:33.950> films<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.330> we<00:02:35.569> associate

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
feature films right and so we associate

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.729 
feature films right and so we associate
that<00:02:36.430> shutter<00:02:37.430> speed<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:39.019> associate<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
that shutter speed and we associate that

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.800 
that shutter speed and we associate that
frame<00:02:39.980> rate<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.550> filmmakers<00:02:41.180> film<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.569> of

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
frame rate with a filmmakers film and of

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.330 
frame rate with a filmmakers film and of
course<00:02:42.050> now<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.680> cameras<00:02:43.069> like<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
course now that we have cameras like the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.309 
course now that we have cameras like the
EOS<00:02:43.519> HD<00:02:43.910> cameras<00:02:44.269> with<00:02:44.420> these<00:02:44.569> huge<00:02:44.840> sensors

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
EOS HD cameras with these huge sensors

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.339 
EOS HD cameras with these huge sensors
and<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.489> get<00:02:46.640> selective<00:02:47.269> focus<00:02:47.630> we<00:02:48.049> really

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
and we can get selective focus we really

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.720 
and we can get selective focus we really
have<00:02:48.500> all<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> ingredients<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.580> we<00:02:49.700> need

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
have all of the ingredients that we need

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.630 
have all of the ingredients that we need
to<00:02:50.480> create<00:02:50.690> cinematic<00:02:51.349> looking<00:02:51.650> stuff<00:02:51.860> so

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
to create cinematic looking stuff so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.710 
to create cinematic looking stuff so
it's<00:02:52.790> good<00:02:52.970> stuff<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.510> course

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it's good stuff and of course

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.020 
it's good stuff and of course
interchangeable<00:02:54.319> lens<00:02:54.470> systems<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.400> so

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
interchangeable lens systems so so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.059 
interchangeable lens systems so so
that's<00:02:56.150> great<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.599> now<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.560> other<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:57.950> that

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
that's great so now the other one that

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.789 
that's great so now the other one that
we<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.459> here<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:59.019> 60<00:03:00.019> frames<00:03:00.290> per<00:03:00.380> second

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
we have in here is 60 frames per second

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.789 
we have in here is 60 frames per second
okay<00:03:01.040> go<00:03:01.280> ahead<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.519> switch<00:03:01.760> over<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.060> 60<00:03:02.799> yeah

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
okay go ahead and switch over to 60 yeah

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.470 
okay go ahead and switch over to 60 yeah
and<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.099> course<00:03:04.340> again<00:03:04.670> go<00:03:04.910> ahead<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:05.299> my

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
and of course again go ahead and just my

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.870 
and of course again go ahead and just my
shutter<00:03:05.780> speed<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.140> now<00:03:06.530> we'll<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.739> at<00:03:06.829> 1<00:03:07.040> 125th

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
shutter speed so now we'll be at 1 125th

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.580 
shutter speed so now we'll be at 1 125th
yep<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.840> course<00:03:08.870> now<00:03:09.290> we're

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
yep and then of course now we're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.880 
yep and then of course now we're
exposing<00:03:10.400> each<00:03:10.670> frame<00:03:11.030> less<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.739> to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
exposing each frame less so we have to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.920 
exposing each frame less so we have to
really<00:03:13.250> think<00:03:13.430> about<00:03:13.519> our<00:03:13.970> exposure<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:14.780> now

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
really think about our exposure so now

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.390 
really think about our exposure so now
here<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.200> can<00:03:15.410> see<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.370> very

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
here you can see you know this is very

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.009 
here you can see you know this is very
easy<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.819> see<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.150> gets<00:03:17.299> very<00:03:17.390> smooth<00:03:17.989> very

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
easy to see it gets very smooth very

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.870 
easy to see it gets very smooth very
clean<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:18.950> we're<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.190> adding<00:03:19.640> more

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
clean because we're just adding more

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.789 
clean because we're just adding more
information<00:03:20.030> per<00:03:20.630> second<00:03:21.019> right<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.590> we've

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
information per second right so we've

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.190 
information per second right so we've
got<00:03:22.069> 60<00:03:22.760> frames<00:03:23.000> per<00:03:23.120> second<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.840> looks<00:03:24.110> very

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
got 60 frames per second it looks very

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.979 
got 60 frames per second it looks very
video<00:03:25.000> when<00:03:26.000> we<00:03:26.060> shoot<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.569> way<00:03:26.750> and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
video when we shoot it this way and

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.120 
video when we shoot it this way and
again<00:03:27.079> most<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.620> time<00:03:27.709> when<00:03:28.010> we're

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
again most of the time when we're

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.559 
again most of the time when we're
shooting<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:28.519> 60<00:03:28.790> frames<00:03:29.000> per<00:03:29.090> second<00:03:29.480> we're

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
shooting at 60 frames per second we're

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.509 
shooting at 60 frames per second we're
playing<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:29.989> back<00:03:30.170> at<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> lower<00:03:31.040> frame<00:03:31.459> rate

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
playing it back at a lower frame rate

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.319 
playing it back at a lower frame rate
exactly<00:03:32.299> but<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.750> course<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.260> Internet<00:03:33.920> is

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
exactly but of course the Internet is

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.120 
exactly but of course the Internet is
frame<00:03:35.329> rate<00:03:35.510> agnostic<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.769> could<00:03:36.920> in<00:03:37.100> fact

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
frame rate agnostic so we could in fact

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.830 
frame rate agnostic so we could in fact
edit<00:03:37.880> something<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.389> we<00:03:38.450> can<00:03:38.569> play<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.810> back

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
edit something and we can play it back

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.479 
edit something and we can play it back
at<00:03:39.079> 60<00:03:39.410> frames<00:03:39.620> per<00:03:39.709> second<00:03:40.040> if<00:03:40.100> we<00:03:40.160> wanted<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
at 60 frames per second if we wanted to

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.460 
at 60 frames per second if we wanted to
yep<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:41.510> what<00:03:41.690> we're<00:03:41.840> going<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.989> do<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
yep so now what we're going to do is

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.170 
yep so now what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.829> switch<00:03:43.040> over<00:03:43.310> from<00:03:43.400> NTSC<00:03:44.060> to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
we're going to switch over from NTSC to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.090 
we're going to switch over from NTSC to
PAL<00:03:44.389> because<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.170> lot<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.470> people<00:03:45.739> are<00:03:45.829> shooting

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
PAL because a lot of people are shooting

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.440 
PAL because a lot of people are shooting
all<00:03:46.190> over<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.519> world<00:03:46.700> with<00:03:46.880> these<00:03:46.970> cameras

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
all over the world with these cameras

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.840 
all over the world with these cameras
and<00:03:47.810> they<00:03:48.530> need<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.920> be<00:03:49.040> able<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.340> if<00:03:49.760> a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
and they need to be able to if a

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.670 
and they need to be able to if a
producer<00:03:50.030> says<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.600> them<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:51.230> need<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
producer says to them we need you to

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.190 
producer says to them we need you to
shoot<00:03:51.859> in<00:03:52.190> PAL<00:03:52.540> they<00:03:53.540> need<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.780> be<00:03:53.900> able<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.079> do

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
shoot in PAL they need to be able to do

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.020 
shoot in PAL they need to be able to do
that<00:03:54.319> exactly<00:03:54.739> we<00:03:54.829> get<00:03:55.280> another<00:03:55.459> camera<00:03:55.700> right

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
that exactly we get another camera right

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.340 
that exactly we get another camera right
and<00:03:56.209> out<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> box<00:03:56.720> we<00:03:56.930> can<00:03:57.049> shoot<00:03:57.290> them

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
and out of the box we can shoot them

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.020 
and out of the box we can shoot them
both<00:03:57.500> right<00:03:57.859> with<00:03:58.040> all<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.280> these<00:03:58.400> EOS<00:03:58.700> HD

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
both right with all of these EOS HD

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.920 
both right with all of these EOS HD
cameras<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.389> let's<00:03:59.510> go<00:03:59.600> ahead<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.810> take<00:03:59.900> a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
cameras so let's go ahead and take a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.629 
cameras so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:04:00.049> at<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.350> okay<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.069> of<00:04:01.160> course<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.489> is

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
look at that okay and of course this is

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.250 
look at that okay and of course this is
going<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.819> be<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.120> different<00:04:02.359> place<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:03.049> each

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
going to be in a different place on each

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.620 
going to be in a different place on each
of<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.590> camera<00:04:03.950> systems<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:04.880> we<00:04:04.940> see<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
of the camera systems but we see here it

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.710 
of the camera systems but we see here it
says<00:04:05.810> video<00:04:06.109> system<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.280> NTSC<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.180> PAL

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
says video system and the NTSC and PAL

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720 
says video system and the NTSC and PAL
ok<00:04:09.200> good<00:04:09.410> now<00:04:09.590> what<00:04:09.799> happens<00:04:10.220> when<00:04:10.370> we<00:04:10.459> go<00:04:10.579> back

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
ok good now what happens when we go back

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.370 
ok good now what happens when we go back
to<00:04:10.849> our<00:04:10.940> frame<00:04:11.209> rates<00:04:11.420> when<00:04:11.599> we<00:04:11.690> do<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:11.989> we<00:04:12.260> go

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
to our frame rates when we do that we go

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.839 
to our frame rates when we do that we go
back<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.650> our<00:04:12.739> frame<00:04:13.010> rates<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.489> now<00:04:13.639> going

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
back to our frame rates it's now going

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.599 
back to our frame rates it's now going
to<00:04:13.940> give<00:04:14.120> us<00:04:14.269> slightly<00:04:14.959> different<00:04:15.410> options<00:04:15.769> so

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
to give us slightly different options so

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.629 
to give us slightly different options so
now<00:04:16.810> we're<00:04:17.810> shooting<00:04:17.989> at<00:04:18.260> either<00:04:18.410> 25<00:04:19.099> frames<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
now we're shooting at either 25 frames a

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.480 
now we're shooting at either 25 frames a
second<00:04:19.970> yeah<00:04:20.150> or<00:04:21.019> at<00:04:21.109> 24<00:04:21.590> frames<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:22.010> second<00:04:22.400> or

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
second yeah or at 24 frames a second or

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.300 
second yeah or at 24 frames a second or
for<00:04:22.849> our<00:04:22.940> fast<00:04:23.240> motion<00:04:24.139> are<00:04:24.620> over<00:04:24.950> cranked

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
for our fast motion are over cranked

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.560 
for our fast motion are over cranked
we're<00:04:25.400> going<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.580> be<00:04:25.639> shooting<00:04:25.789> at<00:04:26.030> 50<00:04:26.360> frames

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
we're going to be shooting at 50 frames

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.839 
we're going to be shooting at 50 frames
a<00:04:26.690> second<00:04:26.960> got<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.289> so<00:04:27.440> our<00:04:27.770> pal<00:04:28.160> frame<00:04:28.580> rate

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
a second got it so our pal frame rate

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.960 
a second got it so our pal frame rate
standard<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.690> 25<00:04:30.470> frames<00:04:30.800> per<00:04:30.950> second<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:31.610> if

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
standard is 25 frames per second so if

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.200 
standard is 25 frames per second so if
we're<00:04:32.090> shooting<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.840> know

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
we're shooting you know

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.820 
we're shooting you know
one<00:04:33.479> of<00:04:33.600> those<00:04:33.750> countries<00:04:34.139> or<00:04:34.289> we're<00:04:34.620> being

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
one of those countries or we're being

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.340 
one of those countries or we're being
asked<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.160> shoot<00:04:35.370> pal<00:04:35.970> then<00:04:36.240> we<00:04:36.539> retreat<00:04:36.840> at<00:04:36.930> 25

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
asked to shoot pal then we retreat at 25

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.990 
asked to shoot pal then we retreat at 25
right<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:37.979> they're<00:04:38.130> still<00:04:38.370> giving<00:04:38.639> you<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
right but they're still giving you the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.270 
right but they're still giving you the
option<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:39.660> canon<00:04:39.990> eos<00:04:40.229> HD<00:04:40.800> cameras<00:04:41.160> to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
option on the canon eos HD cameras to

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.370 
option on the canon eos HD cameras to
shoot<00:04:41.460> at<00:04:41.550> 24<00:04:41.669> frames<00:04:42.300> per<00:04:42.389> second<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:42.930> then

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
shoot at 24 frames per second and then

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.230 
shoot at 24 frames per second and then
of<00:04:43.500> course<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:43.979> we<00:04:44.190> want<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.400> over<00:04:44.639> crank<00:04:44.910> or<00:04:45.150> we

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
of course if we want to over crank or we

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.060 
of course if we want to over crank or we
shoot<00:04:45.419> slow<00:04:45.690> motion<00:04:46.050> stuff<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.470> we're<00:04:46.770> set<00:04:47.039> to

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
shoot slow motion stuff and we're set to

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.340 
shoot slow motion stuff and we're set to
pal<00:04:47.340> we<00:04:47.820> can<00:04:48.000> shoot<00:04:48.180> at<00:04:48.300> 50<00:04:48.570> exactly<00:04:49.139> that's

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
pal we can shoot at 50 exactly that's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.450 
pal we can shoot at 50 exactly that's
great<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.710> then<00:04:49.800> just<00:04:49.979> remember<00:04:50.340> your

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
great and then just remember your

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.980 
great and then just remember your
shutter<00:04:50.669> speeds<00:04:50.970> need<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.449> correspond<00:04:51.930> to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
shutter speeds need to correspond to

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.020 
shutter speeds need to correspond to
that<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:52.650> you're<00:04:52.770> shooting<00:04:52.979> at<00:04:53.070> 25<00:04:53.430> frames<00:04:53.789> per

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
that so you're shooting at 25 frames per

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.520 
that so you're shooting at 25 frames per
second<00:04:54.419> at<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.570> fiftieth<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.139> you're

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
second at the fiftieth if you're

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.249 
second at the fiftieth if you're
shooting<00:04:55.710> at<00:04:55.889> 24<00:04:56.370> you're<00:04:56.820> 250th<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.990> because

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
shooting at 24 you're 250th just because

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.810 
shooting at 24 you're 250th just because
that's<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.830> way<00:04:58.919> we<00:04:59.039> set<00:04:59.250> them<00:04:59.340> up<00:04:59.460> on<00:04:59.610> here

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
that's the way we set them up on here

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.360 
that's the way we set them up on here
and<00:04:59.910> then<00:05:00.300> if<00:05:00.419> we're<00:05:00.600> at<00:05:00.810> 50<00:05:01.590> then<00:05:02.039> we'd<00:05:02.220> say

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
and then if we're at 50 then we'd say

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.969 
and then if we're at 50 then we'd say
200<00:05:02.880> yep<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.479> that's<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.560> think<00:05:04.710> what<00:05:04.919> we

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
200 yep and that's it so I think what we

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.430 
200 yep and that's it so I think what we
should<00:05:05.009> do<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.669> we<00:05:05.729> should<00:05:06.090> dip<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.780> black<00:05:06.810> come

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
should do is we should dip to black come

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.589 
should do is we should dip to black come
back<00:05:07.620> up<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.160> we'll<00:05:08.520> roll<00:05:08.729> some<00:05:08.910> footage<00:05:08.940> here

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
back up and we'll roll some footage here

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.050 
back up and we'll roll some footage here
on<00:05:09.750> hope<00:05:10.169> with<00:05:10.500> Brady<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.009> we'll<00:05:11.550> take<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.759> look

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
on hope with Brady and we'll take a look

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.969 
on hope with Brady and we'll take a look
at<00:05:12.210> these<00:05:12.479> different<00:05:12.660> frame<00:05:13.050> rates<00:05:13.289> sometimes

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
at these different frame rates sometimes

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.529 
at these different frame rates sometimes
it's<00:05:14.220> more<00:05:14.400> subtle<00:05:14.639> than<00:05:14.759> others<00:05:15.150> when<00:05:15.389> you're

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
it's more subtle than others when you're

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.370 
it's more subtle than others when you're
looking<00:05:15.810> at<00:05:15.960> 30<00:05:16.229> compared<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:17.330> 24<00:05:18.380> sometimes

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
looking at 30 compared to 24 sometimes

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.439 
looking at 30 compared to 24 sometimes
it's<00:05:19.560> more<00:05:19.740> apparent<00:05:20.190> you'll<00:05:20.639> see<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.300> see

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
it's more apparent you'll see it you see

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.909 
it's more apparent you'll see it you see
a<00:05:21.479> big<00:05:21.690> difference<00:05:22.050> especially<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.500> narrative

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
a big difference especially a narrative

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.680 
a big difference especially a narrative
work<00:05:23.099> when<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.430> see<00:05:23.580> films<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.449> know<00:05:24.479> with

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
work when you see films you know with

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.900 
work when you see films you know with
actors<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.080> things<00:05:25.289> like<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.710> but<00:05:26.340> thank

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
actors and things like that but thank
