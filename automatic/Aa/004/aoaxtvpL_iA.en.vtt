00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 in the village of pocket lives ordinary 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.620
 a woman with a very unusual hobby 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.260
 six months ago is not finished anyone by chance 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.960
 discovered the art of modular 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 origami work colleagues preparing for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.529
 the next exhibition made crafts from 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 colored paper 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.869
 Nina Vladimirovna creative process 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 I got interested in trying myself and even 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.390
 did not notice how fascinated by the creation 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 paper figures seriously and for a long time to me 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 It is very interested so much 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 and I spent the whole evening in the meantime this to her 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 the video did not make it though small but 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 The first time was of course difficult for now. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 not finished i didn't go away and then everything 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 admired so I was pleased there 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 they extinguished joy 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 The origami module has a long history 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.309
 it is first mentioned in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.870
 Japanese Book XI That Hunt in 1743 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.940
 the art of paper plastics exist and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.680
 in Chinese tradition for a long time 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.489
 modular origami features not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.100
 developed and only in 1960 this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.189
 technique re-opened by american robert 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.820
 nail now, this kind of art found 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 its popularity in many countries of the world 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 Modular origami classes are not easy but 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.299
 quite fascinating and without patience and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.270
 plodding here is clearly not enough 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.670
 such figures are made up of the same 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.049
 parts or modules each module 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.200
 going by the rules of the classic 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.570
 origami from one sheet of paper then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
 the module is held together by you in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 such constructions arising in this case 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 friction force allows the figure to be 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.920
 quite stable and the result 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.450
 it turns out such wonderful work 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.729
 1 creative work by nina vladimirovna 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.520
 became this swan to recreate 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.860
 the woman needed only one evening 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 here a handsome goose had to pore 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.520
 whole month to collect figures 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 It took about one and a half thousand 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 paper modules 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.640
 pockets sky craftswoman recognized 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.560
 technically it was the job itself 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 challenging 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.930
 asking questions have you patience then 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.790
 I don't know, I didn't even think about it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.480
 I do it with pleasure and I must 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.570
 a wish 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.390

 like it i will i left even 24 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.380
 hours how many figures have their own collection nina 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.350
 the answer will be difficult 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.420
 says never considered you collections 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.610
 the remaining figures can only be called 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 conditionally, most of the fakes will give and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.170
 friends and acquaintances and colleagues 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.560
