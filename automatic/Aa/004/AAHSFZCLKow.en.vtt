Quattro<00:00:35.830> when<00:00:36.830> you<00:00:36.949> look<00:00:37.100> at<00:00:37.220> these<00:00:37.370> cars

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
Quattro when you look at these cars

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.549 
Quattro when you look at these cars
initially<00:00:38.360> they<00:00:38.780> look<00:00:38.960> very<00:00:39.230> very<00:00:39.350> similar

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
initially they look very very similar

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.650 
initially they look very very similar
but<00:00:40.250> there<00:00:40.370> are<00:00:40.489> some<00:00:40.730> changes<00:00:40.940> by

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
but there are some changes by

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.259 
but there are some changes by
regulations<00:00:42.470> visually<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.640> can<00:00:43.670> see<00:00:44.059> that

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
regulations visually you can see that

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.450 
regulations visually you can see that
there<00:00:44.420> are<00:00:44.449> these<00:00:44.720> holes<00:00:45.019> over<00:00:45.470> all<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.339> the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
there are these holes over all of the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.610 
there are these holes over all of the
wheels<00:00:46.610> on<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.180> front<00:00:47.449> but<00:00:47.900> also<00:00:47.930> on<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.440> back

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
wheels on the front but also on the back

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.160 
wheels on the front but also on the back
we've<00:00:49.129> got<00:00:49.159> slightly<00:00:49.790> smaller<00:00:50.170> restrictors

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
we've got slightly smaller restrictors

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.410 
we've got slightly smaller restrictors
to<00:00:51.589> reduce<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.220> engine<00:00:52.519> power<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.000> turbo

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
to reduce the engine power and turbo

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.560 
to reduce the engine power and turbo
boost<00:00:53.629> pressures<00:00:54.049> as<00:00:54.229> well<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.909> finally<00:00:55.909> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.570 
TDI engine but the engine department
worked<00:01:11.630> very<00:01:11.930> hard<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.619> produce<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:13.100> faster

already<00:01:15.440> had<00:01:15.770> last<00:01:16.190> year<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.890> big

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
already had last year but the big

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.980 
already had last year but the big
difference<00:01:19.520> with<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.789> car<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.420> e-tron

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
difference with this car is the e-tron

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
now that is spinning about 45,000

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.060 
now that is spinning about 45,000
revolutions<00:01:38.600> per<00:01:38.689> minute<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.259> then<00:01:39.859> when<00:01:40.039> I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
revolutions per minute and then when I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770

come out of the shickens I press on the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.330 
come out of the shickens I press on the

throttle and that energy is
redistributed<00:01:43.899> through<00:01:44.899> these<00:01:45.049> motors<00:01:45.439> to

the front wheels which creates a Quattro
system<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:48.979> accelerate<00:01:49.670> off<00:01:49.880> down

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
system and then I accelerate off down

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.170

philosophy of ultra but that has been

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.020 
philosophy of ultra but that has been
taken<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.659> big<00:02:01.960> step<00:02:02.470> forward<00:02:02.770> with<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.610> e-tron

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
taken a big step forward with the e-tron
