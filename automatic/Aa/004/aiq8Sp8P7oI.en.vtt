00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.479
 what I actually don't need 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.969
 not everyone has his boiler or maybe not the right one how 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:16.929
 determine your report 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.789
 every boiler is suitable for you 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.310
 There are two types of viewers: the solo and the coming 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.220
 so runs there nevertheless ensures only the central heating 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.330
 at that time too 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.739
 also for a professional 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.739
 Allah starting with the expectation 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.289
 the chain must ensure a warm home 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.130
 and preferably naturally as cheaply as possible 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.040
 wilders optimal the efficiency you had to get the boiler the two choices de vrt 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.520
 in the hr boiler 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.350
 the first stands for improved returns and otherwise for high returns 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.870
 also the return the more because where a tent from the host country 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.480
 what you burn 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.390
 the purchase of the vrt or we are the top is almost the same 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.190
 so why should i choose to do vrt top out 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 every boiler has to do with combustion gases 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.770
 and these connections are skated away in winter because smokers can 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.570
 and there is just the difference between the vrt and the hr 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.280
 their hr boiler you have many containers and that will be disposed of 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.580
 that is not always possible then you choose 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 etc 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.730
 then you have to know that the capacity the boiler needs 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.300
 So feel the contents of your cup house very easily 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.310
 conquered with 70 bath 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.920
 then you have enough capacity 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.270
 the house top 20 steel 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 I have become a simple example 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.690
 apartment with the total capacity of for example 300 cubic meters 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 is 310 70 is a 20,000 baht 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.650
 or minimum power 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.100
 of the viewer must be 21 kd that is in good condition 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.400
 no less than a chain with slightly more capacity because that damages the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 lifetime of the boiler at singh 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.720
 then the hot water 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.200
 before you start purchasing, you must consider what you need hot water for 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.670
 have doms have you only used pad tim for the dishes or do you want to do it at the same time 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 can test and do the dishes 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.489
 before the turn-around found its way 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.809
 4 the levels 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.579
 we do not count the first two 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.399
 when make it 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.430
 in this overview one can see an eye store 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.430
 for example, which church supplies the chain with the c4 label for at least thirteen 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.909
 showed the benefits of 40 degrees Celsius per minute 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.599
 m 8 of 60 degrees so you can be very impressed by his rules 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.389
 but not finished at the same time 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.089
 we can't make it any more fun, but we can make it easier 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.939
 if you want to chain yourself was outside then watch the following video
