00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Step 1: Separate the top center hair with circular partying including the crown part.  Put it into a ponytail. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Step 2:  Divide the hair in the ponytail into two and clamp the top part. Also, clamp the hair on the right temple side. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Step 3: Pick up a strand from the loose hair under right temple hair that you clamped and divide it into two.  Pick a thin strand from the hair in ponytail and braid them together into a simple braid. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Step 4: Continue braiding a French braid but now with tiebacks, separating small strands from the ponytail and centrally loose hair underneath. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Step 5: Start using the clamped hair from the ponytail while braiding in hair from the left and front sides. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Step 6: Finish with a simple down hanging braid. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Step 7: Secure the braid with a rubber band. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:53.780
Step 8: Hide the tail of the braid inside the main braid and secure with hairpins.
