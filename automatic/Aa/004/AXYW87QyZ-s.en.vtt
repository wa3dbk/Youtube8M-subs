00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
eight seconds but even better what's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240 
eight seconds but even better what's
passively<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.649> increases

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
passively about it is that it increases

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
passively about it is that it increases
your<00:01:02.489> spellpower<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
your spellpower when it's not up and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.450 
your spellpower when it's not up and
it's<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> cooldown<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> increase<00:01:05.430> your

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's not on cooldown and increase your

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
it's not on cooldown and increase your
spell<00:01:05.820> powered<00:01:06.030> by<00:01:06.180> six<00:01:06.450> percent<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
spell powered by six percent and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
spell powered by six percent and
increases<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.619> mana<00:01:07.920> regeneration<00:01:08.100> by

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
increases your mana regeneration by

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.200 
increases your mana regeneration by
sixty-five<00:01:09.390> percent<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.909> believe

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
sixty-five percent so I really believe

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.710 
sixty-five percent so I really believe
that<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.780> strong<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.470> pvp<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.720> but

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that that's very strong for pvp and but

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
that that's very strong for pvp and but
keep<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.049> mind<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> passive<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.030> negated

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
keep in mind that the passive is negated

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480 
keep in mind that the passive is negated
whenever<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.810> cooldown<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> second

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
whenever it is on cooldown the second

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
whenever it is on cooldown the second
ability<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.939> called<00:01:20.970> invocation<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
ability is called invocation and this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
ability is called invocation and this
can<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> very<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.400> ability<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.000> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
can be a very good ability as well but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.679 
can be a very good ability as well but
more<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> PVE<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> believe<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
more for a PVE side I believe is that it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
more for a PVE side I believe is that it
reduces<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> cooldown<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.950> vocation<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> 10

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
reduces the cooldown of a vocation to 10

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
reduces the cooldown of a vocation to 10
seconds<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> very

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
seconds which is very I think it's very

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.210 
seconds which is very I think it's very
good<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.030> any<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> pv<00:01:34.110> pv<00:01:34.680> II<00:01:34.770> Men<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
good for any kind of pv pv II Men a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
good for any kind of pv pv II Men a
dumping<00:01:35.640> type<00:01:36.229> any<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> spec<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.130> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
dumping type any kind of spec like that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
dumping type any kind of spec like that
so<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.820> were<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.090> arcane<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.900> something

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so if you were like arcane or something

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
so if you were like arcane or something
relative<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.140> where<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
relative like that where you have to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.780 
relative like that where you have to
dump<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.040> mana<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.369> could<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> back

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
dump a lot of mana you could get it back

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300 
dump a lot of mana you could get it back
very<00:01:45.180> instantly<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> downside<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
very instantly but the downside of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.670 
very instantly but the downside of
amplification<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> passively

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
amplification is that it passively

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.020 
amplification is that it passively
decreases<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.890> mana<00:01:50.100> regeneration<00:01:50.280> by

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
decreases your mana regeneration by

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.469 
decreases your mana regeneration by
fifty<00:01:51.450> percent<00:01:51.979> but<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> bonus<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
fifty percent but also for a bonus is

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.530 
fifty percent but also for a bonus is
when<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> complete<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> full<00:01:55.969> vocation<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
when you complete a full vocation it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
when you complete a full vocation it
causes<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.049> deal<00:01:58.229> twenty-five<00:01:58.770> percent

fifteen percent and as you can see this

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.610 
fifteen percent and as you can see this
is<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.659> looks<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.959> when<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
is what it looks like when it is on the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.729 
is what it looks like when it is on the
ground<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.390> keep<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.569> note<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.439> can't

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
ground and keep a note that you can't

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.589 
ground and keep a note that you can't
put<00:02:34.980> two<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.519> ground<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.000> use<00:02:36.120> both<00:02:36.389> of

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
put two on the ground and use both of

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.449 
put two on the ground and use both of
them<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:37.049> like<00:02:37.170> double<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.620> amount<00:02:37.889> of<00:02:38.129> stats

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
them for like double the amount of stats

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.539 
them for like double the amount of stats
and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.719> feel<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.680> purely<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.219> PVE

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
and I feel like this is purely a PVE

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.339 
and I feel like this is purely a PVE
ability<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.359> mages<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.989> believe<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
ability for mages I don't believe that

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.039 
ability for mages I don't believe that
this<00:02:43.439> will<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.680> used<00:02:43.889> in<00:02:44.040> PvP<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:45.049> you

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
this will be used in PvP because you

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.420 
this will be used in PvP because you
always<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> move<00:02:46.889> in<00:02:47.040> PvP

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
always have to be on the move in PvP

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.059 
always have to be on the move in PvP
basically<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.150> can't<00:02:48.629> just<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.650> know<00:02:49.769> stay

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
basically you can't just you know stay

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.770 
basically you can't just you know stay
in<00:02:50.189> one<00:02:50.340> spot<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.639> use<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.030> extra<00:02:51.209> spa<00:02:51.419> damage

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
in one spot and use the extra spa damage

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.589 
in one spot and use the extra spa damage
like<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.079> can<00:02:52.290> or<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.549> are<00:02:53.819> able<00:02:54.419> to

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
like you can or like you are able to

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.210 
like you can or like you are able to
move<00:02:54.930> around<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.620> other<00:02:55.859> abilities<00:02:56.389> now<00:02:58.220> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
move around the other abilities now this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.819

ability<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.700> good<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.359> think<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.019> can<00:03:01.169> only<00:03:01.379> be
