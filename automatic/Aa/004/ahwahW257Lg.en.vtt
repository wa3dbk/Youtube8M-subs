off with screaming Bell give it a great

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
off with screaming Bell give it a great
shake<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> always<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:05.100> course<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.610> into

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
shake as always and of course put into

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.570 
shake as always and of course put into
our<00:01:05.909> palette<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.049> you'll<00:01:07.200> notice

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
our palette and as you'll notice

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.490 
our palette and as you'll notice
screaming<00:01:08.580> Bell<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> very<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.600> reddish

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
screaming Bell is a very very reddish

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.310 
screaming Bell is a very very reddish
metallic<00:01:11.400> color<00:01:11.729> obviously<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
metallic color obviously it's very I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.929 
metallic color obviously it's very I
know<00:01:13.470> copper<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> supposed<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.490> red<00:01:14.729> but

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
know copper is supposed to be red but

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.440 
know copper is supposed to be red but
this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.479> red<00:01:16.009> copper<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> we'll<00:01:18.360> add

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this is a very red copper so we'll add

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.670 
this is a very red copper so we'll add
it<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.659> our<00:01:18.810> palette<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it into our palette I'm just going a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
it into our palette I'm just going a
little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> thinner<00:01:20.490> medium<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
little bit of thinner medium to it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
little bit of thinner medium to it
I<00:01:21.780> recommend<00:01:22.500> thinning<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> metallics

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I recommend thinning down the metallics

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880 
I recommend thinning down the metallics
from<00:01:24.180> Games<00:01:24.360> Workshop<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.259> go

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
from Games Workshop because they do go

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.320 
from Games Workshop because they do go
on<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> little<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.610> clunky

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on a little bit clunky

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
on a little bit clunky
so<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.020> thinning<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.409> gets<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> nice

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so if thinning down gets a nice

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
so if thinning down gets a nice
consistency<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.880> I'll<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.329> thin<00:01:30.600> coats

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
consistency and I'll do two thin coats

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
consistency and I'll do two thin coats
as<00:01:31.079> opposed<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.189> thick<00:01:32.460> coat<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
as opposed to one really thick coat that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.399 
as opposed to one really thick coat that
way<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.150> keep<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> details<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> will

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
way we keep the details and it will

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
way we keep the details and it will
produce<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.890> nice<00:01:35.100> shine<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> end

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
produce a really nice shine in the end

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
produce a really nice shine in the end
anyway<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.829> give<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> great

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
anyway so we're gonna give it a great

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.910 
anyway so we're gonna give it a great
shake<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.900> great<00:01:39.900> stirring<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
shake is great stirring here just get a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
shake is great stirring here just get a
nice<00:01:41.159> consistency<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.200> don't<00:01:43.200> recommend<00:01:43.409> using

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
nice consistency I don't recommend using

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
nice consistency I don't recommend using
water<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.250> thin<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.790> metallics<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
water to thin down your metallics it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.990 
water to thin down your metallics it
really<00:01:45.750> does<00:01:45.899> mess<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.520> pigments<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.970> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
really does mess with the pigments so I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.249 
really does mess with the pigments so I
recommend<00:01:48.299> using<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.509> medium<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:48.990> possible

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
recommend using a medium when possible

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.170 
recommend using a medium when possible
to<00:01:49.710> thin<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.189> metallics<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.880> see

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to thin down your metallics as you see

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.060 
to thin down your metallics as you see
now<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.020> nice<00:01:52.170> thin<00:01:52.380> consistency<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
now we have a nice thin consistency and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.120 
now we have a nice thin consistency and
it's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.369> nice<00:01:53.549> red<00:01:54.030> coppery<00:01:55.020> tone<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.070> I'm

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's a very nice red coppery tone so I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's a very nice red coppery tone so I'm
gonna<00:01:56.250> take<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.610> pretty<00:01:57.060> large<00:01:57.299> brush<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
gonna take a pretty large brush and just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.640 
gonna take a pretty large brush and just
apply<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.369> mentor

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
apply it over the mentor

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.020 
apply it over the mentor
and<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.250> can<00:02:01.340> see<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.700> doesn't<00:02:01.940> go<00:02:02.000> on

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and as you can see it doesn't go on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.700 
and as you can see it doesn't go on
perfectly<00:02:02.510> with<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.780> single<00:02:03.080> coat<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.410> will<00:02:03.590> have

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
perfectly with a single coat I will have

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.770 
perfectly with a single coat I will have
to<00:02:03.800> do<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> secondary<00:02:04.580> coat<00:02:04.940> on<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.690> to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
to do a secondary coat on it just to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.050 
to do a secondary coat on it just to
make<00:02:05.990> sure<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.410> get<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> nice<00:02:07.060> complete

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
make sure that I get a nice complete

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.969 
make sure that I get a nice complete
coverage<00:02:08.540> of<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> model<00:02:09.380> before<00:02:09.470> proceeding

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
coverage of the model before proceeding

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.750 
coverage of the model before proceeding
to<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> shade<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:15.560> course<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.220> should<00:02:16.640> have

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to the shade and of course I should have

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760 
to the shade and of course I should have
mentioned<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.060> before<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.260> put<00:02:18.620> all

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
mentioned this before I like to put all

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.690 
mentioned this before I like to put all
my<00:02:18.950> metallics<00:02:19.730> over<00:02:20.150> black<00:02:20.740> primer<00:02:21.740> as<00:02:22.340> why<00:02:22.670> I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
my metallics over black primer as why I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.900 
my metallics over black primer as why I
primed<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.750> particular<00:02:24.020> model<00:02:24.320> black

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
primed this particular model black

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.460 
primed this particular model black
metallic<00:02:25.910> pigments<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.570> tend<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> sit<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
metallic pigments just tend to sit a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.670 
metallic pigments just tend to sit a
little<00:02:27.800> bit<00:02:27.920> better<00:02:28.160> over<00:02:29.080> darker<00:02:30.080> primed

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
little bit better over darker primed

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.230 
little bit better over darker primed
models<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.310> black<00:02:31.550> tends<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.910> be<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> best

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
models so black tends to be the best

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.900 
models so black tends to be the best
color<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.810> then<00:02:32.900> followed<00:02:33.200> by<00:02:33.320> a<00:02:33.350> gray<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:34.100> in

distant third white as he's going over

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.930

pretty<00:02:38.780> nicely<00:02:39.020> over<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.700> gonna<00:02:40.880> be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
pretty nicely over it and just gonna be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.490 
pretty nicely over it and just gonna be
a<00:02:41.000> complete<00:02:41.330> coverage<00:02:41.630> over<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> entire

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
secondary coat here's what the model

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.949 
secondary coat here's what the model
looks<00:03:10.819> like<00:03:10.970> as<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.209> can<00:03:11.360> see<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.659> very

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
looks like as you can see it's a very

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.580 
looks like as you can see it's a very
very<00:03:12.260> bright<00:03:12.829> red<00:03:13.370> metallic<00:03:13.939> copper<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:15.019> got

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
very bright red metallic copper I got

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.259 
very bright red metallic copper I got
some<00:03:15.739> great<00:03:15.920> coverage<00:03:16.250> over<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.610> just<00:03:17.060> said<00:03:17.239> I

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
some great coverage over I just said I

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.130 
some great coverage over I just said I
did<00:03:17.569> two<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.579> single<00:03:19.579> coats<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.599> two<00:03:20.959> thin

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
did two to single coats for it two thin

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.780 
did two to single coats for it two thin
coats<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.950> looks<00:03:22.099> great<00:03:22.310> but<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:22.549> we're<00:03:22.670> gonna

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
coats it looks great but now we're gonna

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.580 
coats it looks great but now we're gonna
make<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.510> look<00:03:23.629> slightly<00:03:23.900> older<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.470> then

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
make it look slightly older and then

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.530 
make it look slightly older and then
bring<00:03:24.890> back<00:03:25.099> up<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.310> metallics<00:03:25.849> as<00:03:26.000> we<00:03:26.150> go<00:03:26.299> so

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
bring back up the metallics as we go so

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.569 
bring back up the metallics as we go so
I<00:03:27.079> decided<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.590> Reckling<00:03:28.040> flesh<00:03:28.340> shade

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
I decided to use Reckling flesh shade

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.949 
I decided to use Reckling flesh shade
for<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.909> tutorial<00:03:29.329> because<00:03:29.390> regular<00:03:29.629> flesh

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
for this tutorial because regular flesh

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.199 
for this tutorial because regular flesh
it<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.260> actually<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> great<00:03:31.040> color<00:03:31.489> match<00:03:31.760> since

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
it is actually a great color match since

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.599 
it is actually a great color match since
it<00:03:32.359> has<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> lot<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.780> red<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.950> lot<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.280> brown

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
it has a lot of red and a lot of brown

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.690 
it has a lot of red and a lot of brown
in<00:03:34.879> it<00:03:35.109> it's<00:03:36.109> since<00:03:36.530> skin<00:03:37.190> tones<00:03:37.430> our

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
in it it's since skin tones our

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.030 
in it it's since skin tones our
combination<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.269> Browns<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.750> reds<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
combination of Browns and reds so it's a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580 
combination of Browns and reds so it's a
perfect<00:03:40.489> color<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:40.879> going<00:03:41.480> over<00:03:41.629> this

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
perfect color for going over this

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.740 
perfect color for going over this
particular<00:03:43.489> base<00:03:43.760> coat<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.420> lot<00:03:44.690> of

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
particular base coat I know a lot of

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.069 
particular base coat I know a lot of
people<00:03:44.930> use<00:03:45.079> blacks<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:46.329> like<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.510> oil<00:03:47.750> and

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
people use blacks and like not oil and

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.379 
people use blacks and like not oil and
they<00:03:48.859> use<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.159> growth<00:03:49.549> shape<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.939> decided<00:03:50.239> to

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
they use a growth shape I decided to

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.089 
they use a growth shape I decided to
regular<00:03:50.810> flesh<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.139> is<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> perfect<00:03:51.650> color<00:03:51.829> mix

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
regular flesh it is a perfect color mix

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.750 
regular flesh it is a perfect color mix
for<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.459> particular<00:03:52.939> one<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:54.560> course

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
for this particular one and of course

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.369 
for this particular one and of course
shades<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:55.970> general<00:03:56.359> will<00:03:56.569> then<00:03:56.840> produce<00:03:57.170> a

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
shades in general will then produce a

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.039 
shades in general will then produce a
very<00:03:57.620> matte<00:03:57.950> appearance<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.450> model<00:03:59.750> once

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
very matte appearance on the model once

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.229 
very matte appearance on the model once
it<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.230> finished<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.730> course<00:04:01.879> we're<00:04:02.180> gonna

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
it is finished so of course we're gonna

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.330 
are sitting I'm gonna try to build a
really<00:06:03.120> nice<00:06:03.360> quick<00:06:03.660> gradient<00:06:04.350> of<00:06:04.650> coppers

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
really nice quick gradient of coppers

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.060 
really nice quick gradient of coppers
over<00:06:05.760> this<00:06:05.880> model<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.810> way<00:06:07.020> it's<00:06:07.590> not<00:06:07.710> just<00:06:07.740> a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
over this model that way it's not just a

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.090 
over this model that way it's not just a
one-dimensional<00:06:08.520> color<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:10.350> basically

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
one-dimensional color and basically

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.410 
one-dimensional color and basically
it'll<00:06:11.280> mimic<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.730> light<00:06:11.880> source<00:06:12.120> hitting<00:06:12.360> as

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
it'll mimic the light source hitting as

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:20.120 
it'll mimic the light source hitting as
well<00:06:12.630> wherever<00:06:12.960> it<00:06:13.080> goes<00:06:18.170> as<00:06:19.170> you<00:06:19.710> see<00:06:19.890> and

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
well wherever it goes as you see and

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.770 
well wherever it goes as you see and
then<00:06:20.250> finally<00:06:20.610> just<00:06:20.640> with<00:06:21.150> hashtag<00:06:21.480> copper

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
then finally just with hashtag copper

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.020 
then finally just with hashtag copper
just<00:06:21.990> by<00:06:22.140> itself<00:06:22.470> and<00:06:22.980> this<00:06:23.640> part<00:06:23.820> I'm<00:06:23.910> only

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
just by itself and this part I'm only

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.580 
just by itself and this part I'm only
focusing<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.510> air<00:06:24.630> is<00:06:24.750> facing<00:06:25.110> completely

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
focusing the air is facing completely

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.620 
focusing the air is facing completely
vertically<00:06:26.130> up<00:06:26.280> so<00:06:27.210> just<00:06:27.330> once<00:06:27.480> again

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
vertically up so just once again

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.240 
vertically up so just once again
building<00:06:28.080> up<00:06:28.170> a<00:06:28.260> creek<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.680> quick<00:06:28.890> radiant

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
building up a creek the quick radiant

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.400 
building up a creek the quick radiant
this<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.490> a<00:06:29.520> very<00:06:29.790> very<00:06:30.030> light<00:06:30.360> dry<00:06:30.780> brush<00:06:31.080> and

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
this is a very very light dry brush and

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.950 
this is a very very light dry brush and
I<00:06:31.440> just<00:06:32.340> build<00:06:32.550> up<00:06:32.910> that<00:06:33.270> Gray's<00:06:33.510> a<00:06:33.690> little

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
I just build up that Gray's a little

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.390 
I just build up that Gray's a little
more<00:06:34.140> pick<00:06:34.380> up<00:06:34.500> on<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:34.680> edges<00:06:35.010> and<00:06:35.040> really

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
more pick up on the edges and really

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.160 
more pick up on the edges and really
make<00:06:35.580> them<00:06:35.790> pop<00:06:35.970> when<00:06:36.450> the<00:06:36.480> light<00:06:36.690> source<00:06:36.930> hits

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
make them pop when the light source hits

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.150 
make them pop when the light source hits
them<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:39.510> see<00:06:40.140> now<00:06:40.290> there's<00:06:40.470> a<00:06:40.560> really<00:06:41.010> nice

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
them and see now there's a really nice

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.270 
them and see now there's a really nice
shine<00:06:41.400> to<00:06:41.580> it<00:06:41.610> and<00:06:41.880> it<00:06:42.600> looks<00:06:42.750> really<00:06:42.930> good<00:06:43.280> and

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
shine to it and it looks really good and

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.650 
shine to it and it looks really good and
then<00:06:44.430> we'll<00:06:44.490> just<00:06:44.670> decide<00:06:44.910> to<00:06:45.030> finish<00:06:45.150> off<00:06:45.420> the

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
then we'll just decide to finish off the

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.600 
then we'll just decide to finish off the
a<00:06:46.110> very<00:06:46.650> light<00:06:46.800> dry<00:06:46.980> brush<00:06:47.190> over<00:06:47.490> these

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
a very light dry brush over these

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.340 
a very light dry brush over these
surfaces<00:06:50.390> producing<00:06:51.390> even<00:06:51.540> better<00:06:51.750> shine<00:06:52.020> and

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
surfaces producing even better shine and

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.800 
surfaces producing even better shine and
quite<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.620> nice<00:06:52.800> gradient<00:06:53.100> of<00:06:53.460> coppers<00:06:54.330> over

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
quite the nice gradient of coppers over

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:03.020 
quite the nice gradient of coppers over
the<00:06:54.900> model

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.689 

and<00:07:04.030> that's<00:07:04.449> it<00:07:04.659> so<00:07:04.870> now<00:07:05.229> you<00:07:05.349> have<00:07:05.740> a<00:07:05.770> copper

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
and that's it so now you have a copper

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.950 
and that's it so now you have a copper
painted<00:07:08.639> cafe<00:07:09.639> spring<00:07:09.969> and<00:07:10.300> is<00:07:10.599> it<00:07:10.750> such<00:07:10.930> a

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
painted cafe spring and is it such a

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.760 
painted cafe spring and is it such a
great<00:07:11.199> amount<00:07:11.949> of<00:07:12.629> gradient<00:07:13.629> of<00:07:13.719> colors<00:07:14.050> is<00:07:14.740> a

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
great amount of gradient of colors is a

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.920 
great amount of gradient of colors is a
variety<00:07:15.250> of<00:07:15.280> shades<00:07:15.580> of<00:07:15.819> copper<00:07:16.210> and<00:07:16.539> he<00:07:16.840> has

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:16.930 
variety of shades of copper and he has

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.450 
variety of shades of copper and he has
that<00:07:17.110> older<00:07:17.409> appearance<00:07:17.770> in<00:07:17.889> the<00:07:17.979> crevices<00:07:18.400> so

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
that older appearance in the crevices so

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.249 
that older appearance in the crevices so
he<00:07:18.879> actually<00:07:19.180> is<00:07:19.300> a<00:07:19.330> bit<00:07:19.689> of<00:07:19.780> more<00:07:19.930> an<00:07:20.020> aged

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:20.259 
he actually is a bit of more an aged

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.629 
he actually is a bit of more an aged
look<00:07:20.439> which<00:07:20.710> is<00:07:20.740> what<00:07:20.919> I<00:07:20.949> like<00:07:21.069> to<00:07:21.129> do<00:07:21.340> I'm

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
look which is what I like to do I'm

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.550 
look which is what I like to do I'm
painting<00:07:21.849> my<00:07:21.969> coppers<00:07:22.419> and<00:07:22.689> that's<00:07:23.229> it<00:07:23.439> it

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
painting my coppers and that's it it

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.320 
painting my coppers and that's it it
just<00:07:23.740> takes<00:07:23.889> a<00:07:23.979> few<00:07:24.009> steps<00:07:24.189> but<00:07:24.639> dry<00:07:25.000> brushing

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
just takes a few steps but dry brushing

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.149 
just takes a few steps but dry brushing
is<00:07:25.419> great<00:07:25.629> and<00:07:25.930> regular<00:07:26.710> pleasure<00:07:26.919> is<00:07:27.129> a

is great and regular pleasure is a
perfect<00:07:27.610> match<00:07:27.789> for<00:07:28.120> copper<00:07:28.930> I<00:07:28.960> do<00:07:29.110> find
