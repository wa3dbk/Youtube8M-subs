00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
zero now this doesn't work on every

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399 
zero now this doesn't work on every
device<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.790> found<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:46.079> completely

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
device I found that it just completely

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
device I found that it just completely
completely<00:01:46.770> doesn't<00:01:47.280> work<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> Nexus<00:01:48.030> 7<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
completely doesn't work the Nexus 7 it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
completely doesn't work the Nexus 7 it
doesn't<00:01:48.659> work<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.649> only<00:01:50.130> had<00:01:50.399> one

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
doesn't work with I've only had one

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.359 
doesn't work with I've only had one
device<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.390> works<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.380> hope<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
device this works with so just hope that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
device this works with so just hope that
it<00:01:53.490> works<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.119> remember<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> change

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it works if not just remember to change

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
it works if not just remember to change
this<00:01:55.140> back<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.619> zero<00:01:55.890> because<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> may<00:01:56.490> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this back to zero because it may just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
this back to zero because it may just
cause<00:01:57.420> bumps<00:01:57.899> instead<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
cause bumps instead so you're going to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999 
cause bumps instead so you're going to
delete<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.299> zero<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.930> replace<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
delete the zero and replace it with a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.969 
delete the zero and replace it with a
one<00:02:02.719> then<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:04.020> hit<00:02:04.250> save<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.979> will

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
one then you will hit save and that will

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.850 
one then you will hit save and that will
give<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> widescreen<00:02:08.970> eyes<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> launch

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
give you widescreen eyes when you launch

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.210 
give you widescreen eyes when you launch
your
