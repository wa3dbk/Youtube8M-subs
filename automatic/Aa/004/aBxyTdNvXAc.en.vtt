you're not really gonna have trillions
of<00:00:39.420> people<00:00:39.750> coming<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.680> place<00:00:40.950> like

every second so manual reload isn't
really<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> bad<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> works<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
really that bad the way it works is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
really that bad the way it works is
somebody<00:00:46.260> walks<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.950> and<00:01:01.430> it'll<00:01:02.430> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
somebody walks in here and it'll just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.950 
somebody walks in here and it'll just
keep<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.149> doing<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:05.060> yeah

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.410

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
and I'm getting a little bit of lag time

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
and I'm getting a little bit of lag time
set<00:01:14.870> day<00:01:19.000> yep<00:01:20.000> yep<00:01:20.390> they<00:01:20.750> break<00:01:21.080> everything

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
set day yep yep they break everything

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.380 
set day yep yep they break everything
break<00:01:21.770> okay<00:01:22.430> goodness<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.090> was<00:01:23.210> getting<00:01:23.360> a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
break okay goodness I was getting a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.940 
break okay goodness I was getting a
little<00:01:23.450> bit<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.690> lag<00:01:23.840> from<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.470> was

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
little bit of lag from that I was

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.100 
little bit of lag from that I was
getting<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.370> lot<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.610> lag<00:01:25.880> from<00:01:26.120> beforehand<00:01:26.900> I

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
getting a lot of lag from beforehand I

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.690 
getting a lot of lag from beforehand I
don't<00:01:27.290> know<00:01:27.380> why<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.620> gives<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.220> lot<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.460> lag

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
don't know why it gives you a lot of lag

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.610 
don't know why it gives you a lot of lag
it<00:01:29.030> might<00:01:29.300> give<00:01:29.510> everybody<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:30.080> lot<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.290> lag<00:01:30.440> or

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
it might give everybody a lot of lag or

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.440 
it might give everybody a lot of lag or
might<00:01:30.830> just<00:01:31.070> be<00:01:31.190> me<00:01:31.400> but<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:32.150> gonna<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.420> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
might just be me but it's gonna be a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.300 
might just be me but it's gonna be a
pretty<00:01:32.660> good<00:01:32.750> amount<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.290> lag<00:01:33.440> not<00:01:34.040> too<00:01:34.190> long

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
pretty good amount of lag not too long

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.670 
pretty good amount of lag not too long
ago<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:35.810> can't<00:01:36.050> really<00:01:36.170> control<00:01:36.470> but

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
ago and but I can't really control but

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.910 
ago and but I can't really control but
anyways<00:01:36.950> guys<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> way<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:37.490> works<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.970> um<00:01:38.920> it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
anyways guys the way it works is um it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.290 
anyways guys the way it works is um it
doesn't<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:40.250> matter<00:01:40.430> if<00:01:40.640> they<00:01:40.790> step<00:01:41.000> on<00:01:41.210> or

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
doesn't really matter if they step on or

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.030 
doesn't really matter if they step on or
if<00:01:41.390> they<00:01:41.510> break<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.900> without<00:01:42.080> shears<00:01:42.440> no

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
if they break it without shears no

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.830 
if they break it without shears no
matter<00:01:43.220> what<00:01:43.520> its<00:01:43.760> gonna<00:01:43.910> set<00:01:44.210> off<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.450> alarm

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
matter what its gonna set off this alarm

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.050 
matter what its gonna set off this alarm
and<00:01:45.170> what<00:01:45.500> happens<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.850> what<00:01:47.030> i

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and what happens is is this is what i

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.490 
and what happens is is this is what i
use<00:01:47.120> my<00:01:47.450> arrow<00:01:47.600> trap<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:48.380> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
use my arrow trap and this is just a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.410 
use my arrow trap and this is just a
normal<00:01:48.680> time<00:01:49.010> repeater<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.580> now<00:01:50.000> normally

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
normal time repeater and now normally

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.700 
normal time repeater and now normally
with<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> timer<00:01:50.810> Peter<00:01:51.080> if<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.260> just<00:01:51.470> sit<00:01:51.680> down

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
with a timer Peter if you just sit down

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.530 
with a timer Peter if you just sit down
there<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.550> can<00:01:52.729> load<00:01:53.120> up<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.330> whole<00:01:53.450> entire

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
there it can load up the whole entire

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.120 
there it can load up the whole entire
time<00:01:53.810> repeater<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.260> then<00:01:54.500> make<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:54.770> not<00:01:54.890> work

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
time repeater and then make it not work

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.120 
time repeater and then make it not work
anymore<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> what<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.380> did<00:01:57.470> was<00:01:57.620> as<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.100> said

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
anymore and so what I did was as I said

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.060 
anymore and so what I did was as I said
this<00:01:58.460> up<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.930> disconnects<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.740> every

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
this up so it disconnects this every

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.590 
this up so it disconnects this every
once<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> while<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> timer<00:02:02.120> Peter<00:02:02.390> can

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
once in a while so the timer Peter can

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.300 
once in a while so the timer Peter can
keep<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.900> going<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.410> there's<00:02:04.010> no<00:02:04.130> way<00:02:04.280> to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
keep on going and there's no way to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.070 
keep on going and there's no way to
block<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.760> up<00:02:04.850> or<00:02:05.000> mess<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.300> up<00:02:05.360> or<00:02:05.570> anything<00:02:05.660> so

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
block it up or mess it up or anything so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.840 
block it up or mess it up or anything so
it<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.320> works<00:02:06.470> out<00:02:06.620> perfectly<00:02:07.040> fine<00:02:07.250> now<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it just works out perfectly fine now the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.240 
it just works out perfectly fine now the
problem<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.350> stuck<00:02:09.860> up<00:02:10.070> so

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
problem is is this and get stuck up so

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
problem is is this and get stuck up so
that's<00:02:10.369> end<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.270> right<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.840> get<00:02:11.959> to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
that's end this right here you get to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.900 
that's end this right here you get to
break<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> block<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.160> could<00:02:13.400> switch<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.760> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
break a block or you could switch it to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.270 
break a block or you could switch it to
where<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.420> make<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.800> break<00:02:15.980> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
where you can make it you can break like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.030 
where you can make it you can break like
right<00:02:16.489> here<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:17.989> little<00:02:18.230> piston

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
right here and then have a little piston

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.590 
right here and then have a little piston
come<00:02:19.160> over<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.850> then<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.150> still<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.450> to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
come over but then you still have to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.590 
come over but then you still have to
worry<00:02:20.780> about<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.170> problem<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.209> I'm<00:02:23.209> not<00:02:23.450> too
