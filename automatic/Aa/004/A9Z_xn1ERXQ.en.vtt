00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
hello everyone this is the apex 180

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.999 
hello everyone this is the apex 180
microphone<00:00:19.240> test<00:00:19.539> I<00:00:19.869> am<00:00:20.380> talking<00:00:20.830> on<00:00:20.859> this

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
microphone test I am talking on this

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.450 
microphone test I am talking on this
microphone<00:00:21.340> right<00:00:21.730> now<00:00:21.759> so<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.980> is<00:00:24.160> what<00:00:24.340> it

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
microphone right now so this is what it

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.769 
microphone right now so this is what it
sounds<00:00:24.699> like<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:25.060> I'm<00:00:25.240> just<00:00:25.390> gonna<00:00:25.509> play<00:00:25.750> a

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
sounds like and I'm just gonna play a

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.409 
sounds like and I'm just gonna play a
little<00:00:26.020> bit<00:00:26.199> of<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.410> guitar<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:28.180> you<00:00:28.270> can

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
little bit of a guitar and so you can

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:59.330 
little bit of a guitar and so you can
hear<00:00:28.570> how<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.689> sounds

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.860 

okay<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.640> first<00:01:00.760> test<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:01.360> had<00:01:01.630> the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
okay so in the first test I had the

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.780 
okay so in the first test I had the
omnidirectional<00:01:02.410> tip<00:01:02.980> on<00:01:03.130> but<00:01:03.370> now<00:01:03.520> I<00:01:03.550> switch

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
omnidirectional tip on but now I switch

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.930 
omnidirectional tip on but now I switch
it<00:01:04.030> up<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> hyper-cardioid<00:01:05.080> tip<00:01:05.590> and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
it up to the hyper-cardioid tip and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:50.039 
it up to the hyper-cardioid tip and
we'll<00:01:06.940> see<00:01:07.090> how<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.240> sounds<00:01:07.540> in<00:01:07.810> comparison

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.630 

so<00:01:51.049> those<00:01:51.470> are<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.740> differences<00:01:52.070> between<00:01:52.400> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
so those are the differences between the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.950 
so those are the differences between the
two<00:01:52.790> tips<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.210> definitely<00:01:53.600> think<00:01:53.750> the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
two tips I definitely think the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.340 
two tips I definitely think the
hyper-cardioid<00:01:54.740> tip<00:01:55.310> definitely<00:01:56.299> has<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> much

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
hyper-cardioid tip definitely has a much

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
hyper-cardioid tip definitely has a much
brighter<00:01:57.710> clearer<00:01:58.549> sound<00:01:58.820> as<00:01:59.060> opposed<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.479> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
brighter clearer sound as opposed to the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.570 
brighter clearer sound as opposed to the
omnidirectional<00:01:59.990> which<00:02:00.560> catches<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.369> sound

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
omnidirectional which catches the sound

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.820 
omnidirectional which catches the sound
coming<00:02:01.790> off<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> walls<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.590> more<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
coming off the walls and more of the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.920 
coming off the walls and more of the
room<00:02:04.100> sound<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.880> opposed<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.540> directly

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
room sound as opposed to just directly

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.559 
room sound as opposed to just directly
what's<00:02:06.890> coming<00:02:07.159> from<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> source<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.119> those

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
what's coming from the source so those

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.719 
what's coming from the source so those
are<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> differences<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:10.250> hope<00:02:10.580> you

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
are the differences and I hope you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.239 
are the differences and I hope you
enjoyed<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.030> video
