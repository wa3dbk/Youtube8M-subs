00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
nature of our ultimate goal is to get

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.420 
nature of our ultimate goal is to get
perfection<00:05:14.140> we<00:05:15.140> feel<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:15.500> we<00:05:15.770> may<00:05:16.010> never

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
perfection we feel that we may never

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.120 
perfection we feel that we may never
really<00:05:16.820> get<00:05:17.060> there<00:05:17.360> but<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.140> process<00:05:18.680> itself

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
really get there but the process itself

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.280 
really get there but the process itself
brings<00:05:19.520> about<00:05:19.760> our<00:05:20.300> tremendous<00:05:20.480> changes<00:05:21.140> for
