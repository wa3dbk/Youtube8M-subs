00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
online single matches working our way up

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.980

something or it could be like a race to
Division<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.960> divisions<00:02:17.530> would

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
Division one I think the divisions would

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.970 
Division one I think the divisions would
be<00:02:18.370> more<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.940> focus<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.560> series<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
be more of a focus for the series it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.710 
be more of a focus for the series it
would<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.160> pretty<00:02:21.400> cool<00:02:21.520> it's<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.480> long

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
would be pretty cool it's a long

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.770 
would be pretty cool it's a long
seriousness<00:02:23.470> about<00:02:23.920> ten<00:02:24.310> divisions<00:02:24.780> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
seriousness about ten divisions it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.240 
seriousness about ten divisions it's
something<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.740> interest<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.160> you

like there could be different teams for

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.680 
like there could be different teams for
each<00:02:29.380> division<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:30.370> could<00:02:30.550> be<00:02:30.580> ways<00:02:31.450> to
