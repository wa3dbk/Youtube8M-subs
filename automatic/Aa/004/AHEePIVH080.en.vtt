00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 welcome on behalf of the assembly 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.000
 popular national of china the lord 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.150
 president of the popular assembly of the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 Chinese popular republic and distinct 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 members of it that today we 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.760
 grant the honor of receiving us and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 our positivity I must confess that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.330
 although I came as first 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.810
 president as president as incumbent 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.199
 of the executive power be next to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 members of what power represents 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.520
 of the people the legislative power of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.860
 town is for me too 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 a special reason because before being 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:51.190
 President, I was a provincial legislator 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:57.180
 first from 1989 to 1995 and then 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:02.290
 member of the national parliament since 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.989
 1995 until 2007 when I assumed as 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.110
 president of the republic so my 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.960
 greater performance in tasks 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.420
 institutional was not as president 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 but precisely as a legislator for 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.130
 so I feel almost between colleagues 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.590
 today this afternoon and I really want 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.770
 thank you for the warm welcome that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 they have dispensed us and also tell him something 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.490
 what does it have to do with 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.729
 do not 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.500
 strictly architectural what 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.610
 It also represents how I had to 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.950
 enter through an alternative place not 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.180
 I made for the place where it is commonly 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.250
 enter the town palace a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.170
 president who is down the stairway 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.759
 main but this allowed me to know 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.330
 the precincts of the popular assembly and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.880
 let me tell you, it's really something 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.880
 awesome and impressive
