00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
to think a little bit differently I mean

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.920 
to think a little bit differently I mean
we<00:02:32.190> wrote<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.819> about<00:02:33.090> life<00:02:33.360> than<00:02:33.390> death

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
we're pretty pretty happy with what

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.340 
we're pretty pretty happy with what
we've<00:02:41.940> gotten<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.329> thus<00:02:42.540> far<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.109> so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
we've gotten to do thus far and so

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
we've gotten to do thus far and so
that's<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> statement<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.420> song

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
