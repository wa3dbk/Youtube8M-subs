thought this was perfect it was $23 so
much<00:03:05.940> cheaper<00:03:06.360> than<00:03:06.660> if<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.829> were<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> buy<00:03:08.310> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
much cheaper than if you were to buy a

share<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.769> with<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.010> guys<00:03:32.069> again<00:03:32.519> they<00:03:33.359> have

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
share this with you guys again they have

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.180 
share this with you guys again they have
bigger<00:03:33.870> ones<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.290> these<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:34.889> actually

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
bigger ones of these I was actually

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.190 
bigger ones of these I was actually
debating<00:03:35.340> between<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.910> smaller<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
debating between the smaller and the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.629 
debating between the smaller and the
bigger<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:37.889> I'm<00:03:38.069> glad<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.280> went<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.609> a

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
bigger one but I'm glad I went with a

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.920 
bigger one but I'm glad I went with a
smaller<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.420> think<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.750> bigger

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
smaller one because I think the bigger

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.840 
smaller one because I think the bigger
one<00:03:40.139> would<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.380> been<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.530> giant<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.609> think

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
one would have been just giant I think

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.220 
one would have been just giant I think
it<00:03:41.970> was<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:43.410> tall<00:03:43.739> or<00:03:43.950> something<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
it was like this tall or something so

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.300 
it was like this tall or something so
hope<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.260> guys<00:03:46.350> enjoyed<00:03:46.739> let<00:03:46.980> me<00:03:47.040> know<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.220> you
