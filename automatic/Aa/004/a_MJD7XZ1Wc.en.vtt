00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.709
 A precisely calibrated thermometer is 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.430
 an essential tool to guarantee 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.310
 the safety and quality of food 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.170
 Automatic calibration function 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 patented by dead track facilitates the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.230
 calibration and eliminates the need for 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.300
 look at the thermometer to a laboratory 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.820
 this video shows how to use the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.850
 autocalibration function of your 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.850
 after- thermometer 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.089
 before starting, take a bath 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.820
 ice using a cup with crushed ice and 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.219
 cold water fill the glass up 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.859
 with crushed ice is important for 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.899
 get a stable temperature does not 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.940
 recommend the ice cubes since 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.799
 would cause more temperature readings 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.049
 tall 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.180
 I slowly added cold water to the 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.519
 water line that is approximately 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.940
 1.3 centimeters below the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.670
 ice surface an ice bath 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.490
 done correctly should always have 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.830
 to the ice touching the bottom of the cup and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.830
 not floating in the water 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.780
 gently stir the mixture using 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.630
 the thermometer probe that is 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 calibrating then leave the ice bath 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.830
 at rest for 2 minutes allowing 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.860
 that the temperature stabilize 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.960
 press the power button to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.930
 learn the thermometer and then place 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 the probe with the tip in the middle of the bath 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.570
 of ice at least five centimeters by 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.810
 below the surface I located the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.850
 cl button on the thermometer and stir 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 Gently in the center of the cup 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.120
 for 15 seconds while maintaining the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.850
 tip of the submerged probe and make sure 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.910
 Do not touch the sides with the part 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.720
 lower house press and hold 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.150
 pressed the button on it for about two 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.880
 seconds and release it when the word 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.450
 whether he appears blinking in the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.910
 screen the thermometer is now in the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.820
 automatic calibration mode and it will take 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.580
 the temperature readings until a 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.310
 stable group of three readings has been 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.700
 saved will be blocked at three 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.860
 readings and the screen will flash three 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 times a letter c in front of the numbers 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.530
 to complete the calibration process and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.050
 the thermometer will automatically return to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.200
 normal mode of operation 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.980
 now the screen should say 32 degrees 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.410
 fahrenheit or 0 degrees centigrade have 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.430
 note that it may be slightly 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.740
 above or below this reading 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.020
