 Achievements presented 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.940
 BlueMotion Technologies Inc are consumption-reducing developments such as 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:18.669
 For example, the start-stop system of the electric drive or the hybrid system well 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.500
 BlueMotion on Borussia Technologies has been expanded to "Reckless" daredevils 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500

 Valdivia towards emission reductions and also percent 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.850
 Benefit from low consumption percent and we want these technologies

 Technology is considered percent and lecturer that we want to use course 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.570
 to draw attention to us accordingly and percent something for the brand 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.500
 to do 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.540
 Attention gets VW certainly with the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.680
 it's his first hybrid vehicle 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.460
 Volkswagen will be the next generation of the Touareg in parallel with the pure 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.400
 Gasoline and diesel versions also bring as a hybrid version on the market 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 The nickel-metal hydride battery is space-saving in the area 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 the original spare wheel well 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.460
 7 67 kilograms and generates a voltage of 288 volts 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.940
 compared to a conventional one it played 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.860
 The hybrid concept in city traffic results in fuel savings 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.260
 of more than 25 percent 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.970
 The hybrid system enables driving with electric and combustion engines 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.940
 the highest performance requirements through, for example, a kickdown 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.439
 the electric motor additionally supports the combustion engine 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.280
 we present our hybrid technology today for the first time percent 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.460
 the public 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.030
 Percent we all have a hybrid where we have a dier 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.230
 machine combine with all of our EFSA percent and our key is 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.600
 the technology so direct injection percent car the technology provided com 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.400
 in the value of 2 who are very environmentally friendly technologies with each other that is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.549
 I percent processors for the first time percent of this 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 This technology is shown in total 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.419
 However, this version of the SUV needs a bit more maintenance

 as one hundred vehicles the less than one hundred 40 grams of co2 percent per 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.440
 Kilometers emit that makes us think I no other manufacturer on 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.200
 Overall, in% volume segment after and I think are a bit too 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.920
 To be proud of it, among these green fleets, is the new one
