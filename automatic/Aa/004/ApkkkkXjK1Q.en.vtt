00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.870 
after that after that knockdown round oh
well<00:01:39.320> even<00:01:39.560> before<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.950> like<00:01:40.340> before<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
well even before that like before that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.600 
well even before that like before that
round<00:01:41.119> he<00:01:41.390> got<00:01:41.570> hurt<00:01:41.840> before<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.950> round<00:01:43.159> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
round he got hurt before that round the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.010 
round he got hurt before that round the
only<00:01:43.820> run<00:01:44.030> where<00:01:44.210> he<00:01:44.270> did<00:01:44.420> pretty<00:01:44.570> well<00:01:44.689> was

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
only run where he did pretty well was

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.990 
only run where he did pretty well was
the<00:01:45.260> one<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.830> first<00:01:46.070> round<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.850> thought

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
the one of the first round so I thought

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.320 
the one of the first round so I thought
was<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.240> second<00:01:47.570> round<00:01:47.659> where<00:01:47.869> he<00:01:47.990> won<00:01:49.330> but

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
was the second round where he won but

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.060 
was the second round where he won but
even<00:01:50.570> those<00:01:50.720> were<00:01:50.900> those<00:01:51.200> those<00:01:51.590> were<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.920> two

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
even those were those those were the two

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.920 
even those were those those were the two
rounds<00:01:52.400> where<00:01:52.580> Gennady<00:01:53.000> golovkin<00:01:53.180> was<00:01:53.689> pretty

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
rounds where Gennady golovkin was pretty

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.469 
rounds where Gennady golovkin was pretty

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
chin not not in the chin but I believe

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.510 
chin not not in the chin but I believe
it<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.110> his<00:02:18.290> temper<00:02:18.680> area<00:02:18.950> where<00:02:19.190> he<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.400> able

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
it was his temper area where he was able

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.550 
it was his temper area where he was able
to<00:02:19.700> land<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.000> clean<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.480> Martha<00:02:21.200> Mary<00:02:21.319> went

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
to land it clean and Martha Mary went

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
to land it clean and Martha Mary went
down<00:02:21.770> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
down and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.700 
down and
at<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:22.940> point<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.360> thought<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.810> ref<00:02:24.020> or<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
at that point I thought the ref or the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.730 
at that point I thought the ref or the
corner<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:26.170> Martin<00:02:27.170> Murray<00:02:27.350> should<00:02:27.620> have

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
corner of Martin Murray should have

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.470 
corner of Martin Murray should have
stopped<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.220> fight<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.670> they<00:02:28.850> wanted<00:02:29.210> him<00:02:29.270> to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
stopped the fight but they wanted him to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
stopped the fight but they wanted him to
continue<00:02:29.780> they<00:02:30.110> wanted<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.530> believed<00:02:31.160> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
continue they wanted they believed that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.200 
continue they wanted they believed that
he<00:02:31.490> could<00:02:31.520> pull<00:02:31.880> off<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.180> upset<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:33.370> Manny<00:02:34.370> he

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
he could pull off the upset but Manny he

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.400 
he could pull off the upset but Manny he
didn't<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.750> much<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.170> mean<00:02:36.260> he's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
didn't really have that much I mean he's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.230 
didn't really have that much I mean he's
a<00:02:36.440> tough<00:02:36.710> dude<00:02:36.740> Martin<00:02:37.490> merits<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.820> tough<00:02:38.030> dude

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
a tough dude Martin merits a tough dude

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.090 
a tough dude Martin merits a tough dude
that's<00:02:38.510> why<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.960> said<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.740> fight<00:02:39.980> is

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
that's why I said that this fight is

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.380 
that's why I said that this fight is
going<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.370> distance<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.880> fight<00:02:41.120> could<00:02:41.270> have

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
going to distance this fight could have

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.750 
going to distance this fight could have
easily<00:02:41.510> gone<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.960> distance<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:43.280> got<00:02:43.730> to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
easily gone the distance but you got to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.490 
easily gone the distance but you got to
protect<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.270> fighter<00:02:44.510> he<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:44.930> taking<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> hell

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
out of beating even though he could take

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100 
out of beating even though he could take
the<00:02:49.430> punishment<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:50.870> want

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
the punishment you just you don't want

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.990 
the punishment you just you don't want
him<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> take<00:02:51.410> unnecessary<00:02:51.920> punishment<00:02:52.880> and
