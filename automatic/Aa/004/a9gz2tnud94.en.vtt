00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 what exactly in this video I explain 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 you as the whole with the muscle building 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.730
 at all works and show you so 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.219
 the most basic things you do 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.630
 you have to take care of your muscles 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.650
 to build up 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.650
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.520
 so people i hope you can read this 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.340
 yes , unfortunately , I only have one here 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.980
 green stands i just show you now 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.559
 like the most basic things 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.750
 can build on muscle or how 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.970
 the whole thing works at all 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.500
 your training and nutrition are what 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.500
 today our two things about us 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.090
 logically speaking and yes I start 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.860
 now just with nutrition we 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.690
 have a daily need in the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.970
 calories a day needs 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.820
 For me it is now so for example 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.190
 the 2600 calories speak this 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.829
 calorie count consumes my body 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.360
 really every day the belly this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.850
 calorie consumption of the body to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.130
 The organs need it to be around 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.009
 move is that he so that is the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.740
 daily requirement of calories my body 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.380
 needed per day 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 These are 2006 100 is calorie with me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.649
 this is something else with you 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.990
 you just calculate 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.380
 That depends on size weight of age 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 sex and yes it depends on it 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.740
 that's what you expect from here 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.410
 you calculate the daily requirement, so to speak 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.420
 calories yes that's really what 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.110
 would have to do now to build muscle 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.509
 to be able to 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.619
 You have to have a calorie surplus 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.330
 have indeed needs you have your then 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.090
 Here now you have naturally more 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.729
 So energy more calories to you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.740
 take as you needed during the day 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.750
 to build muscle 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.149
 I see the whole thing as building blocks 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.330
 So my body needs those calories 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.640
 from 2,600 year for the day and now 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.319
 I'm assuming the calorie surplus 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.479
 me what my body actually not 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.369
 needed and calories with this 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.230
 surplus that, as it were, as 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.750
 building blocks and with that I build mine 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.900
 Muscles on when you have no calories 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.090
 You can also have surplus 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.940
 do not build muscle yes because of the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 body so to speak have no construction site so 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.920
 I like to see that 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.010
 which with which yes simply must 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.690
 nature can build those are the two 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.849
 Points 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.220
 Of course, the next one is then 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.550
 right marco distribution marco 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.959
 Nutrients are carbohydrate proteins 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 and fat ones 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.950
 besides, I do not even go now 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.540
 will come up with their own video 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.790
 Every case is always very important 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.580
 carbohydrates that's it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.620
 most important in the construction of such a 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.560
 mediocre and fat you can be quiet 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.200
 keep something low so about 1 gram per 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.819
 kilo body weight 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 that is the nutrition yes that is 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.010
 you just look in summary 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.650
 let's see that you have your daily requirement 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.269
 calculated and then in calories 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.459
 to take over you 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 that means you have to use more energy 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.280
 lead you as you needed the day yes 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.290
 because then you have energy, so to speak 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.160
 plus and thus could the muscles 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.489
 build up 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.150
 in calories surplus from 300 to 500 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.590
 calorie 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.100
 Now my pen fell off 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.859
 I think that's perfect because if you want more 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.930
 one builds oneself only unnecessarily one man 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.370
 can also have a surplus of 200 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.500
 then abdominal muscles 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.790
 but maybe the whole year is over 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.549
 a little too slow 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.459
 that means 300 to 500 calories for 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.500
 me personally perfect 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.910
 what the nutrition to that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.470
 basic as ever 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.359
 can build muscle 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.769
 with the calorie surplus and so people 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.430
 Now we come to the training 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.739
 I hope you can read the first one 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.769
 point and on the second it is probably about 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.290
 the installation how to build muscle 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.440
 one must of course have the muscle 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.930
 already given 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.359
 you have to be the attraction you get in training 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.840
 the muscle during the training before 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.269
 increase training yes that is very important 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 the whole thing is down here progression 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.870
 which means that if I last 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.669
 training bench press say 70 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.620
 kilo and I have the 10 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.360
 times I have to go in 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.050
 next training a new attraction 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.419
 put 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.949
 that means I had to have more 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.340
 sheep as the last time 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:45.990
 Either I make the 70 kilo 11 12 x 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.240
 or I already take 72 5 kilo or 75 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.639
 I have a new muscle for years 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.669
 This is very important 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.169
 because you just have to muscle one 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.880
 give reason to grow 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.419
 and if you go with me every time now 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.760
 white light 70 kg bench press does that 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.340
 always ten times why should the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.620
 Muscles grow when he gets the 70 kilos eh 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.479
 already done ten times worry yes 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.430
 that's why you have to muscle one 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.889
 give reason to grow and managed to 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.570
 70 kilos eleven times and in the next plans 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.270
 They did it twelve times and in the 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.270
 After that you train 72 kilo 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.660
 do 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.169
 in the next life you take 72 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.000
 over 75 years that is 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.630
 you have to give the muscle a reason 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.820
 to grow 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.620
 you just have to increase the stimuli around 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.720
 that's called profession 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.919
 you just have to go to the 1 opposite 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.070
 increase benefits 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.770
 that is extremely important so could the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.960
 Muscles on and that's the best way 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.820
 so to say I recommend you there 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.539
 lead training book that's really 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.639
 to write everything down because you can 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.320
 It's not really every sentence 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.630
 and to remember every repetition 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.780
 and that's exactly what I write 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.300
 also made the 70 kilo ten times in the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.070
 next training looks for something 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.560
 last time 18 team today i have to 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.849
 eleven times already eleven times 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.430
 I've got my new muscles 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.229
 when put with the calorie surplus 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.160
 Nutrition Not Musculature 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.770
 build up 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.169
 in the next frame chance after that I have 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.650
 70 is already done eleven times okay 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.200
 today I take already 72 5 kg what me 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.300
 quite casual progression just the 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.010
 Muscle always give a new stimulus 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.640
 either as I said by more 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.289
 repetitions or by more weight 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.380
 that is the principle of the training yes 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.000
 always give the muscles and stimulus and that 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.039
 Principle of nutrition is with the 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.890
 right macro nutrients 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.690
 I still in another video 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.090
 to drive a calorie surplus 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.400
 which means more energy to become 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.490
 Take it as the body needs it 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.890
 simply building material building blocks has, so to speak 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.430
 with which you then build muscle 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.590
 can 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.419
 These are the two basic things 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.520
 for muscle building training and 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.070
 Nutrition that builds muscle 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.409
 People, of course, still liked to belong 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.150
 many other things about supplemente 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.050
 this is the but that's for the 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.219
 basic and you should do that 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.930
 Pay attention and implement in any case 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.550
 as I said when you do not 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.979
 if you never improve in the 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.050
 training if you put new stimuli if 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.030
 one has no calorie surplus then 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.710
 I honestly can not say you 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.110
 build muscle 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.400
 yes then you will be easy in the long run 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.400
 have no successes 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.370
 that means the expensive calories look like 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.440
 many take to you write for the 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.919
 training bookloe writes down what you do 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.390
 how often creates so can assure that 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:45.450
 They really build good muscles 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.370
 can and yes I hope the video has it 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.990
 please people if you have questions 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.360
 Write it in the comments 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.190
 Subscribe my channel give me thumbs 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.050
 high if I liked that 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.050
 Wish you had a nice day
