level<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> lot<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> stuff<00:01:56.340> i<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.670> only<00:01:56.820> able

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
level up a lot of stuff i was only able

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
level up a lot of stuff i was only able
to<00:01:57.090> evolve<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.479> few<00:01:57.719> things<00:01:57.899> mainly<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.530> i

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to evolve a few things mainly because i

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.780 
to evolve a few things mainly because i
needed<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.240> i<00:02:00.799> needed<00:02:01.799> evolution<00:02:02.340> materials

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
needed to i needed evolution materials

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
needed to i needed evolution materials
and<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> needed<00:02:03.180> totems<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.689> stuff<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and I needed totems and stuff and I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.380 
and I needed totems and stuff and I
wasn't<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.710> getting<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.700> let<00:02:06.149> me<00:02:06.180> cut

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
wasn't end up getting that so let me cut

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.969 
wasn't end up getting that so let me cut
the<00:02:06.509> rest<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.869> fusion<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the rest of this fusion out so it's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
the rest of this fusion out so it's
actually<00:02:08.039> able<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> condense<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> good<00:02:09.300> bit

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
actually able to condense this good bit

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
actually able to condense this good bit
i<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.629> able<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> cut<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.110> roughly<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.709> two

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
i was able to cut out roughly like two

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.860 
i was able to cut out roughly like two
minutes<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.489> fusion<00:02:11.940> junk<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.629> didn't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
minutes of fusion junk that we didn't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.970 
minutes of fusion junk that we didn't
need<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> see<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
need to see so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
need to see so
oh<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.610> awesome<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.840> actually<00:02:16.110> helped

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
oh that's awesome that actually helped

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.979 
oh that's awesome that actually helped
out<00:02:16.409> quite<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.670> um<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.569> actually<00:02:18.599> like

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
out quite a bit so um we actually like

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.740 
out quite a bit so um we actually like
in<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> few<00:02:19.440> pots<00:02:19.709> surprisingly<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.209> think

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
in a few pots surprisingly I don't think

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.839 
in a few pots surprisingly I don't think
I<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.019> any<00:02:22.230> idols<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.010> don't<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.519> get<00:02:23.670> any

idols at all it's literally just all
imps<00:02:26.819> basically<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:27.420> crazy<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.739> imps

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
imps basically it's crazy it's all imps

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.869 
imps basically it's crazy it's all imps
burst<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.819> crystals<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.930> gods<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.879> wasn't

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
burst and crystals and gods so wasn't

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.670 
burst and crystals and gods so wasn't
too<00:02:33.299> many<00:02:33.660> crystals<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.170> mean<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.379> was<00:02:34.440> still<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
too many crystals I mean it was still a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.680 
too many crystals I mean it was still a
good<00:02:34.709> amount<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.400> wasn't<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.849> an<00:02:36.150> insane

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
good amount but it wasn't like an insane

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.839 
good amount but it wasn't like an insane
amount<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.080> crystals<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.160> birds<00:02:38.370> frogs<00:02:38.610> is

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
amount of crystals the birds frogs is

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.440 
amount of crystals the birds frogs is
extremely<00:02:39.360> useful<00:02:39.510> considering<00:02:40.170> i<00:02:40.290> had<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
extremely useful considering i had to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.309 
extremely useful considering i had to
until<00:02:42.450> i<00:02:42.480> started<00:02:42.750> doing<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.230> actually

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
until i started doing this and actually

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.460 
until i started doing this and actually
i<00:02:43.470> used<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> two<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.599> someone<00:02:45.599> who<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.319> it

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
i used the two on someone who was it

name<00:03:00.209> correctly<00:03:00.989> enough<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> figure<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> out

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
name correctly enough to figure it out

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.130 
name correctly enough to figure it out
the<00:03:02.670> fire<00:03:02.940> mitigation<00:03:03.150> guy<00:03:03.569> anyways<00:03:03.900> i<00:03:04.019> got

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the fire mitigation guy anyways i got

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.650 
the fire mitigation guy anyways i got
his<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.379> there<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.040> oracle<00:03:05.370> though<00:03:05.629> but<00:03:06.629> i

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
his is there it was oracle though but i

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.830 
his is there it was oracle though but i
think<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.849> i'm<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.180> ping<00:03:09.359> him<00:03:09.569> and
