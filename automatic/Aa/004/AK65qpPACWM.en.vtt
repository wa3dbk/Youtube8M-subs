how to build and the part locations for
the<00:00:49.680> Maxis<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.130> earn<00:00:50.400> so<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.120> first<00:00:51.390> part<00:00:51.630> is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
the Maxis to earn so the first part is

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.160 
the Maxis to earn so the first part is
located<00:00:53.059> generate<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.390> down<00:00:54.720> these<00:00:54.900> stairs

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
located generate a one down these stairs

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.140 
located generate a one down these stairs
into<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> left<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.190> Max's<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> bread

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
into the left and it is Max's is bread

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.360

so<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> part<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.230> always<00:00:58.470> here<00:00:58.860> regardless

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so this part is always here regardless

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
so this part is always here regardless
no<00:00:59.850> matter<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> second<00:01:01.350> part<00:01:01.470> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
no matter what so the second part is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.850 
no matter what so the second part is
gonna<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.640> rotary<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.660> main<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.739> what

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
gonna be the rotary the main thing what

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
gonna be the rotary the main thing what
makes<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.190> fly<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> pack<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> punch

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
makes it fly and this is a pack of punch

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
makes it fly and this is a pack of punch
which<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.260> exhibition<00:01:07.560> site<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.610> should

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
which is the exhibition site you should

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.950 
which is the exhibition site you should
want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.910> go<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.660> just<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
want to go in there and you just want to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
want to go in there and you just want to
turn<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.380> hard<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.430> should<00:01:11.580> be

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
turn a hard right and it should be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
turn a hard right and it should be
against<00:01:11.910> this<00:01:12.060> wall<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.170> two<00:01:13.410> more

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
against this wall but this has two more

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.139 
against this wall but this has two more
locations<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> I'll<00:01:14.550> show<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.759> one<00:01:14.970> right

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
locations and I'll show you one right

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.300 
locations and I'll show you one right
now<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.990> second<00:01:16.350> location<00:01:16.470> could<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
now so the second location could be just

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
now so the second location could be just
down<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> pack-a-punch<00:01:18.030> stairs<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
down the pack-a-punch stairs and if you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
down the pack-a-punch stairs and if you
follow<00:01:19.740> these<00:01:19.979> stairs<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.030> around

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
follow these stairs all the way around

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.540 
follow these stairs all the way around
and<00:01:22.259> carry<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> way<00:01:23.130> you'll

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
and carry on going all the way you'll

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.840 
and carry on going all the way you'll
see<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:24.440> two<00:01:25.440> light<00:01:25.950> squares<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> should

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
see two two light squares and it should

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
see two two light squares and it should
be<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.149> against<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.780> square<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.920> it's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
be just against that square if not it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
be just against that square if not it's
even<00:01:29.430> further<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.050> third<00:01:31.320> part

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
even further down so for the third part

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.529 
even further down so for the third part
is<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.539> body<00:01:33.539> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.619> actual<00:01:35.130> drone<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.149> this

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
is the body of the actual drone and this

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.590 
is the body of the actual drone and this
should<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.979> generator<00:01:37.979> 6<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.509> all

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
should be a generator 6 but don't go all

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.150

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
the way to generator 6 it should be to

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.540 
the way to generator 6 it should be to
the<00:01:41.250> left<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:41.670> sad<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.630> listen<00:01:42.840> off<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.550> to

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
the left I'm sad don't listen off and to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.460 
the left hand side again near this light
little<00:01:46.440> small<00:01:46.770> generator<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:48.959> second

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
little small generator so the second

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.559 
little small generator so the second
place<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.009> part<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> tank

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
place this part can be is where the tank

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.359 
place this part can be is where the tank
is<00:01:51.810> where<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.319> tank<00:01:52.470> starts<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.160> keep

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
is where the tank starts just keep

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
is where the tank starts just keep
running<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.850> no-man's<00:01:54.209> land<00:01:54.360> until<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.319> hit

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
running to no-man's land until you hit

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
running to no-man's land until you hit
this<00:01:55.770> black<00:01:56.099> sand<00:01:56.580> into<00:01:56.910> puddles<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.720> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
this black sand into puddles and it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
this black sand into puddles and it
should<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.170> left<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:58.950> black<00:01:59.280> sand

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
should be just left of this black sand

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.800 
should be just left of this black sand
I<00:01:59.910> mean<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:01.319> be<00:02:01.440> fair<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.459> like<00:02:03.390> 90

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I mean to be fair I think this like 90

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
I mean to be fair I think this like 90
now<00:02:03.929> point<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.349> percent<00:02:04.800> this<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.429> only

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
now point now percent this is the only

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
now point now percent this is the only
places<00:02:06.179> these<00:02:06.479> parts<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.959> be<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.590> once

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
places these parts can be but once

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.990 
places these parts can be but once
you've<00:02:07.920> finished<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.880> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you've finished it you just want to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.650 
you've finished it you just want to
build<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:10.310> Quadra<00:02:11.310> arm<00:02:11.849> access<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
build your Quadra arm access to and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.360
