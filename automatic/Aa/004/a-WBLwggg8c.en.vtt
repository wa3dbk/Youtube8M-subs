continue to press the left mouse or

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.810 
continue to press the left mouse or

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
whatever in order to do combo so it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.160 
whatever in order to do combo so it
actually<00:02:02.460> reminds<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.750> dynasty

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
actually reminds me of the dynasty

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
actually reminds me of the dynasty
warrior<00:02:04.710> style<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.369> doing

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
warrior style of doing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that style I like the combo system i

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.210 
that style I like the combo system i
like<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.900> don't<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.260> Auto<00:02:28.590> attacks

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
like that you don't have Auto attacks

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.210 
like that you don't have Auto attacks
and<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.320> good<00:02:31.650> effort<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and that is really a good effort of the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.130 
and that is really a good effort of the
game<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:33.150> me<00:02:33.270> interested<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> first

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
game that got me interested in the first

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.199 
game that got me interested in the first
place<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.770> long<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.190> saw<00:02:35.400> some<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
place as long as I saw some of the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.240 
place as long as I saw some of the
previews<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.290> also<00:02:37.500> how<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.740> gain<00:02:37.950> function

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
previews and also how they gain function

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.400 
previews and also how they gain function
I<00:02:38.670> would<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.630> know<00:02:39.810> what<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> think

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I would like you know what I think

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.949 
I would like you know what I think
that's<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.700> MMO<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.360> me<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.750> I

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
that's going to be the MMO for me so I

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.550 
that's going to be the MMO for me so I
really<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.459> style<00:02:45.140> as<00:02:46.140> far<00:02:46.380> as

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
really like that style as far as

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.760 
really like that style as far as
leveling<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.900> played<00:02:49.200> Final

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
leveling up if you all have played Final

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.420 
leveling up if you all have played Final
Fantasy<00:02:49.920> 10<00:02:50.610> there<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> node<00:02:51.870> system<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Fantasy 10 there is a node system so

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.979 
Fantasy 10 there is a node system so
there<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> really<00:02:54.900> big<00:02:55.080> node<00:02:56.720> expansion<00:02:57.720> and

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
there is a really big node expansion and

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.550 
there is a really big node expansion and
as<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.310> level<00:02:59.610> up<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.480> these<00:03:00.959> little

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
as you level up and get these little

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220 
as you level up and get these little
gems<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> green<00:03:02.580> blue<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.230> oranges

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
gems you have a green blue and oranges

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.820 
gems you have a green blue and oranges
red<00:03:04.739> gems<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.510> level<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.530> can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
red gems and so if you level up you can

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.039 
red gems and so if you level up you can
pick<00:03:08.550> whatever<00:03:08.820> know<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.540> want<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
pick whatever know that you want and

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.780 
pick whatever know that you want and
then<00:03:10.080> continue<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.610> how<00:03:11.760> you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
then continue on and that is how you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.820 
then continue on and that is how you
gain<00:03:12.150> your<00:03:12.180> abilities<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.930> your<00:03:13.019> moves<00:03:13.290> but

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
gain your abilities and your moves but

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.310 
gain your abilities and your moves but
there<00:03:13.980> aren't<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.519> levels<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:16.260> game

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
there aren't really levels in this game

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.340 
there aren't really levels in this game
so<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.850> for<00:03:18.060> right<00:03:18.209> now<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.690> I'm<00:03:18.900> not<00:03:19.110> a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
so that's for right now like I'm not a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.130 
so that's for right now like I'm not a
rank<00:03:19.860> 10<00:03:20.519> or<00:03:20.820> whatever<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.750> see<00:03:21.930> at<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
rank 10 or whatever if you see at the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.800 
rank 10 or whatever if you see at the
bottom<00:03:22.290> left<00:03:22.620> hand<00:03:22.680> corner<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.850> has<00:03:24.239> my

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
bottom left hand corner that has my

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.759 
bottom left hand corner that has my
power<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.799> it's<00:03:26.130> my<00:03:26.250> power<00:03:26.670> ring<00:03:27.380> but<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.620> is

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
power so it's my power ring but that is

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.870 
power so it's my power ring but that is
the<00:03:28.799> way<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.310> level<00:03:29.610> up<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:30.019> Skyforge<00:03:31.019> as

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
the way that you level up in Skyforge as

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.479 
the way that you level up in Skyforge as
far<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.360> mission<00:03:33.750> structure<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:35.250> now

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
far as the mission structure right now

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.569 
far as the mission structure right now
you<00:03:35.549> have<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.600> hub<00:03:37.049> world<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
you have like a hub world and then you

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.300 
you have like a hub world and then you
can<00:03:38.760> go<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.209> different<00:03:39.660> missions<00:03:40.019> they<00:03:41.010> have

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
can go on different missions they have

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.120

some<00:03:41.700> areas<00:03:41.970> which<00:03:42.390> are<00:03:42.630> really<00:03:43.200> big<00:03:43.620> areas

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
some areas which are really big areas

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.890 
some areas which are really big areas
and<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:45.090> various<00:03:45.480> missions

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
within their with anyone and then you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.420 
within their with anyone and then you
have<00:03:49.019> special<00:03:49.590> places<00:03:49.799> where<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.280> go
