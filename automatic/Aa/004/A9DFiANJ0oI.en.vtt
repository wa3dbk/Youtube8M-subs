00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.920
 engine must get going 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.670
 I say names that are short sprints 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.000
 that is it is always where you 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.280
 we must be in training if you like 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.280
 footballer I think I can do runners 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.780
 go do it on your and on your vacation 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 but yes it is never really the same 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.470
 a few dots tomorrow tomorrow 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.330
 hopefully then it's Thursday 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.400
 good again let's just think so 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.870
 is so that I can again and again that I 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.680
 may and that is it for me 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.130
 most important thing 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.030
 and now the intention is and hopefully 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.730
 I just stay fit now and that is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.470
 that is a bit the the thing that i need 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.880
 take care of this season 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.739
 stay around and and many can 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.840
 that they are most important to football 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.200
 start this season 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 years with a fresh face would 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.750
 you just say empty head and and with a 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.759
 with one in many areas now also something 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.840
 10 I think you fan them everything looks one 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.970
 a bit fresh now I think 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.140
 from the group and that is that is 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.509
 of course what you would like to see on the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 training and even though you play that 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.070
 you make yourself better by the by the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.460
 rest of me the player is not it 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 is very good 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.620
 he had a very nice season 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.360
 where everything worked out you have a season 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.900
 it was a bit difficult that went 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.040
 you 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.050
 was fighting yourself 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.460
 then comes the long season with 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.050
 injuries 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.110
 a whole new feature is the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.370
 considering this season you think no I think 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.320
 I don't think so, I hope so 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.900
 not i always want to try myself too 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.490
 and and of the errors of the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.229
 learn the mistakes I made 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.030
 in also from van 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.340
 of the times I am down 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.050
 just come back on top that is 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 it that is the most important thing that i like that 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.869
 i hope to lick in and a few things or 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.880
 have learned and learned several 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.080
 Then then I hope it's just one 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.820
 and 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 will say in improved fichiers 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.470
 that that would be nice I now have a whole 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.150
 years and and and a good one too, I hope now 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.410
 a few good roads from the van 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
 preparation to 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.130
 to get back to that now at that level 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.530
 coming for the next season so me 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.540
 I looked confident and over and over 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 this team of many rely on which 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.530
 position you go aim this season for you 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.810
 was left winger at the end of last season 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.120
 saw you at the point of attack on 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.370
 which position do you aim the most 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.380
 no I think on the left winger that's that 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.840
 my feeling tells me and that is what I want 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.630
 gladly but if I when I rush you 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.060
 comes once or or in ten 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.010
 I also think that's fine, that's what I have 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 more often said those are all positions 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.390
 that you must be able to enter as if 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.620
 attacks but i think i'm thinking about that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.110
 to start just on the on the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.420
 left winger to think that all of 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.860
 and why do you hope so I don't know 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.530
 whether I am you or I hope so 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.170
 that is a yes i think that is actually mine 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.390
 position and I do n't think so 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.760
 retraining as I do when I'm in the rush 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.140
 harbor in the ten position but me 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.329
 find it a bit me and my 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.989
 position where you where you can do your best 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.610
 but yes that that is again that is 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 more my own opinions and my feelings 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.989
 and if they like them 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.370
 if people trust me on number 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.599
 exactly then I trust 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.599
 myself so we'll see 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.060
 you have taken a break then 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.370
 so you could just get on the sand 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.540
 can take it easy for a while 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.510
 how much fitness do you lose in that 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.920
 two weeks yes i think in my case 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.810
 frankly not much it is but 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.569
 two weeks ago or slightly more 16 days 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.780
 since the last match with under 21 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.329
 Denmark so yes I think so much is possible 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.780
 You don't lose in in two weeks time 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.280
 so now the intention is that i just 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.170
 can train well this week 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.150
 a few extra exercises a few I stand 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.940
 runs are going to do and that's why I 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.980
 just getting fitter again is the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.819
 important question are you top fit if 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.959
 you will soon be in the champion's league 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.030
 must take office 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.180
 of course that must also be yes I think 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.769
 well i hope so and she said it was the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.139
 I only expect that we have one 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.669
 just so so yes and then you notice 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.500
 also on then 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.169
 yes of course that is that we do 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.610
 everyone and I in particular yes that too 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.470
 just need one and of course here too 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.930
 or here the very first game of it 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.039
 season or in 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.479
 and in the teams that test all 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.229
 main match of theirs 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.940
 all of them 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.350
 it so far send I have to 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.759
 I just have to be ready for that 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.320
 just like everyone 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.880
 and there for me a buddy 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.259
 the new one from the a1 davy 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.770
 ajax supplier 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.930
 What did you think when you made sense? 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.370
 because yes no that is the leader of the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.650
 ten 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.780
 even without a band you notice it yes yes yes yes 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.150
 no it is that I think we are one 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.780
 few players or more that 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.000
 that the captain's tires 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.010
 could wear it but well i like it 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.740
 logical day gift feel where you notice 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.080
 it there took its attitude they are way 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.389
 in order to be a leader they way on it 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.940
 field to coach and therefore outside 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.460
 well that does that you just notice me 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.590
 think that up to nine out of ten players 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.060
 in the team would cover him so she will 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.150
 burn then you just know 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.250
 mutually that this is that I like so much 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.110
 the avelina one now again 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.960
 yeah sure that's nice then i have to 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.610
 only the tracing again becomes no we 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.110
 Keep yes I was not even doing so 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.300
 I can't say that 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.860
 I think that is better that oh no then 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 I have to now I have to do the actual 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.780
 become a top score then he may already be mine 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.780
 to be felt
