00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.149
 hi friends from youtube I have here a 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.410
 thermostat and this does not work and I want 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.620
 I want to try and see if I can 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 do to go down 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.029
 how they look does not work I'm going to put one 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.029
 That works 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.970
 and here I broke one by breaking the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 break this job because neither 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 I worked 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.240
 but this is already broken and it's not going to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240
 to serve 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.750
 so what I'm going to do is try 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.190
 hit it here or see if it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.150
 I can open carefully and see if what 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.670
 I can make him work 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.160
 and friends of youtube good as I said 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.680
 I was going to propose to fix this possible 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 this thermostat that did not work 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.860
 and I already did work 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.860
 they are going to see right now that they are already working 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.000
 here it is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.740
 now how I did it good pretty much 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.149
 Take this example to break 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.180
 what broke it did not work either and this 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.180
 look at the space between these 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 the minitas that you have inside look at that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.830
 here there was a small gap and what 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.260
 I did it with a drill 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.160
 grabbing of course grabbing with 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.160
 some tweezers of these 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.740
 I made a little hole here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.119
 I made a little hole and I made some 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.399
 small movements with a screwdriver 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.899
 little one in here and it was the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.899
 way that I made him work 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.900
 now that as it opened it opened a 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.270
 What I'm going to do is put them 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.630
 ok tight electric tape here 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.500
 around 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.330
 but well then this way that I 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.730
 I proposed to make it work and I did it 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.310
 to work 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.650
 making a hole with a drill and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.209
 moving it a little bit upwards 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.720
 down until I get that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.720
 will work 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 this is only done if you have 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.610
 a true need but of what 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.610
 otherwise a new one is bought 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.310
 I already put a piece of electric pib 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.989
 tight and the thermostat is 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.989
 as new we will see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.490
 we set the alarm 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.150
 Well, I do not know how, but I did it 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.120
 work here 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.810
 first I wanted to hole it here in the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.160
 bottom but not better use me 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.550
 of reference one that I had already done 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.920
 pieces and I said no here to the side here to 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.830
 one side I'm going to make a hole and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.180
 I move with the screwdriver quoted I started 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.690
 move like that a little bit until I saw that already 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.690
 work 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.020
 here is the thermostat that I repair 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.020
 let's see what he has been working 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.970
 and here I grab the idea of this the first 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.610
 that spoils breaking with a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.230
 hammer to see how it was inside and 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.910
 I gave him the idea I made a hole and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.440
 with a screwdriver quoted I started to move 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.870
 until work was like this 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.690
 this one that I have here was like this and I 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.230
 I made a little hole here 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.780
 and the idea worked 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.000
 I'll turn it off at this time take 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.640
 the current I'm going to put here the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.390
 screw hole 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.390
 I say the screwdriver 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.460
 but here here comes the screwdriver cited 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.460
 in or this little hole 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.240
 I hope this video is very helpful 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.830
 for technicians who live in places 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 where it is difficult to get the parts and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.349
 that sometimes to get a part 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.120
 he has to travel quite far and 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.599
 Well, the first thing you can try is 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.550
 what I did to do the little hole 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:41.780
 and with a small screwdriver move a 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.720
 little to make it work so 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.720
 I hope this video is very helpful
