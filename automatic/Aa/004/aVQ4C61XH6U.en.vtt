00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.599
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.450
 drake's talk about pornhub range nose 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.130
 this plugin is somewhat similar to everything 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.670
 the rest of the plugin which overlooked 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 there is a compass on ebay shantom and many 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.260
 others that is not this all union in 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.720
 one but itachi the other is purely for 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.730
 for example hunts both that is where 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.220
 choose a server or something like that 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.700
 that is, it could be done through 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.100
 bones jen items &amp; compass navigational 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.309
 then connect all that blew up plugins 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 that is, if it's all set up of course 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.070
 if you don't like it all set up 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.280
 this business for you will disappear here just 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.090
 it's very comfortable let's go our 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.020
 we will look at a config as we see here 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.479
 we have beech config hop broadcast rank 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.210
 inventory and services vector and casts 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.110
 link so let's start for the tip 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.390
 let's go to start the world name what 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.410
 will the world use it well for example 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.360
 even let it be yes world adventure 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.110
 game that is, that they do not destroy 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.030
 blocks 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.560
 i.e. it is adventure 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.670
 mode, that is, it is impossible; 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 destroy blog 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.099
 it is quite comfortable sleeping 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.649
 there is an effect of speed can be distinguished 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.130
 if included here you can put some 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.330
 level 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.929
 speed jump and he is already a potion 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.619
 jumping in the same force you can put 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:51.060
 n p and the date is what they recorded all this 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.660
 garbage that is to make it easier 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.880
 hangar is us and hunger if we turn 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.970
 true it means we turn off hunger and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.849
 we will have this convenient chat kids are taught 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 can of course turn it on or off 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:10.660
 at your discretion 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.220
 so rain too true we put this drop true 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.080
 You can of course turn off 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.840
 check 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.600
 in the game and we see here is not nothing I 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 I can not even throw that is this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.830
 very comfortable 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.410
 so liv month that is if for example 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.050
 someone above can write here will 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.210
 written message or john month 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.730
 for example, it can be altered or even 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.040
 disable it to make it easier for you 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.680
 for example because i labor put there with us 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.710
 off immediately and with quite convenient 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 that is, it does not need changes config 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 and much more to teleport 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.490
 Player join, that is, you can enable 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.270
 of course and he be a little change your 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.700
 location chat message this already when 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.040
 if we write something here sorry that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.610
 is decent unless of course you want it 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.690
 to make 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.870
 can you put it here to us 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.209
 offer to enable or single module 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.959
 module and all worlds we put falls to that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.160
 that we don't want just for one to eat 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.060
 so but this is steel and tim &amp; team 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.220
 sleep gives 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.850
 that is, if we are given these things again 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.410
 at death yes so but that's all 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.680
 the rest is element 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.410
 in which it is who stands still and then 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 you can turn on and we will kick 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:45.430
 in 60 seconds for example and here we are already 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:50.290
 written message will be sticking out so well in 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.920
 us a torch and all that is that is or it is 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.049
 even wait do you most likely 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.650
 transports there is and set fire to something like 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.170
 of this but most likely if it is possible 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:07.060
 to get burned there is something well in general is 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:10.420
 so got jump we can set true too 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.269
 so in general let's see 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.870
 now beech 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:19.479
