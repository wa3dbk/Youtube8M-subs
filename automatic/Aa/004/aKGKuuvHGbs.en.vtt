00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
we're showing a lot of video of how it

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.710 
we're showing a lot of video of how it
works<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.640> when<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:22.790> first<00:02:23.000> went<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.299> you<00:02:23.510> said

mean it's not something that you do so
many<00:02:38.060> things<00:02:38.329> when<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.569> was<00:02:38.750> writing<00:02:38.959> all<00:02:39.170> your

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
many things when I was writing all your

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.390 
many things when I was writing all your
credentials<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.099> have<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.310> many

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
credentials and you have so many

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.309 
credentials and you have so many
credentials<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.150> had<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.390> actually<00:02:41.480> take

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
credentials but you had to actually take

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.680 
credentials but you had to actually take
courses<00:02:42.650> or<00:02:42.890> learn<00:02:43.069> about<00:02:43.099> VelaShape<00:02:43.760> yeah

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
courses or learn about VelaShape yeah

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.030 
courses or learn about VelaShape yeah
definitely<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.200> need<00:02:45.319> there's<00:02:45.530> an<00:02:45.650> intense

definitely you need there's an intense

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.009 
definitely you need there's an intense
certification<00:02:46.819> involved<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.480> training

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
certification involved in training

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.229 
certification involved in training
involved<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.829> VelaShape<00:02:49.099> technology<00:02:49.790> but

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
involved in the VelaShape technology but

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.430 
involved in the VelaShape technology but
the<00:02:50.329> beauty<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.629> this<00:02:50.780> technology<00:02:51.349> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the beauty of this technology is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.710 
the beauty of this technology is
relatively<00:02:51.890> safe<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.329> it's<00:02:53.540> your

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
relatively safe it's you know it's your

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.170 
relatively safe it's you know it's your
it's<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.230> non-surgical<00:02:55.090> alternative<00:02:56.090> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
it's the non-surgical alternative to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.420 
it's the non-surgical alternative to
liposuction<00:02:56.440> basically<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.920> not<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.280> course

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
liposuction basically it's not of course

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.680 
liposuction basically it's not of course
a<00:02:58.579> weight<00:02:58.700> loss<00:02:58.849> procedure<00:02:59.299> but<00:02:59.540> it's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
a weight loss procedure but it's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.199 
a weight loss procedure but it's
something<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.290> effectively<00:03:00.920> reduce<00:03:01.250> fat<00:03:01.849> and

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
something to effectively reduce fat and

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.030 
something to effectively reduce fat and
cellulite<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.290> that's<00:03:03.440> nothing<00:03:03.829> on<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
cellulite and that's nothing on the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.619 
cellulite and that's nothing on the
market<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.269> before<00:03:05.420> and

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
market like that and the before and

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.059 
market like that and the before and
after<00:03:05.870> pictures<00:03:06.170> are<00:03:06.319> amazing<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.829> mean<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
after pictures are amazing I mean the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.800 
after pictures are amazing I mean the
ones<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.400> I've<00:03:07.519> seen<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.239> have<00:03:08.269> here

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
ones that I've seen that we have here

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.629 
ones that I've seen that we have here
some<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> women<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:09.889> have<00:03:09.980> had<00:03:10.040> children

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
some of the women that have had children

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.180 
some of the women that have had children
like<00:03:10.790> myself<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.569> you<00:03:11.810> know<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.230> work<00:03:12.500> enough

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
like myself and you know you work enough

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.030 
like myself and you know you work enough
on<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:13.819> one<00:03:14.150> area<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.989> really<00:03:15.739> can

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
on that one area and it really can

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.370 
on that one area and it really can
reduce<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.670> down<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:17.090> flat<00:03:17.269> stomach<00:03:17.600> and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
reduce it down to a flat stomach and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.690 
reduce it down to a flat stomach and
that's<00:03:18.680> something<00:03:18.859> like<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.220> said<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.549> used

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
that's something like you said we used

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.520 
that's something like you said we used
to<00:03:19.760> have<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.239> get<00:03:20.329> liposuction<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:21.290> do

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
to have to go and get liposuction to do

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.379 
to have to go and get liposuction to do
exactly<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.849> can<00:03:22.970> only<00:03:23.090> be<00:03:23.299> achieved

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
exactly and it can only be achieved

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.479 
exactly and it can only be achieved
because<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.500> got<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.799> synergistic

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
because it's it's got a synergistic

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.280 
because it's it's got a synergistic

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.920 
infrared and bipolar radiofrequency
current<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.340> actually<00:03:37.849> heat<00:03:38.329> up<00:03:38.359> those<00:03:38.690> fat

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
current to actually heat up those fat

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.870 
current to actually heat up those fat
cells<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.440> actually<00:03:39.620> metabolize<00:03:40.370> them<00:03:40.669> and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
cells and actually metabolize them and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.990 
cells and actually metabolize them and
eventually<00:03:41.720> reduce<00:03:42.680> those<00:03:42.919> fat<00:03:43.160> chambers<00:03:43.639> so

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
eventually reduce those fat chambers so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.180 
eventually reduce those fat chambers so
a<00:03:44.060> thing<00:03:44.299> as<00:03:44.660> these<00:03:45.169> large<00:03:45.380> grapes<00:03:45.859> which<00:03:46.069> are

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
a thing as these large grapes which are

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.220 
a thing as these large grapes which are
your<00:03:46.280> clusters<00:03:46.639> of<00:03:46.669> fat<00:03:46.970> cells<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.389> reducing

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
your clusters of fat cells and reducing

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.809 
your clusters of fat cells and reducing
and<00:03:48.380> removing<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:48.950> fat<00:03:49.160> from<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.579> and

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
and removing the fat from that and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.699 
and removing the fat from that and
reducing<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.419> to<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.569> sides<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:50.930> raisins<00:03:51.349> and

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
reducing it to the sides or raisins and

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.339 
reducing it to the sides or raisins and
that's<00:03:52.639> what<00:03:53.090> basically<00:03:53.419> achieves<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.230> then

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
that's what basically achieves and then

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.759 
that's what basically achieves and then
you<00:03:54.500> add<00:03:54.760> vacuum<00:03:55.760> technology<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.540> massage<00:03:56.900> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
you add vacuum technology and massage to

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.550 
you add vacuum technology and massage to
to<00:03:58.250> actually<00:03:58.910> improve<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.480> skin<00:03:59.780> texture<00:04:00.319> on

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
to actually improve the skin texture on

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.730 
to actually improve the skin texture on
the<00:04:00.680> surface<00:04:00.829> as<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.489> in

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
on the market you know if you look at

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.550 
on the market you know if you look at
the<00:04:16.100> procedures<00:04:16.670> performed<00:04:17.150> today

the procedures performed today

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.599 
the procedures performed today
liposuction<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.620> probably<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.980> most<00:04:19.160> common

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
liposuction is probably the most common

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.220 
liposuction is probably the most common
procedure<00:04:19.970> people<00:04:20.329> are<00:04:20.419> very<00:04:20.600> body<00:04:20.900> conscious

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
procedure people are very body conscious

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.370 
procedure people are very body conscious
but<00:04:22.100> there's<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:23.030> it's<00:04:23.540> also<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.140> number

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
but there's this it's also the number

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.800 
but there's this it's also the number

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
one cause of morbidity among surgical

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.840 
one cause of morbidity among surgical
procedures<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.770> there's<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.130> need<00:04:28.400> for<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.640> on
