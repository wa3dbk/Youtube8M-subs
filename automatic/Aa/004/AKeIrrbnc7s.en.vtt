00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 still a world championship in the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.580
 green pearl that becomes for four 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.109
 days capital of world modeling 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 and in fact the polysportiva spontricciolo 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.269
 model section to organize the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.059
 world championship bike 1 to 5 championship 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.520
 of the world 2012 in a single confidential test 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 in motion, radio-controlled scale models 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
 1 5 world test takes place in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.310
 collaboration with the republic of san 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 marine and with the patronage of the municipality of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.320
 riccione from 23 to 26 August on the track 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 of riccione models from via saluzzo 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 born in 1998 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.329
 here we are like the gp teams 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 let's say they have all the equipment 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.040
 that they have in motogp 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.950
 let's see the bikes then when 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.840
 they wait for their practice session they have 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.170
 the electric blankets we have the telemetry 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.269
 so every driver knows 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 at any time when he's out and about 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.050
 when it's running on the track 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 what is the average speed lap? 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390
 as we say the engine temperature 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.990
 the temperature of the tires then all 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.670
 a series of surveys that we say 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.570
 they bring modeling motion closer 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
 al to real motorcycles and how in motion 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.630
 gp 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 here too the life of the paddock is marked 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.369
 from find technical and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 a lot of technology with the bike that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.050
 often it becomes Gianni Zonzini already 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.119
 former world champion and here today a 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.700
 riccione to go back to it or 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.069
 This year there are chances like 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.950
 the team's budget is never too small 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.780
 the budget and indeed it was beautiful 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.690
 tall just helping out one 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 alternative of tires that has upset a 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.240
 all things and up to the warm up of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.420
 May the bike was going very well indeed 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 I won it so let's say I was 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.899
 highly competitive then here 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.969
 tires make the difference and how 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.369
 everywhere they make difference like in the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.159
 moto gp as in the car for those who do not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.350
 knew for those unfamiliar with this 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.280
 world 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.140
 and proper and as a motogp in scale now 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.989
 let's not exaggerate the problems 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.520
 are the same then eventually goes to 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.610
 get your hands on something more 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.810
 however, the problems are simple 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 similar very similar 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.690
 here we have an aspiring champion and how 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 is going this weekend riccione sta 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.459
 going very well however at the end of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.530
 qualifications are third so we'll see 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.380
 in the next serious I will go out to improve 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 so for now we are committed to the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.410
 improvement 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 we met a former San marinese 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.600
 world champion but the strongest now 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.750
 there are and there are very strong 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.450
 Austrian 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.100
 there are very strong Germans and gods 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.769
 very strong Italians from San Marino 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.870
 very strong from the cc there is a good one 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.870
 level in all nations as it is born 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.370
 this passion of model-making first 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 of cars then out of curiosity my friend 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.959
 made me try a bike and got me 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.000
 hit it started the love hit me 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.250
 immediately the driving style the precision 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.100
 that it takes the passion that it takes 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.380
 even in the car, building pieces 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.829
 etc. and then then from there one was born 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.290
 final curiosity a love is a hobby 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:23.690
 expensive did these levels begin 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.280
 to become a bell'impegno but closes 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.790
 one eye closes two of the times 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.200
 and pull forward to close president 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.600
 for those who somehow wanted 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.450
 approaching approach to this 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.170
 pastime of discipline and let's finish it 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.950
 as you wish 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.800
 how can we do we say that 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.410
 the simplest thing is to come 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.200
 at the riccione track us 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.569
 usually the managers and Saturdays 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.950
 on Sundays they are present on the track 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:58.370
 so I'm from chumby to give all 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.930
 the appropriate information to address 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.650
 then who wants or for the bike for cars 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.080
 model maybe and have the how to say the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.580
 want to try your hand at 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.140
 guide to these racing cars when you do 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.920
 comes to certain levels really damage 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.920
 great satisfaction
