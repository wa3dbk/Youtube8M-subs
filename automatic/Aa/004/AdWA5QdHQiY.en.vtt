okay here's how I upgraded my speakers

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay here's how I upgraded my speakers
on<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.560> Terrenas<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.069> took<00:00:05.220> pictures<00:00:05.430> while<00:00:05.819> I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
on the Terrenas I took pictures while I

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.909 
on the Terrenas I took pictures while I
did<00:00:06.150> everything<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:06.870> if<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.080> follow<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.649> link

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the a box there's the six screws get

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.480 
the a box there's the six screws get
those<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> old<00:00:18.930> speaker<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.189> as

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
those out the old speaker you can see as

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
those out the old speaker you can see as
it's<00:00:21.180> pretty<00:00:21.449> tiny<00:00:21.750> compared<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> one

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
it's pretty tiny compared to the one

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.400 
it's pretty tiny compared to the one
that<00:00:22.949> gets<00:00:23.369> put<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> that's<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.080> kind<00:00:25.320> of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that gets put in and that's just kind of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
that gets put in and that's just kind of
sitting<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:28.699> down<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.230> just

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
sitting down down in here and you just

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
sitting down down in here and you just
kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> pop<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.730> hot<00:00:32.969> glued<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
kind of pop it out it's hot glued and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
kind of pop it out it's hot glued and
then<00:00:34.649> unsolder

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then unsolder

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.510 
then unsolder
the<00:00:35.940> wire<00:00:36.180> that's<00:00:36.570> attached<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the wire that's attached to it this is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.510 
the wire that's attached to it this is
the<00:00:38.820> wire<00:00:39.120> that's<00:00:39.809> attached<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the wire that's attached to it and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
the wire that's attached to it and
you'll<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> plugs<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you'll see that that plugs into the to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
you'll see that that plugs into the to
the<00:00:44.610> printed<00:00:44.969> circuit<00:00:45.120> board<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.710> what

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the printed circuit board and then what

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.510 
the printed circuit board and then what
I<00:00:46.920> did<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.550> had<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:49.289> green<00:00:49.680> thing<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.340> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I did is I had this green thing is just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.930 
I did is I had this green thing is just
a<00:00:50.610> 3d<00:00:51.030> printed<00:00:52.070> I'll<00:00:53.070> include<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> link<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a 3d printed I'll include a link to that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
a 3d printed I'll include a link to that
somebody<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.690> Thingiverse<00:00:55.020> very<00:00:55.980> nicely

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
somebody up on Thingiverse very nicely

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.540 
somebody up on Thingiverse very nicely
uploaded<00:00:56.969> back<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:59.100> put<00:01:00.260> glue<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.550> hot

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
uploaded back and I put glue there hot

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.810 
uploaded back and I put glue there hot
glue<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:03.539> everything<00:01:03.780> together<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
glue here put everything together and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.410 
glue here put everything together and
then<00:01:05.820> soldered<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.760> leads<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> there

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
then soldered the leads on to there

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
then soldered the leads on to there
actually<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.500> soldered<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> leads<00:01:11.130> first<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually I soldered the leads first and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.390 
actually I soldered the leads first and
then<00:01:11.760> hot<00:01:11.939> glued<00:01:12.150> everything<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.409> then

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
then hot glued everything in and then

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.690 
then hot glued everything in and then
put<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.479> connector<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.220> seems<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
put the connector back so that seems to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
put the connector back so that seems to
be<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> give<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> try<00:01:19.680> right

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
be it I'm going to give it a try right

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.090 
be it I'm going to give it a try right
now<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.790> how<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.119> goes<00:01:24.470> okay<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.860> we've
