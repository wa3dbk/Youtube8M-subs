driving<00:03:00.519> dynamics<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.300> think<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.930> actually

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
driving dynamics I think it actually

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140

makes<00:03:02.650> quite<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> bit<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.370> sense<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.850> does

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
makes quite a bit of sense it does

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.360 
makes quite a bit of sense it does
improve<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.170> driving<00:03:05.350> experience<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.220> make

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
improve the driving experience and make

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.680 
improve the driving experience and make
it<00:03:06.519> more<00:03:06.700> fun<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.709> flick<00:03:08.709> some<00:03:08.860> shifts<00:03:09.459> and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it more fun to flick some shifts and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.479 
it more fun to flick some shifts and
because<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.470> vehicle<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:12.130> capable<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:15.160> not

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
because the vehicle is capable it's not

it's<00:03:15.880> not<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> joke<00:03:16.569> it's<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> waste<00:03:17.410> it

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
it's not a joke it's not a waste it

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.979 
it's not a joke it's not a waste it
actually<00:03:18.220> adds<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> experience<00:03:19.269> instead
