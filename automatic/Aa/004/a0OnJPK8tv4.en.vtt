tonight<00:03:35.460> terrific<00:03:36.460> home<00:03:36.610> crowd<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.030> play<00:03:37.210> in

entertaining for the guys scored two
great<00:03:49.300> goals<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.590> thought<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.880> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
great goals I thought that the the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.670 
great goals I thought that the the
changes<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:52.810> made<00:03:52.930> at<00:03:53.050> halftime<00:03:53.260> were

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
changes that we made at halftime were

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.250 
changes that we made at halftime were
again<00:03:53.920> good<00:03:54.220> we<00:03:54.970> needed<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.720> little<00:03:55.930> bit<00:03:56.020> more

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
again good we needed a little bit more

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.410 
again good we needed a little bit more
perhaps<00:03:56.440> from<00:03:56.770> our<00:03:56.860> wide<00:03:57.010> backs<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.240> game

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
perhaps from our wide backs in the game

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.030 
perhaps from our wide backs in the game
just<00:03:58.600> in<00:03:58.900> general<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.710> a<00:03:59.740> little<00:03:59.920> better

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
just in general to be a little better

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.090 
just in general to be a little better
with<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> ball<00:04:00.570> but<00:04:01.570> overall<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.110> am<00:04:02.260> pleased<00:04:02.950> I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
with the ball but overall I am pleased I

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
with the ball but overall I am pleased I
thought<00:04:03.250> we<00:04:03.370> created<00:04:03.730> some<00:04:03.880> good

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
thought we created some good

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.520 
thought we created some good
opportunities<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.900> run<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.170> play<00:04:05.200> and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
opportunities in the run of play and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.060 
opportunities in the run of play and
some<00:04:05.740> good<00:04:05.920> opportunities<00:04:06.490> on<00:04:06.670> set<00:04:06.850> pieces
