by the two screens obviously having two

life<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> would<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> normal

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
life then you would see with a normal

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.270 
life then you would see with a normal
phone<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> course<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.410> won't<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.069> both

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
phone but of course you won't have both

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.590 
phone but of course you won't have both
screens<00:02:11.520> open<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.330> time

screens open all the time

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.470

so<00:02:12.960> hopefully<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.070> won't<00:02:14.280> be<00:02:14.340> too<00:02:14.430> bad<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so hopefully it won't be too bad so I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.850 
so hopefully it won't be too bad so I
think<00:02:15.600> having<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.200> screens<00:02:16.560> could

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
think having two screens could

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.230 
think having two screens could
definitely<00:02:17.220> take<00:02:17.460> some<00:02:17.640> getting<00:02:17.850> used<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.210> but

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
definitely take some getting used to but

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210 
definitely take some getting used to but
it's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.570> very<00:02:18.600> cool<00:02:19.050> idea<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.070> doesn't

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
it's a very cool idea if it doesn't

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860 
it's a very cool idea if it doesn't
impact<00:02:20.370> too<00:02:20.670> much<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.000> battery<00:02:21.330> life<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.690> is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
impact too much on battery life that is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.810 
impact too much on battery life that is
