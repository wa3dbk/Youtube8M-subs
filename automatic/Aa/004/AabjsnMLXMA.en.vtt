is drawing the book illustrating the
book<00:01:22.020> awesome<00:01:22.469> artists<00:01:22.829> have<00:01:22.920> worked<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
book awesome artists have worked with

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:24.859 
book awesome artists have worked with
him<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.369> quite<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> while<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> he<00:01:24.360> loves<00:01:24.600> nest

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
him for quite a while and he loves nest

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.060 
him for quite a while and he loves nest
or<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.200> understands<00:01:25.590> his<00:01:25.710> body<00:01:25.920> language

or two he understands his body language

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.999 
or two he understands his body language
so<00:01:27.000> Sinestra<00:01:27.539> being<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> Green<00:01:28.049> Lantern<00:01:28.079> it's<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
so Sinestra being a Green Lantern it's a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.709 
so Sinestra being a Green Lantern it's a
bit<00:01:29.159> uncomfortable<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.270> he's<00:01:30.420> never<00:01:30.539> gonna
