00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
was buried and I wouldn't argue with any

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.060 
was buried and I wouldn't argue with any
of<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:52.959> not<00:03:53.110> Jesus<00:03:53.320> that's<00:03:53.830> for

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
of that but it's not Jesus that's for

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.460 
of that but it's not Jesus that's for
sure<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:55.450> shorter<00:03:55.750> turn<00:03:55.900> might<00:03:56.110> even<00:03:56.260> be

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
sure and the shorter turn might even be

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.740 
sure and the shorter turn might even be
a<00:03:56.500> fake<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.250> according<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.940> Ron<00:03:58.269> white<00:03:58.540> at<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
a fake as according to Ron white at the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.870 
a fake as according to Ron white at the
Christian<00:03:59.290> Indiana<00:03:59.680> Jones<00:04:00.010> archaeologist

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
Christian Indiana Jones archaeologist

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.479 
Christian Indiana Jones archaeologist
and<00:04:01.080> even<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.170> my<00:04:02.290> opinion<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.920> does<00:04:03.100> look<00:04:03.340> kind

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
and even in my opinion it does look kind

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.020 
and even in my opinion it does look kind
of<00:04:03.640> kind<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.269> like<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> fake<00:04:06.070> because<00:04:06.880> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
of kind of like like a fake because it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.290 
of kind of like like a fake because it
looks<00:04:07.239> quite<00:04:07.510> cartoony<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.380> my<00:04:08.650> opinion<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:10.090> I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
looks quite cartoony in my opinion but I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.990 
looks quite cartoony in my opinion but I
think<00:04:10.739> what<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.769> really<00:04:12.130> think<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.550> that<00:04:12.610> God

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
think what I really think is that God

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.330 
think what I really think is that God
destroyed<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.260> actual<00:04:14.590> burial<00:04:14.800> cloths<00:04:15.070> that

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
destroyed the actual burial cloths that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.759 
destroyed the actual burial cloths that
Jesus<00:04:15.700> was<00:04:15.910> buried<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.590> because<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.620> think

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
Jesus was buried in because I think

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.380 
Jesus was buried in because I think
people<00:04:18.190> would<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.400> been<00:04:18.489> really<00:04:19.000> moved<00:04:19.239> to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
people would have been really moved to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.360 
people would have been really moved to
make<00:04:19.540> an<00:04:19.660> idol<00:04:19.989> out<00:04:20.080> of<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.560> mean<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:21.010> house
