you can remember which model is which

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.420 
you can remember which model is which
the<00:01:47.660> normal<00:01:47.960> reverse<00:01:48.260> function<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.160> end

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
the normal reverse function the end

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.660 
the normal reverse function the end
point<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:51.350> EBS<00:01:51.770> function<00:01:52.190> which<00:01:52.370> is<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
point the EBS function which is the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.490 
point the EBS function which is the
anti-lock<00:01:53.030> brakes<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.660> can<00:01:53.810> set<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.290> with

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
anti-lock brakes so we can set it with

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.370 
anti-lock brakes so we can set it with
pulse<00:01:56.680> exponential<00:01:57.680> do<00:01:58.550> rates<00:01:59.110> for<00:02:00.110> all

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
pulse exponential do rates for all

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.010 
pulse exponential do rates for all
channels<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:02.120> train<00:02:02.360> function<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:02.840> well

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
channels and the train function as well

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.640 
channels and the train function as well
so<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:04.100> some<00:02:04.780> clean<00:02:05.780> nice<00:02:06.020> looking<00:02:06.410> radio

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
so this is some clean nice looking radio

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.500 
so this is some clean nice looking radio
got<00:02:06.890> all<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.130> functions<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.640> need<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.060> it's

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
got all the functions you need and it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.710 
got all the functions you need and it's
a<00:02:08.600> free<00:02:08.780> channel<00:02:09.170> system<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.830> for<00:02:10.130> your<00:02:10.280> arm<00:02:10.760> so

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
a free channel system so for your arm so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.390 
a free channel system so for your arm so
if<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.020> want<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> monster<00:02:12.770> truck<00:02:13.010> with<00:02:13.280> a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
if you want like a monster truck with a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.310 
if you want like a monster truck with a
reverse<00:02:13.760> module<00:02:14.330> then<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.080> switch

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
reverse module then you can just switch

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.730 
reverse module then you can just switch
from<00:02:15.560> we<00:02:15.709> were<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.250> forward<00:02:17.060> by<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.740> button
