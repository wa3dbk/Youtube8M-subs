00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
will be perfectly honest the reason is

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.210 
will be perfectly honest the reason is
simple<00:03:53.389> I<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.810> hit<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.380> step<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.920> never

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
simple I just hit that step I never

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.800 
simple I just hit that step I never
really<00:03:55.489> have<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.730> time<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.000> do<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.630> always

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
really have the time to do it I always

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.449 
really have the time to do it I always
feel<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> adds<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.709> much<00:03:57.799> more<00:03:58.010> work<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.430> a

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
feel like it adds so much more work to a

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.430 
feel like it adds so much more work to a
dessert<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.269> try<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.599> find<00:03:59.840> ways<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.290> get

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
around having to do it in the one way

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.940 
around having to do it in the one way
that<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.510> find<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.019> works<00:04:03.230> for<00:04:03.440> me<00:04:03.560> everytime

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
that I find that works for me everytime

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.580

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
400 degrees for about 15 minutes what

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.729 
400 degrees for about 15 minutes what
that's<00:04:11.480> going<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.720> do<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:12.049> bake<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.500> tart

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
shell really really quickly so that it

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.060 
shell really really quickly so that it
doesn't<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.870> soggy<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.470> then<00:04:15.769> I'm<00:04:15.859> going<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
doesn't get soggy and then I'm going to

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.400

lower the oven to about 350 for the rest
of<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.650> cooking<00:04:18.829> time<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.700> way<00:04:19.940> it

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
of the cooking time that way it

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.819 
of the cooking time that way it
alleviates<00:04:20.780> having<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.139> pre-bake<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.590> tart

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
alleviates having to pre-bake the tart

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.409 
alleviates having to pre-bake the tart
shell<00:04:22.039> but<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.400> still<00:04:22.669> end<00:04:22.880> up<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> really

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
shell but you still end up with a really

shell but you still end up with a really
nice<00:04:23.660> crisp<00:04:23.990> crust<00:04:24.289> here's<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.430> final<00:04:25.760> step

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
nice crisp crust here's the final step

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.710
