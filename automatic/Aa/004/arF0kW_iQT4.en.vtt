00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.410
 came out gta5 then why don't i do 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.510
 Easter eggs from gta san andreas I think 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 just in time anyway, we at 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.070
 dump with gta sanandres and 1 easter egg 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.980
 will be quite creepy the first of them 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.080
 this zombie building kiln the tip of the iceberg 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.869
 so to say insidiously laboratories 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 zombie production and direct reference to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.689
 principle to the resident evil series and to theirs 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 umbrella corporations who too 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 doing kai stuff 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 and by cooking zombies of all sorts of mutants 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.680
 the biological weapons of the other arena are here 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 several elevators underground too and elevator 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 the zombie lab is so funny 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 Easter Egg is an opinion that is still here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.039
 can be met at night or 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.649
 zombie nights say neither those nor others i 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.410
 I haven't seen her here 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 120 percent more accurately say 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.359
 that they are not here the next task we have 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 also not very nice it is a crypt on 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.470
 Los Santos Cemetery 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.470
 and a couple of graves here for some reason open and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.350
 on and on 1 are in a pizza box 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.210
 mother of karla who is not little 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.450

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 Carla 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 yes because she was notable graphically 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 at one time until I crashed 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.459
 military submarine with him like 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.590

 Pacific Fleet America and in honor 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.079
 he is named a whole class of warships

 nimitz class aircraft carriers 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.230
 healthy colossus which generally smash 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.819
 you can afford everything for nothing and if 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.620
 Incidentally run through the military 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.720
 base then you can find crowbar gordon 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.780
 Freeman which is strongly taken away on experience and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.440
 empty proudly gone 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.470
 also here you can meet cardboard 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.530
 los santosa and this is the radar 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.269
 systems according to him apparently anyone 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.160
 ever wondered why in san 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.940
 fierro so many destroyed buildings 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.730
 for example this bridge or troika next to 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.340
 garage cj really not on anyone 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.930
 no secret that san fierro drew with 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.549
 real city 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.860
 san francisco and san francisco as in 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.030
 san fierro 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:11.799
 there was an earthquake that's not there 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:16.290
 fame shatal some buildings in gta it 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.290
 due exactly to the earthquake 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.729
 also on one of the streets of san fierro 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.210
 to meet such a funny temple 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.390
 happy who smokes a joint and something he 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.099
 similar to one of the heroes 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.960
 gta sanandres was there too 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:38.469
 happy who was not indifferent to 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.330
 pigtails well, the next Easter egg is created 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.690
 especially for those who like to walk away from 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.310
 chase with style with james bond style 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.780
 Here and in the vastness of sanandres, but there is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.659
 such a funny cave 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.150
 in which you can reset one star 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:56.890
 and at the exit of which there is a pier 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.960
 which is already waiting for you boat here and also 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.520
 if you bought a house upstairs then you 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.390
 You can there for the union if it is absolutely 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.210
 secured 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.300
 I think this place is just a special 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.070
 created to leave the chase 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.669

 video from gta 4 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.150
 that which hints so transparently to us 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.030
 the fact that there is no Easter 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.400
 eggs and what we can get out of here 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.970
