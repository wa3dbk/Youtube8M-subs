00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
yeah that's a lot of flame swampy this

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
yeah that's a lot of flame swampy this
is<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.970> low<00:01:12.560> ya<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:14.700> hardly<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.689> handled

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
is on low ya can hardly get that handled

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.620 
is on low ya can hardly get that handled
in<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.530> great<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
in there good great this is what you can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
in there good great this is what you can
see<00:01:18.810> every<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> flame<00:01:19.740> flips<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.400> like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
see every time the flame flips up like

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
see every time the flame flips up like
that<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.060> putting<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> drop<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.979> our

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that is putting a drop in there so our

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
that is putting a drop in there so our
question<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:24.170> how<00:01:25.170> long<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:26.000> five<00:01:27.000> gallons<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
question is how long is five gallons of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.960 
question is how long is five gallons of
diesel<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> last<00:01:28.409> us<00:01:28.759> that's<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.939> we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
diesel going to last us that's what we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
diesel going to last us that's what we
got<00:01:30.210> five<00:01:30.659> gallons<00:01:31.140> drip<00:01:31.950> by<00:01:32.130> drip<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.320> if<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
got five gallons drip by drip so if this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.490 
got five gallons drip by drip so if this
was<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> primary<00:01:38.159> heat<00:01:38.610> source<00:01:39.200> how

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.719 

economical<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.939> using<00:01:44.939> diesel<00:01:45.360> work<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
economical would using diesel work and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
economical would using diesel work and
I'm<00:01:47.729> wondering<00:01:48.119> -<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.710> recycled<00:01:51.200> used

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
I'm wondering - if you recycled used

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.569 
I'm wondering - if you recycled used
automotive<00:01:53.039> oil<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:55.070> work<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
automotive oil if it would work on this

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
automotive oil if it would work on this
so<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.210> basically<00:01:57.539> get<00:01:57.960> used<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.439> motor

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so you can basically get used on a motor

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.609 
so you can basically get used on a motor
oil<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.159> free<00:01:59.780> every<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.259> friends

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
oil for free every time your friends

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.830 
oil for free every time your friends
change<00:02:01.979> their<00:02:02.220> car<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.299> set<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
change their car or you can set up a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.710 
change their car or you can set up a
donation<00:02:04.530> station<00:02:05.460> people<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> your

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
donation station people in your

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.210 
donation station people in your
neighborhood<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.350> drop<00:02:07.560> off<00:02:07.770> they're<00:02:07.979> used

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
neighborhood can drop off they're used

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.500 
neighborhood can drop off they're used
to<00:02:08.429> oil<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.319> burn<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.009> smells<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to oil and you can burn it it smells a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.120 
to oil and you can burn it it smells a
little<00:02:13.080> bit<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.880> think<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> far<00:02:16.860> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
little bit but I think so far it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.830 
little bit but I think so far it's
tolerable<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.630> would<00:02:18.720> be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
tolerable I don't know what it would be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.520 
tolerable I don't know what it would be
like<00:02:18.870> inside<00:02:19.440> indoors<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.900> testing
