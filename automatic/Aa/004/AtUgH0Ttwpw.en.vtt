00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
on the bottom of them so that actually

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.070 
on the bottom of them so that actually
stick<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> carpet

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080

he<00:02:13.080> said<00:02:14.090> they're<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.180> moving<00:02:15.480> much<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
he said they're not moving much that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.120

won't<00:02:18.150> move<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.270> little<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:19.290> there<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.100> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
won't move a little because there is a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730 
won't move a little because there is a
lot<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.390> does<00:02:21.840> take<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> fair<00:02:22.260> bit<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.530> force

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
lot of it does take a fair bit of force

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.330 
lot of it does take a fair bit of force
to<00:02:22.920> push<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> brake<00:02:24.060> pedal<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.250> while<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> got

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to push the brake pedal and while I got

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480 
to push the brake pedal and while I got
it<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.660> clutch<00:02:28.020> starts<00:02:28.800> off<00:02:28.980> firmer<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
it here the clutch starts off firmer and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.700 
it here the clutch starts off firmer and
then<00:02:29.610> gets<00:02:29.790> softer<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.570> then<00:02:30.960> just<00:02:31.170> sort<00:02:31.650> of

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
then gets softer and then just sort of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.250 
then gets softer and then just sort of
spring<00:02:32.010> back<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.660> accelerator<00:02:34.110> has

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
spring back up and the accelerator has

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.500 
spring back up and the accelerator has
just<00:02:34.650> got<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.070> nice<00:02:35.910> soft<00:02:36.180> amount<00:02:36.450> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
just got a nice soft amount of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.760 
just got a nice soft amount of
resistance<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.320> push<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.620> down

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
resistance so you can push it down

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.300 
resistance so you can push it down
fairly<00:02:38.070> easily

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.890 

some<00:02:41.310> people<00:02:41.520> buzz<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.970> pedals<00:02:42.240> as<00:02:42.570> much<00:02:42.720> they

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
some people buzz the pedals as much they

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990 
some people buzz the pedals as much they
look<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.110> metal<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:44.130> plastic<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:44.850> they're

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
look like metal that plastic but they're

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.280 
look like metal that plastic but they're
a<00:02:45.030> good<00:02:45.570> plastic<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:48.000> course<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.900> pedal

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
a good plastic and of course the pedal

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.450 
a good plastic and of course the pedal
base<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.800> plastic<00:02:50.300> now<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.960> use

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
base is plastic now you can use

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.330 
base is plastic now you can use
batteries<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.960> pedals<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.190> also

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
batteries for the pedals but it also

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.850 
batteries for the pedals but it also
comes<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:59.600> cable<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.560> attach

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
comes with a cable that you can attach

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.110 
comes with a cable that you can attach
it<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:05.270> right<00:03:06.710> here<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.430> goes

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it with right here and then that goes

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.380 
it with right here and then that goes
into<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:10.350> wheel<00:03:10.790> which<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:12.030> goes<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.210> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
into the wheel which then goes to a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.270 
into the wheel which then goes to a
power<00:03:12.570> supply<00:03:15.350> now<00:03:16.350> we'll<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.860> start<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
power supply now we'll just start the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:31.390 
power supply now we'll just start the
wheel<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> look<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.530> that

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.680 

as<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.520> can<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.970> automatically<00:03:33.420> gone

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
as you can see it's automatically gone

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.220 
as you can see it's automatically gone
to<00:03:34.370> Playstation<00:03:35.370> control<00:03:36.090> buttons<00:03:36.420> because

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
to Playstation control buttons because

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.920 
to Playstation control buttons because
the<00:03:37.410> buttons<00:03:37.890> are<00:03:38.090> nicely<00:03:39.090> backlit<00:03:39.630> which

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the buttons are nicely backlit which

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.690 
the buttons are nicely backlit which
you're<00:03:40.110> playing<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> dark<00:03:40.710> is<00:03:40.920> great<00:03:41.430> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
you're playing in the dark is great and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.840 
you're playing in the dark is great and
they'll<00:03:42.450> also<00:03:42.630> automatically<00:03:43.440> switch<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.100> PC

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
they'll also automatically switch to PC

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.270 
they'll also automatically switch to PC
if<00:03:45.000> you're<00:03:45.120> going<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.330> plug<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.630> into<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.840> PC<00:03:46.280> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
if you're going to plug it into a PC and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040 
if you're going to plug it into a PC and
if<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:47.580> don't<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.120> switch<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.750> manually

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
if they don't you can switch a manually

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.670 
if they don't you can switch a manually
which<00:03:49.290> I'll<00:03:49.500> show<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:49.950> later

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
which I'll show you later

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.080 
which I'll show you later
now<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.710> think<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.100> quite<00:03:53.310> important<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.880> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
now I think it's quite important that I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.520 
now I think it's quite important that I
should<00:03:54.150> go<00:03:54.420> through<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> mounting<00:03:55.110> system

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
should go through the mounting system

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.800 
should go through the mounting system
for<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.740> shifter<00:03:56.150> which<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.330> basically<00:03:57.690> just

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
for the shifter which is basically just

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.710 
for the shifter which is basically just
two<00:03:58.110> metal<00:03:58.410> bars<00:03:58.880> which<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.000> lot<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.240> people<00:04:00.510> say

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
two metal bars which a lot of people say

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.370 
two metal bars which a lot of people say
a<00:04:01.170> little<00:04:02.160> bit<00:04:02.250> flimsy<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.780> haven't<00:04:04.170> really

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
a little bit flimsy but I haven't really

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.120 
a little bit flimsy but I haven't really
found<00:04:05.360> now<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> little<00:04:07.050> bit<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.410> little

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
found now it is a little bit a little

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.400 
found now it is a little bit a little
bit<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.340> force<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.700> get<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:08.970> shifter<00:04:09.360> off<00:04:09.660> and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
bit of force to get the shifter off and

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.820 
bit of force to get the shifter off and
also<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.700> metal<00:04:12.060> bars<00:04:12.530> out<00:04:13.530> from<00:04:13.770> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
also to get the metal bars out from the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.699 
also to get the metal bars out from the
wheel<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:17.880> recommended<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.540> push<00:04:19.530> it

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
wheel it is recommended that you push it

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.600 
wheel it is recommended that you push it
onto<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> flat<00:04:20.430> surface<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.090> table<00:04:21.540> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
onto a flat surface like a table and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.360 
onto a flat surface like a table and
basically<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:23.820> will<00:04:23.970> just<00:04:24.210> slide<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.370> you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
basically this will just slide on you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.170 
basically this will just slide on you
can<00:04:26.640> mount<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.090> on<00:04:27.270> either<00:04:27.510> side<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.700> my<00:04:29.700> right

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
can mount it on either side but my right

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.540 
can mount it on either side but my right
hand<00:04:30.450> coordination<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.280> slightly<00:04:32.280> better

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
hand coordination is slightly better

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:42.590 
hand coordination is slightly better
than<00:04:32.669> my<00:04:32.880> left<00:04:39.440> as<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:41.700> might<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.090> able<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.390> see

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
than my left as you might be able to see

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.520 
than my left as you might be able to see
I've<00:04:42.810> committed<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.440> switch<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.250> PC<00:04:45.000> mode

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
I've committed it to switch to PC mode

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.730 
I've committed it to switch to PC mode
now<00:04:46.530> if<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.280> hold<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:48.570> this<00:04:49.169> button<00:04:49.500> here

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
now if you hold the this button here

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.500 
now if you hold the this button here
which<00:04:50.280> would<00:04:50.460> be<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.850> select<00:04:51.120> button<00:04:51.390> and

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
which would be the select button and

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.040 
which would be the select button and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
will switch modes there we go just great

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.500 
will switch modes there we go just great

on that anytime soon there have been
issues<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.000> since<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.510> latest<00:05:34.440> GT<00:05:34.890> 5

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
issues with it since the latest GT 5

issues with it since the latest GT 5
prologue<00:05:35.580> update<00:05:36.770> but<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:38.250> has<00:05:38.669> been<00:05:38.910> fixed

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
prologue update but that has been fixed

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.640 
prologue update but that has been fixed
with<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.479> firmware<00:05:39.990> update<00:05:40.320> for<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.530> wheel

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
with a firmware update for the wheel

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.540 
with a firmware update for the wheel
itself

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
itself

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.159 
itself
and<00:05:43.639> also<00:05:44.639> it's<00:05:45.360> got<00:05:45.509> this<00:05:45.599> little<00:05:45.780> screen

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
and also it's got this little screen

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.800 
and also it's got this little screen
here<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.970> you've<00:05:47.970> got<00:05:48.000> five<00:05:48.419> different

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810

here and you've got five different
presets<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:50.000> all<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.090> different<00:05:51.419> settings

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
presets of all the different settings

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.510 
presets of all the different settings
you<00:05:53.400> can<00:05:53.520> adjust<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:54.060> steering<00:05:54.300> angle<00:05:54.979> at<00:05:55.979> 180

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
you can adjust the steering angle at 180

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.740 
you can adjust the steering angle at 180
360<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.509> 900<00:05:57.930> degrees<00:05:59.180> you<00:06:00.180> can<00:06:00.330> adjust<00:06:00.629> the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
360 and 900 degrees you can adjust the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.140 
360 and 900 degrees you can adjust the
force<00:06:00.960> feedback<00:06:01.639> all<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.699> way<00:06:02.849> down<00:06:03.000> to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
force feedback all the way down to

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.290 
force feedback all the way down to
nothing<00:06:03.449> and<00:06:03.889> you<00:06:04.889> can<00:06:04.919> adjust<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.729> vibration

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
nothing and you can adjust the vibration

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.899 
nothing and you can adjust the vibration
motors<00:06:06.599> which<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.810> should<00:06:06.960> mention<00:06:07.080> ledges

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
motors which I should mention ledges

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.430 
motors which I should mention ledges
they're<00:06:08.909> more<00:06:09.090> like<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.330> rumble<00:06:09.509> motors<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.229> a

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
they're more like the rumble motors in a

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.999 
they're more like the rumble motors in a

in<00:06:14.069> the<00:06:14.159> wheel<00:06:14.280> itself<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:16.130> they<00:06:17.130> just<00:06:17.400> add<00:06:17.520> a

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
in the wheel itself and they just add a

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.240 
in the wheel itself and they just add a
nice<00:06:17.759> amount<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.449> vibration<00:06:19.020> which<00:06:19.250> by

ps3<00:06:29.729> games<00:06:30.150> at<00:06:30.300> least<00:06:30.389> take<00:06:30.690> advantage<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.349> it

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
ps3 games at least take advantage of it

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.409 
ps3 games at least take advantage of it
to<00:06:31.710> control<00:06:31.830> it<00:06:32.190> from<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.340> game<00:06:32.550> but<00:06:33.150> from

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
to control it from the game but from

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.120 
to control it from the game but from
what<00:06:33.599> I've<00:06:33.690> heard<00:06:33.719> there<00:06:34.050> are<00:06:34.080> some<00:06:34.440> PC<00:06:34.889> games

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130

what I've heard there are some PC games
that<00:06:35.400> do<00:06:36.919> I'm<00:06:37.919> like<00:06:38.099> the<00:06:38.219> g25

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
that do I'm like the g25

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.879 
that do I'm like the g25
this<00:06:39.270> only<00:06:39.479> has<00:06:39.690> one<00:06:39.960> force-feedback<00:06:40.500> motor

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
this only has one force-feedback motor

this only has one force-feedback motor
which<00:06:41.879> is<00:06:42.300> at<00:06:42.810> least<00:06:43.110> as<00:06:43.379> powerful<00:06:43.860> as<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:45.919> two

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919

force-feedback motors in the g25 put

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.209 
force-feedback motors in the g25 put
together<00:06:50.300> at<00:06:51.300> least<00:06:51.419> by<00:06:51.630> spec<00:06:51.960> and<00:06:52.169> I<00:06:52.740> can<00:06:53.069> tell

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219 
together at least by spec and I can tell

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.309 
together at least by spec and I can tell
you<00:06:53.340> when<00:06:53.909> you're<00:06:54.060> driving<00:06:54.240> it<00:06:54.449> sometimes<00:06:55.169> you

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
you when you're driving it sometimes you

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.270 
you when you're driving it sometimes you
are<00:06:55.409> going<00:06:55.560> to<00:06:55.620> want<00:06:55.740> to<00:06:55.770> turn<00:06:55.979> the<00:06:56.099> force

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
are going to want to turn the force

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.100 
are going to want to turn the force
feedback<00:06:56.490> down<00:06:58.039> there<00:06:59.039> are<00:06:59.190> also<00:06:59.690> drivers<00:07:00.690> for

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
feedback down there are also drivers for

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.230 
feedback down there are also drivers for
PC<00:07:01.560> that<00:07:01.860> when<00:07:02.159> you're<00:07:02.279> using<00:07:02.370> it<00:07:02.550> on<00:07:02.669> a<00:07:02.699> PC<00:07:03.090> you

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
PC that when you're using it on a PC you

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.779 
PC that when you're using it on a PC you
can<00:07:03.270> adjust<00:07:03.690> all<00:07:03.900> these<00:07:04.020> things<00:07:04.639> you<00:07:05.639> can

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
can adjust all these things you can

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.939 
can adjust all these things you can
adjust<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.210> steering<00:07:06.419> angle<00:07:06.810> by<00:07:07.020> one<00:07:07.800> degree

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:07.949 
adjust the steering angle by one degree

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.659 
adjust the steering angle by one degree
increments<00:07:08.639> and<00:07:09.080> the<00:07:10.080> same<00:07:10.319> for<00:07:10.770> the<00:07:11.130> force

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
increments and the same for the force

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:17.540 
increments and the same for the force
feedback<00:07:11.909> and<00:07:12.380> vibration<00:07:15.529> so<00:07:16.529> yeah<00:07:17.159> but<00:07:17.430> this

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
feedback and vibration so yeah but this

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.850 
feedback and vibration so yeah but this
is<00:07:17.729> more<00:07:18.029> for<00:07:18.360> someone<00:07:18.690> who<00:07:18.870> is<00:07:19.289> not<00:07:19.469> using<00:07:19.770> it

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
is more for someone who is not using it

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.620 
is more for someone who is not using it
on<00:07:19.919> a<00:07:19.949> PC<00:07:20.370> so<00:07:20.580> you<00:07:20.669> can<00:07:20.819> just<00:07:20.940> force<00:07:21.210> it<00:07:21.419> to

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
on a PC so you can just force it to

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.379 
on a PC so you can just force it to
change<00:07:22.310> for<00:07:23.310> any<00:07:23.460> game<00:07:23.580> like<00:07:23.759> if<00:07:24.090> you're<00:07:24.240> going

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389 
change for any game like if you're going

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.379 
change for any game like if you're going
