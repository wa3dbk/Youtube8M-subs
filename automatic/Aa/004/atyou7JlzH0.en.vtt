00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.330
 good fucked explains how moses cut 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.800
 Windows Xp 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.219
 As you know and extra hours in plantings ago 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.619
 they are a virtual machine 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.209
 because if they do not think I can extract so much if they're super I had so many things 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.929
 planted good let's start 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.099
 we have spoken in current 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.729
 i open the extra program where windows 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 good you have to know that if not from other niches 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.360
 if you in a normal machine you have to enter the lip configuration 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.160
 and then as 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.400
 first cd be the first cd boot system two of those 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.700
 catch the cd 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.000
 I think it's the same way I'm going to be myself 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 good for anyone because otherwise it would be very long 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.520
 well ask us here 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.050
 that if we want to bring windows to recover our neuendorf then to see the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.200
 program good as in this one rejects a key enter 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020
 you know what it is 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 you want to say percent and that if we accept the terms and conditions we use the g8 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.510
 to accept them 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.430
 and it tells us that in which partition we want to install it 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.780
 you have here a partition I suppose 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 I'm going to take advantage to show you how to create two partitions 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 as we read law puts create a partition on the disk not because if not 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.240
 afterwards but to that they press the cec 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.290
 but if it does not and now they pay a partition of 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.680
 nothing stress three rows 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.300
 three miners 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 we eject enter and there we have created 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.920
 let's eliminate it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 spend the night 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 We press the quito is a motion of elaborate 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.730
 we can do the same thing we use c we created it let's see it 6 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.030
 not seven 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.400
 seven thousand mega 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.810
 Well of course windows haiti is to put data 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.529
 we went down with the keyboard we coursed 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.959
 tussam center that we already have the Croats 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.450
 now tells us by stellar windows xp in the partition selects the pressure 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.369
 enter select c 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 should know that if someday I'm going to return stellar windows 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.469
 set the pressure well that they are ready to not erase the data that 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.029
 you have a partition of 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.479
 good show it the ce 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.899
 we mark center 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 team praises us serapio package remedies 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.739
 we press at home 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.909
 if you do what I said before percent bob will be windows 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.999
 look very good 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.759
 and always mark the c 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.509
 wonder wheel side santista is operative 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.309
 to keep the data from the ont of another level without it there will also be 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.769
 said way that nothing 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.999
 It is clear that you should not eliminate or 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.679
 create new partitions 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.989
 in that space I stopped and the monago data cutting it and again 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.859
 we want that we are going to restart the team do not worry will be organized 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.859
 and keep climbing 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.119
 if it is question this 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.629
 do not let it run, it does not date from touch anything 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.629
 and the system keeps working 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.459
 as you see the continuous extraction now will ask us about the parameters 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.989
 what do you need 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 and pockets introducing little by little 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.010
 now he asks us about the general options be regional hundred 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.959
 8 - the next 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.279
 we will not oppose 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.279
 writing point for example 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.040
 the dress code in the serial that you have in your cb oo por 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.739
 under the sticker of your computer or 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 for turret by match where the channels 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.130
 one is introduced the key then still following with a man team from which 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:19.900
 you want 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.389
 efe / javier 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 both signaling the presentation 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.830
 It is important to put the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.999
 because nobody bridge to our system 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.620
 configure in the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.259
 the hour is about 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
 and we continue with this scourge 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.999
 to the question about the conformation of networks we mark scientific sanity 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:47.319
 the fans 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.319
 I did not hide what belongs, we leave it 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.199
 you can change what is mentioned and your work group shows house or whatever you want 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.590
 bonnet a benefit on resignation 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:06.089
 we do not touch anything 15 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 I have windows xp installed 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.969
 as simple as that 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.879
 says it's going to adjust to the best 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.870
 terms 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.169
 we accept 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.169
 and it's loading 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.529
 well, nothing other parliamentarians ask us 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.529
 about who next 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.610
 let's give it back 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.320
 the team while it is decaying automatic 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.069
 this is proven it took tirantas to exploit them 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.919
 updates will illustrate 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.919
 we mark next 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.619
 this step we will omit 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:03.790
 sta 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.599
 and this looks like three thousand pesos 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.039
 good if you want to register register here and if you do not do it at another time 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.680
 we mark nobles at another time we frame following 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.349
 this will be the name that appears as a user 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.830
 let's oppose javier we can create the users already from the beginning 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.830
 click on next 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.139
 what happens to us afp that we have called olano like that 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.689
 we are going to oppose but suÃ¡rez javier 25 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.339
 therefore 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:42.339
 and we finish 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:57.569
 well then the austral shipbuilding argued 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.719
 I hope it's helpful and well you can see more videos on the page 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.259
 little point 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.649
 there you have configurations and so on 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.209
 good please commented points that lived and subscribe or is our channel 

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:11.039
