 patrick's love will work on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.469
 olympic games in sochi 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.289
 true to the time of the hockey tournament 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 Alexey will become a snow leopard but it is already 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289
 not so important because his main dream 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.539
 last three years 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 I realized I will not dissemble after 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.670
 of how it was determined that the Olympiad 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.170
 Sochi will be held and there are dolls when 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 they were presented that is a lot has arisen 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 such a desire which then provided 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.940
 that what I want to be a talisman of funds 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.380
 olympic games here are three and a half 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.380

 portfolio photos from work. there myself 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.489
 themselves made a selection of well and already that is 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.080
 directly organizers all 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.540
 arranged and do not think that work 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.820
 differ greatly from work in the arena 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 tractor since you are solid 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.240
 improvisation is just put 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.950
 certain limits for which it is impossible 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.950
 will come and then you create something wider 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.960
 no ice is allowed because 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.470
 mascot first none in the arena 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.259
 their couple and while there is only talk of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.440
 the tribunes I'm a free guy 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.720
 and 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 but none of the very Windows why you will 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.520
 act not easily polar bear 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.850

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.430
