with tea and whether it's healthy or not
is<00:00:32.850> caffeine<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.020> level<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.500> caffeine

post<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> link<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.960> basically<00:01:10.830> what

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
post a link to that and basically what

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
post a link to that and basically what
he<00:01:11.430> showed<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.940> that<00:01:12.080> um<00:01:14.030> tea<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.720> compared

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
he showed was that um tea when compared

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.760 
he showed was that um tea when compared
to<00:01:16.380> water<00:01:16.620> had<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.700> same<00:01:18.770> diuretic

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to water had about the same diuretic

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
to water had about the same diuretic
effect<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.700> mean<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.490> excreted<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> same

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
effect I mean they excreted the same

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
effect I mean they excreted the same
amount<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.630> no<00:01:25.380> matter<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.800> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
amount of your no matter which way so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.000 
amount of your no matter which way so
it's<00:01:26.370> mostly<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> water<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.290> producing

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
it's mostly the water that was producing

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's mostly the water that was producing
the<00:01:29.130> diuretic<00:01:29.580> effect<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.790> any

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the diuretic effect for that and in any

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.750 
the diuretic effect for that and in any
case<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.410> small<00:01:35.310> doses

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
case when you have it in small doses

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.060 
case when you have it in small doses
like<00:01:36.030> over<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.720> day<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.410> drink<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
like over a day if you drink you know a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.600 
like over a day if you drink you know a
few<00:01:38.280> cups<00:01:38.520> tea<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.830> effects<00:01:41.400> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
few cups tea then the effects are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.630 
few cups tea then the effects are
minimal<00:01:41.940> on<00:01:42.480> them<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.950> diuretic<00:01:44.400> because

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
minimal on them on the diuretic because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
minimal on them on the diuretic because
you're<00:01:44.790> also<00:01:44.940> getting<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> water<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:45.990> with

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you're also getting the water in with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.040 
you're also getting the water in with
the<00:01:46.500> tea<00:01:46.680> okay<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.000> pluses<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.510> minuses<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the tea okay so pluses and minuses to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.770 
the tea okay so pluses and minuses to
caffeine<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> main<00:01:50.520> thing<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.240> tea

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
caffeine but the main thing is that tea

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
caffeine but the main thing is that tea
has<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.650> high<00:01:52.830> level<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.250> antioxidants

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
has a really high level of antioxidants

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
has a really high level of antioxidants
so<00:01:54.870> getting<00:01:55.530> those<00:01:56.900> outweighs<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.530> effects

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so getting those outweighs the effects

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
so getting those outweighs the effects
of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> caffeine<00:01:59.760> as<00:02:00.270> long<00:02:00.510> as<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.810> not

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
of the caffeine as long as you're not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
of the caffeine as long as you're not
having<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> crazy<00:02:02.010> amount<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.150> long<00:02:03.330> as<00:02:03.540> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
having a crazy amount and as long as you

black tea sometimes okay so that brings

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.190 
black tea sometimes okay so that brings
me<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.069> level<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.790> caffeine<00:02:12.600> in<00:02:12.630> different

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
me to the level of caffeine in different

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
me to the level of caffeine in different
types<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.680> tea<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.220> black<00:02:14.460> tea<00:02:14.700> has<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> most

caffeine and
Earl<00:02:16.569> Grey<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.590> type<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:17.920> black<00:02:18.459> tea<00:02:18.700> so

Earl Grey is a type of black tea so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.089 
Earl Grey is a type of black tea so
those<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.150> drink<00:02:19.510> Earl<00:02:19.989> Grey<00:02:20.319> just<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:21.010> aware

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
those you drink Earl Grey just be aware

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.910 
those you drink Earl Grey just be aware
it<00:02:21.459> does<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.510> highest<00:02:22.720> tea<00:02:23.349> level<00:02:23.800> of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
it does have the highest tea level of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.479 
it does have the highest tea level of
caffeine<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.510> has<00:02:26.140> about<00:02:26.319> half<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.310> level

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
caffeine but it has about half the level

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.460 
caffeine but it has about half the level
of<00:02:27.670> coffee<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.780> read<00:02:28.959> something<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.349> said

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
of coffee and I read something that said

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.660 
of coffee and I read something that said
that<00:02:29.739> by<00:02:30.129> weight<00:02:31.019> dry<00:02:32.019> tea<00:02:32.080> has<00:02:33.010> more<00:02:33.430> caffeine

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that by weight dry tea has more caffeine

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.030 
that by weight dry tea has more caffeine
than<00:02:33.910> dry<00:02:34.360> coffee<00:02:34.660> beans<00:02:35.019> but<00:02:35.560> when<00:02:35.739> they<00:02:35.860> get

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
than dry coffee beans but when they get

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.720 
than dry coffee beans but when they get
infused<00:02:36.519> into<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.000> water<00:02:37.530> coffee<00:02:38.730> imparts

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
infused into the water coffee imparts

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.479 
infused into the water coffee imparts
more<00:02:40.000> caffeine<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.780> water<00:02:41.019> then<00:02:41.680> T<00:02:42.220> does

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
more caffeine to the water then T does

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.320 
more caffeine to the water then T does
so<00:02:43.530> again<00:02:44.530> black<00:02:45.099> tea<00:02:45.340> has<00:02:45.549> about<00:02:45.730> half<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
so again black tea has about half the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.320 
so again black tea has about half the
amount<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.569> caffeine<00:02:46.780> as<00:02:47.230> coffee<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:49.150> can

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
amount of caffeine as coffee and you can

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.750 
amount of caffeine as coffee and you can
get<00:02:49.450> black<00:02:50.080> tea<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> bags<00:02:50.830> or<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.610> get

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
get black tea in the bags or you can get

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.640 
get black tea in the bags or you can get
it<00:02:51.880> loose<00:02:52.180> which<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.989> kind<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.200> fun<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.440> can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
it loose which is kind of fun you can

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.009 
it loose which is kind of fun you can
put<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.099> little<00:02:54.250> metal<00:02:54.970> ball<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.660> infuse

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
put it in a little metal ball and infuse

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.530 
put it in a little metal ball and infuse
it<00:02:56.140> into<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.530> teapot<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.910> also<00:02:58.209> get

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it into your teapot you can also get

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.319 
it into your teapot you can also get
black<00:02:58.810> tea<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.560> decaffeinated<00:03:00.549> so

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
black tea that is decaffeinated so

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.479 
black tea that is decaffeinated so
that's<00:03:01.510> another<00:03:01.870> option<00:03:02.200> although<00:03:02.799> i<00:03:03.250> don't

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
that's another option although i don't

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.970 
that's another option although i don't
know<00:03:03.790> about<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.360> process<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:05.349> decaffeinated

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
know about the process for decaffeinated

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.030 
know about the process for decaffeinated
tea<00:03:07.019> sometimes<00:03:08.019> they<00:03:08.170> use<00:03:08.290> chemicals<00:03:08.799> and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
tea sometimes they use chemicals and

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.490 
tea sometimes they use chemicals and
that's<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:10.150> great<00:03:10.480> i'd<00:03:10.810> probably<00:03:11.049> take

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that's not that great i'd probably take

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.190 
that's not that great i'd probably take
caffeine<00:03:11.829> over<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.640> chemicals<00:03:13.150> depending<00:03:14.049> on

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
caffeine over the chemicals depending on

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.199 
caffeine over the chemicals depending on
on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.099> process<00:03:16.260> ok<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.440> then<00:03:17.500> green<00:03:17.920> tea<00:03:18.250> you

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
on the process ok and then green tea you

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
on the process ok and then green tea you
can<00:03:19.360> also<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.959> bags<00:03:20.319> or<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.310> get

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
can also get in bags or you can get

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.390 
can also get in bags or you can get
loose<00:03:21.930> green<00:03:22.930> tea<00:03:23.200> has<00:03:23.230> about<00:03:23.769> half<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
loose green tea has about half the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.360 
loose green tea has about half the
caffeine<00:03:24.819> black<00:03:25.389> tea<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.590> about<00:03:26.739> quarter<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
caffeine black tea so about quarter the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.379 
caffeine black tea so about quarter the
caffeine<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:28.030> coffee<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.430> green<00:03:30.790> but

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
caffeine of coffee and it is green but

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.000 
caffeine of coffee and it is green but
it's<00:03:31.569> kind<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.959> dark<00:03:32.170> green<00:03:32.470> because<00:03:32.859> it's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it's kind of a dark green because it's

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.870 
it's kind of a dark green because it's
dried<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:35.100> another<00:03:36.100> big<00:03:36.370> difference<00:03:36.790> between

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
dried and another big difference between

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.080 
dried and another big difference between
green<00:03:37.359> tea<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.870> black<00:03:38.019> tea<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.489> they

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
green tea and black tea is that they

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.970 
green tea and black tea is that they
come<00:03:40.269> from<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:40.450> same<00:03:40.690> plant<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.560> tea<00:03:41.739> plant

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
come from the same plant the tea plant

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.479 
come from the same plant the tea plant
but<00:03:42.880> um<00:03:43.230> green<00:03:44.230> tea<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:45.480> not<00:03:46.920> oxidized<00:03:47.920> as<00:03:48.190> much

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
but um green tea is not oxidized as much

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.240 
but um green tea is not oxidized as much
as<00:03:48.700> black<00:03:49.120> tea<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.350> green<00:03:50.590> tea<00:03:50.799> has<00:03:50.829> more

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
as black tea so the green tea has more

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.030 
as black tea so the green tea has more
antioxidants<00:03:51.579> left<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.139> more<00:03:53.440> benefits

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
antioxidants left in it so more benefits

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.759 
antioxidants left in it so more benefits
in<00:03:54.310> green<00:03:54.609> tea<00:03:54.850> plus<00:03:55.209> less<00:03:55.510> caffeine<00:03:55.810> so

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
in green tea plus less caffeine so

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.160 
in green tea plus less caffeine so
that's<00:03:56.950> usually<00:03:57.459> my<00:03:57.670> choice<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:59.049> an

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
that's usually my choice that or an

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.309 
that's usually my choice that or an
herbal<00:03:59.590> tea<00:03:59.769> which<00:04:00.489> has<00:04:00.730> no<00:04:01.000> caffeine<00:04:01.319> it's

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
herbal tea which has no caffeine it's

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.339 
herbal tea which has no caffeine it's
made<00:04:03.040> from<00:04:03.430> different<00:04:03.940> plants<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.139> can<00:04:05.230> be

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
made from different plants so it can be

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.199 
made from different plants so it can be
made<00:04:05.500> from<00:04:05.530> pretty<00:04:05.859> much<00:04:06.010> anything<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:07.030> one

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
made from pretty much anything this one

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.440 
made from pretty much anything this one
is<00:04:07.359> rose<00:04:07.630> hips<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.940> some<00:04:09.940> type<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> dried

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
is rose hips and some type of dried

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.970
