00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the past few days works been pretty

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.709 
the past few days works been pretty
hectic<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.100> don't<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.460> allowed<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.510> talk

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
hectic I don't think I'm allowed to talk

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
hectic I don't think I'm allowed to talk
about<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.920> gonna<00:00:41.309> leave<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
about it so we're gonna leave it at that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.569 
about it so we're gonna leave it at that
okay<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:44.059> ACR<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:46.260> been<00:00:46.500> confirmed<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.370> be

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
okay so ACR it has been confirmed to be

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.680 
okay so ACR it has been confirmed to be
the<00:00:47.910> best<00:00:48.090> gun<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> game<00:00:49.489> with<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.820> little

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the best gun in the game with the little

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
the best gun in the game with the little
recoil<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:53.210> really<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.390> fire<00:00:54.660> rate<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.760> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
recoil a really good fire rate and just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
recoil a really good fire rate and just
a<00:00:56.879> sheer<00:00:57.210> accuracy<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.350> I'll

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a sheer accuracy of the thing I'll

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
a sheer accuracy of the thing I'll
usually<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.760> hitting<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.359> twenty<00:01:01.140> percent

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
usually be hitting a twenty percent

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
usually be hitting a twenty percent
accuracy<00:01:02.699> which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> pretty<00:01:03.989> much<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.439> most

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
accuracy which is pretty much what most

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
accuracy which is pretty much what most
people<00:01:05.010> are<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> three

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
people are going to get with the three

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
people are going to get with the three
round<00:01:07.200> burst<00:01:07.770> weapons<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.630> goes<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> speak

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
round burst weapons so it goes to speak

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.520 
round burst weapons so it goes to speak
for<00:01:10.409> itself<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.229> don't<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
for itself it's the most I don't want to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.880 
for itself it's the most I don't want to
say<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> most<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.750> if<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> most<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
say the most but if not the most one of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370 
say the most but if not the most one of
the<00:01:17.040> most<00:01:17.130> accurate<00:01:17.670> machine<00:01:18.479> guns<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the most accurate machine guns in the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.490 
the most accurate machine guns in the
game<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:20.549> far<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.090> fully<00:01:21.659> automatic<00:01:22.200> goes<00:01:22.350> at

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
game as far as fully automatic goes at

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
game as far as fully automatic goes at
least<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.900> will<00:01:25.220> usually<00:01:26.220> throw<00:01:26.909> kick<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
least I will usually throw kick on it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.469 
least I will usually throw kick on it
just<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> add<00:01:28.650> insult<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> injury<00:01:29.479> because

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
just to add insult to injury because

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
just to add insult to injury because
it's<00:01:30.780> already<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.130> low<00:01:32.369> recoil<00:01:32.729> you're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's already so low recoil you're

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
it's already so low recoil you're
essentially<00:01:33.900> shooting<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> laser

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
essentially shooting them with a laser

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.899 
essentially shooting them with a laser
beam<00:01:35.750> because<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> laser<00:01:38.640> beam

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
beam because you know how a laser beam

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
beam because you know how a laser beam
would<00:01:39.060> shoot<00:01:39.329> obviously<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.079> there'd<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.409> no

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
would shoot obviously like there'd be no

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
would shoot obviously like there'd be no
recoil<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> listed<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.210> sort<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> giant

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
recoil on that listed some sort of giant

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.499 
recoil on that listed some sort of giant
galactic<00:01:43.710> laser<00:01:43.920> beam<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
galactic laser beam but we're just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
galactic laser beam but we're just
talking<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.140> laser<00:01:46.350> beam<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.189> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
talking little laser beam here so it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
talking little laser beam here so it's
essentially<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.570> shooting<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.170> small<00:01:49.439> laser

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
essentially like shooting a small laser

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
essentially like shooting a small laser
beam<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.509> die<00:01:51.720> within

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
beam at people and they just die within

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.429 
beam at people and they just die within
a<00:01:52.500> second<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> half<00:01:53.399> here's<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.630> spring

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a second and a half here's some spring

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.160 
a second and a half here's some spring
for<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.829> guys<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:57.719> couldn't<00:01:57.899> see

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
for you guys and I really couldn't see

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.609 
for you guys and I really couldn't see
the<00:01:58.290> guy<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.689> that<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.350> wasn't

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the guy at the time so that it wasn't

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.870 
the guy at the time so that it wasn't
the<00:02:01.680> most<00:02:01.799> beautiful<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> world<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the most beautiful thing in the world I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.680 
the most beautiful thing in the world I
know

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
know

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.719 
know
no<00:02:03.870> uh<00:02:04.940> easier<00:02:05.940> back<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.750> ACR<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
no uh easier back to the ACR I I was a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.600 
no uh easier back to the ACR I I was a
pretty<00:02:09.180> nice<00:02:09.420> shot<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:11.220> quite

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
pretty nice shot with this I'm quite

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.290 
pretty nice shot with this I'm quite
proud<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.880> myself<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.900> seer<00:02:13.790> there's<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.060> no

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
proud of myself a seer there's really no

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.660 
proud of myself a seer there's really no
point<00:02:15.510> I'm<00:02:15.690> putting<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.080> red<00:02:16.290> dawn<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.830> just

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
point I'm putting a red dawn on it just
