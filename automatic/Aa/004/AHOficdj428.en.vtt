 It is the finish of velvet 8 This was pitch painful 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.000
 Though there is a little useless in ivory 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.590
 2 celtic real one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.549
 But I almost do not feel lame 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 It is a type but it is different from the mat 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:24.509
 I am bored with transparency and I like it very much 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.240
 This really highlights the natural neem book so it is a highlight or base 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.100

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.870
 It is oil 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 This is because pearl works well so I 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:07.200
 I often use it for tear bags that are 8 mega 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 If you think that it is very beautiful even based on this and you like makeup with a pearly feel 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.410
 Very easy to use 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:27.770
 The next is extensive pink 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.550
 8This is a type of texture of Bellax Pearl, with a rather fine pearl . 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.360

 I heard pick about feeling 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.820
 I think there is 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.710
 Because it is a color that can feel quite various nuances 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:54.920
 You can either tighten the diameter It is good to tighten in response bolt 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:57.030
 It is also very good to put this on the entire eyelid and make a natural makeup 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.410
 It is favorite 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 I think it's not so dark siro, so here too 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.800

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.410
 Though it has a one sparkling sense of whether the pearl say lame 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:25.450
 Hate so much when actually put on the skin 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:29.940
 I do not feel 8 as this is a color 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.650
 It becomes the light gram of the gold series 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.040
 8 This is a pre-useful color 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.190
 In the case of natural makeup, put this on the hollow part 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.550
 Or to the base color when the smash makeup 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.450
 As you can use even Mayo afterward 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.260

 For those who do eye makeup with a good patience 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.599
