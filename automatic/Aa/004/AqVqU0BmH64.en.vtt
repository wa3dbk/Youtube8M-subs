00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.839
 hello and welcome for our test 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 produced then in this video I'm going 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.469
 test the web app link of angie nutrition 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 for those who do not know her I 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.410
 the trie science a french brand 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 which respect among others the standard of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 production will work and that offers 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.620
 milk proteins so to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.030
 differentiate cheese proteins 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.350
 that we can hold other brands of 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.330
 milk proteins are costing a no 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 nature and therefore more interesting 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.020
 sir more efficient let's say for 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.969
 simplify while here we are on a 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.339
 drowned concentrate so a mesh 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 basic protein in quotation marks then 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.239
 in terms of dosage we're going to have 60 18 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.670
 2% protein which gives the ages 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.019
 earlier for us is to focus my 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 good thoughts also that the dosage it is 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.559
 variable on perfumes 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.289
 here I am on a fruit scent that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.179
 is apricot peach mango which is good 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.499
 dosed but do not forget that on all 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.059
 protein brands generally 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.589
 that you take two perfumes it is by 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.749
 example the chocolate you are going to have a 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.719
 little bit less protein so 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.850
 then it is 6.2 percent carbohydrate 5 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 5% of lipids so here it all to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.660
 classical fact then after in terms of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 differentiating point without this product there 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.050
 we will also find an addition of a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.690
 tens of vitamins and minerals that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.400
 are better dosed and after we had 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.080
 need three complexes three 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 amino acid complexes then the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.270
 first it'll be 325 mg with a 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.070
 mixture of drinking a year of carnitine and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.770
 of glutamine so that could be 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.790
 interesting but 325 mg per 100 g of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.050
 wade 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.220
 it really makes our ages that is weak 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.790
 so there I do not see too much interest 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.910
 the same then 250 mg of a mixture 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500
 of taurian dorny tinÃ©e tyrosine that 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 could also be interesting but 250 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.240
 mg there too it stays in pink at 12 o'clock too 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 weak to be interesting and finally 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.900
 last complex 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 if a 140 mg complex with 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.010
 insulation efta the syn and efta 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 therefore validates a particular form of 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.290
 CAAP but 140 mg per 100 g powder 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.050
 there is also 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.250
 very relevant so these three complexes 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.540
 there for me they have not really 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.310
 of interest in this product I will join 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.620
 rather the fact that we are on a dosage 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.150
 interesting in dairy protein and 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.610
 then with the addition of vitamin and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.229
 minerals rather well dosed then 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.470
 now we will do a little bit the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.170
 perfume and taste test so I said 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.030
 on a fruit scent so peach mango 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.320
 apricot and I can tell you that when 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.360
 day the pot that's really good 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.720
 so I hope you are going to be as good 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.790
 Closer then I m an pods 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.970
 twenty grams in 200 billion 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.970
 euros 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.200
 so I did not mix a lot I 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.150
 no lumps the walls are clean 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.709
 I have a little bit of foam but 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.940
 very very light and who is in the process of 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.940
 decrease rather a good mixture 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.400
 ah yeah real taste makes it beautiful 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.560
 redhead herself that smell in the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.709
 nice round wood really very good it's 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.540
 super good common like perfume I think 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.230
 as for summer or as little sassafras 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.040
 near what to make a drink 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.540
 refreshing 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 it really gives a cushion ground 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.380
 so to summarize on the points 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.090
 positive of this product we have a good 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.790
 dosage to concentrate a good dosage 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 in dairy proteins with an added 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.239
 vitamins and minerals that are well 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.750
 dosed also a product that is a good 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.370
 mixed 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.500
 and then here a group there really 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.640
 very very good so now if this test 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.080
 you liked invites you to do a little 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 green chick on youtube that makes 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.140
 always pleasure and especially remember 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.610
 not to subscribe to our channel for 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.850
 do not stop our future video at 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.850
