00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.489
 to intestinal cleansing 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.390
 According to experts, most of the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.290
 health disorders are a consequence 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.270
 of a toxic colon because simply 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.250
 because the tradition of eating and drinking 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.119
 meals loaded with condoms 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.579
 chemical white flour sugar fat 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.030
 mucous foods that are products 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.219
 milk derivatives tobacco alcohol and still 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.500
 the air we breathe causes a 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.100
 accumulation of stagnant fecal matter 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.589
 in the intestinal tract the colon is a 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.749
 drainage system but by negligence 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.780
 and abuse becomes a dumpster 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:52.870
 when it's clean and normal we're fine 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 and happy let it stagnate and distill 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.129
 poisons fermentation and rot 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.429
 poisoning the brain and the system 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.920
 nervous the heart the lungs and the 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.580
 blood the digestive organs in order 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.680

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.530

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.560

 wise colon up here a piece of 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.740
 meat rots faster in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170

 It brings hormones that can cause 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.720
 problems and hormonal imbalances in your 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.090

 intestinal cleansing little by little is 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 committing suicide 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.340
 the accumulation of fecal matter can 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900
 cause a state of putrefaction that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.340
 It can result in many diseases 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 like diabetes inflammation of the liver 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.780
 fatigue, overweight, constipation 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.740

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.400
 doctor john christopher scientist 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.040
 international and author of several books 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.739
 of nutrition states that most 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.440
 the diseases are the result of 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.440
 intoxication and deficiencies in the body 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.560
 I'm going to tell you what happened to me 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.110
 about 10 years ago I found myself 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.840
 me in a bad state of health like many 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.180
 of you are now I was 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.330
 losing the hair had the belly 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.940
 big dark circles I smelled my feet not 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.560
 it matters how many times I bathed I had 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.660
 inflammation of the liver 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.120
 I felt weak that already for the three of 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.340
 the afternoon I sat in an armchair and I 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.670
 I slept for two or three hours without wanting to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.310
 do nothing then I did what many 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.830
 they call my doctor and immediately 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.530
 he put me in the hospital to make me 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.480
 a series of exams after three 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.900
 days of putting needles out of blood 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.880
 take x-rays and so on doctors 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.280
 they informed me that they had found me 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.470
 a problem with the colon and that within 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.640
 six weeks they thought to make me one 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.610
 colostomy 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.880
 or cut me from 12 to 16 inches of 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.340
 disappointed colon I went to my house and 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.980
 one afternoon two days later I thought about 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.290
 kill me but thanks to a friend who 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.340
 he knew about my problem he recommended me 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.910
 I did a clean 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.280
 intestinal for the moment I did not believe him no 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.609
 she was a doctor and she was also a woman and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 they know women however she very 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.410
 smart recognizing me stupidity 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.870
 insisted that visiting a doctor from 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.150
 naturopathy and the conscious of my 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.960
 problem recommended me a cleaning 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.479
 intestinal 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.100
 I followed his instructions doing the 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.100
 intestinal cleansing 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.169
 almost immediately I began to evacuate 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.600
 discarding a black and very 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.979
 stinky that I felt like 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.590
 to vomit 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.900
 that's how it went every day three and four 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.620
 times to the bathroom and little by little I started 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.810
 feel better I started losing weight 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.150
 my stomach went down the spots on the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.150
 face and dark circles disappeared 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.910
 the inflammation of the liver went away and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.100
 I lost two inches from the waist 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.889
 introduce myself to the hospital six weeks 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.510
 later for the operation I insisted that 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.660
 the doctors again take me 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.600
 X-rays and other tests or I was not going to 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.700
 let them cut me though they did not want 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.520
 finally they did it well 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.070
 with great surprise that he had the most color 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.920
 clean and healthy that they had never seen and 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.280
 that as a consequence I did not need the 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.860
 operation a few days later I went to 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.200
 study with the doctor of naturopathy and 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.510
 I saw many people with my own eyes 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.450
 had been removed from the injections of 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.640
 insulin that people with paralysis were walking 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.030
 people with cancer had healed 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.650
 etcetera in reality we are not only what 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.250
 what we eat but also what 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.250
 let's say and eliminate remember not everything 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.750
 what goes in comes out you have to remember that 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.350
 everything we eat we have to 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.320
 digest it and eliminate it within 24 to 32 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.270
 hours chronic constipation increases 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.950
 the risk of cancer in the breast of the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.450
 woman 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.790
 remember that the body does not heal unless 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.950
 that is clean inside throw him 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.740
 medicines and food to a dirty body 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.140
 it's like eating from a dirty dish on 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.860
 famous doctor bill ayers a remarkable 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.170
 Colon specialist says the following 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.360
 in my opinion there is only one 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.849
 disease and that disease 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.159
 is the self intoxication the body 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.139
 poisoning if to itself is the 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.479
 crap our system that kills us 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.969
 I'm convinced that unless you 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.000
 cleanse your colon you will never enjoy 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.370
 good health we are like a car you do not 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.129
 I would buy a new car and never change 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.960
 the oil then because you do not 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.319
 It also makes an oil change to your 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.629
 remember organism no matter how many 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.030
 sometimes we see the car on the outside if not 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:55.969
 we change the oil to the engine with the 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.279
 time that engine is going to upset itself 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:01.159
 same is with our body all the 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:03.259
 days to get up we bathe ourselves clean 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:05.629
 the body on the outside but we never know 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:09.400
 it happens to clean it inside and there it is 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.400
 the detail as cantinflas used to say
