it<00:00:40.899> you<00:00:41.230> don't<00:00:41.410> realize<00:00:41.770> it's<00:00:41.980> in<00:00:42.100> your<00:00:42.250> pocket

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.150 
it you don't realize it's in your pocket
the<00:00:43.480> clip<00:00:43.809> is<00:00:44.020> substantial<00:00:44.680> it's<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.890> little

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
the clip is substantial it's a little

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.000 
the clip is substantial it's a little
hard<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.520> get<00:00:45.670> into<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:46.120> pocket<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.559> once<00:00:47.829> it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
hard to get into a pocket but once it's

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.349 
hard to get into a pocket but once it's
in<00:00:48.160> there<00:00:48.399> it's<00:00:48.550> kind<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:48.820> tough<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.180> get<00:00:49.300> out

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
in there it's kind of tough to get out

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.840 
in there it's kind of tough to get out
I'm<00:00:49.690> glad<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.930> put<00:00:50.320> this<00:00:50.500> loop<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:50.890> 550<00:00:51.460> cord<00:00:51.640> on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
I'm glad I put this loop a 550 cord on

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.060 
I'm glad I put this loop a 550 cord on
it<00:00:52.420> really<00:00:52.629> makes<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.079> little<00:00:53.500> more<00:00:53.649> easy<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
it really makes it a little more easy to

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.099 
it really makes it a little more easy to
get<00:00:54.190> out<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.519> pocket<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.840> little

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
get out of the pocket it's a little

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.860 
get out of the pocket it's a little
sharp<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:57.370> not<00:00:57.519> used<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.030> SOG<00:00:58.570> sharp

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100

another<00:01:36.689> SOG<00:01:37.689> pocket<00:01:38.079> knife<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> much

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
another SOG pocket knife with a much

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.580 
another SOG pocket knife with a much
different<00:01:39.970> style<00:01:40.210> clip<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.259> one<00:01:41.439> was

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
different style clip and this one was

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.289 
different style clip and this one was
much<00:01:41.740> nicer<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.280> did<00:01:42.430> bend<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.790> little<00:01:42.909> bit<00:01:43.030> but

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
much nicer it did bend a little bit but

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.550 
much nicer it did bend a little bit but
it<00:01:43.360> was<00:01:43.390> much<00:01:43.600> easier<00:01:43.630> getting<00:01:44.229> out<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
it was much easier getting out of a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.910 
it was much easier getting out of a
pocket<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:45.610> was<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.820> little<00:01:45.909> tighter<00:01:46.920> there

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
pocket so it was a little tighter there

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.770 
pocket so it was a little tighter there
was<00:01:48.040> no<00:01:48.130> place<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.369> put<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.729> piece<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:48.969> 550<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.719> I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
was no place to put a piece of 550 and I

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.179 
was no place to put a piece of 550 and I
would<00:01:49.930> have<00:01:50.020> liked<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.200> remove<00:01:50.649> this<00:01:50.860> clip

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
would have liked to remove this clip

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.010 
would have liked to remove this clip
even<00:01:51.850> though<00:01:52.030> I'd<00:01:52.149> rather<00:01:52.329> carry<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.840> knife

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
even though I'd rather carry a knife

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.160 
even though I'd rather carry a knife
like<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.159> with<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.030> blade<00:01:55.570> down<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
like this with the blade down in the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.109 
like this with the blade down in the
pocket<00:01:56.380> with<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.070> clip<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.790> opposite

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119

the assisted opening is nice it's a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.809 
the assisted opening is nice it's a
little<00:02:18.750> scary<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.230> public<00:02:19.650> kind<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> likes<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
little scary in public kind of likes it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.860 
little scary in public kind of likes it
look<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.180> you're<00:02:21.330> opening<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
look like you're opening up a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.920 
look like you're opening up a
switchblade<00:02:22.849> even<00:02:23.849> though<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.330> open<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
switchblade even though you can open it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.870 
switchblade even though you can open it
without<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.410> auto<00:02:25.560> assist<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.730> how

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
without the auto assist you know how

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180 
without the auto assist you know how
often<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> bring<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:28.319> hands<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> knife

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
often do you bring two hands to a knife

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.610 
often do you bring two hands to a knife
so<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.300> little<00:02:30.480> awkward<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.230> bring<00:02:31.380> out

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so it's a little awkward to bring out

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
so it's a little awkward to bring out
slowly<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:33.180> does<00:02:33.330> look<00:02:33.569> pretty

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
slowly and it does look pretty

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.130 
slowly and it does look pretty
aggressive<00:02:34.440> no<00:02:35.220> matter<00:02:35.400> what<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.019> other

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
aggressive no matter what so the other

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.440 
aggressive no matter what so the other
problem<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> auto<00:02:38.099> auto<00:02:38.670> assist<00:02:39.209> is

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
problem with the auto auto assist is

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
problem with the auto auto assist is
that<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.170> bring<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> closed<00:02:41.099> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
that you have to bring it closed you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.339 
that you have to bring it closed you
have<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.790> push<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.180> against<00:02:42.480> something<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.200> get

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
have to push it against something to get

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.920 
have to push it against something to get
it<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.060> tried<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> lot<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:47.510> try<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.569> clip

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it going I tried a lot to try to clip

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
it going I tried a lot to try to clip
flip<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.440> closed<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:50.250> wouldn't

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
flip it closed and it just wouldn't

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.340 
flip it closed and it just wouldn't
happen<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.209> spring<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:51.959> too<00:02:52.080> tight

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
happen the spring is a little too tight

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.470 
happen the spring is a little too tight
so<00:02:53.959> those<00:02:54.959> are<00:02:55.080> my<00:02:55.140> disadvantages<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
so those are my disadvantages with it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.759 
so those are my disadvantages with it
otherwise<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.170> great<00:02:58.290> knife<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
otherwise I think it's a great knife it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.309 
otherwise I think it's a great knife it
