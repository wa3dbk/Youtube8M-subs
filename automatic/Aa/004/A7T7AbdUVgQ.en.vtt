question today have you ever noticed
that<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.160> sometimes<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.360> same<00:00:15.720> exact

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
that you sometimes have the same exact

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.679 
that you sometimes have the same exact
note<00:00:16.679> written<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.279> same<00:00:17.580> time<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.210> both

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
note written at the same time in both

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.800 
note written at the same time in both
hands<00:00:19.050> that's<00:00:19.769> right<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.519> can<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.849> be<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
hands that's right how can this be so

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
hands that's right how can this be so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
I'm going to show you why first of all

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.909 
I'm going to show you why first of all
and<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.599> to<00:00:24.659> handle<00:00:24.960> such<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.349> thing<00:00:25.679> I'm

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
and how to handle such a thing I'm

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.290 
and how to handle such a thing I'm
wondering<00:00:26.399> how<00:00:26.789> many<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.999> you<00:00:27.149> have

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
wondering how many of you have

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.569 
wondering how many of you have
experienced<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.169> in<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.619> music<00:00:29.099> I'd<00:00:29.279> love

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
experienced this in your music I'd love

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.700 
experienced this in your music I'd love
to<00:00:29.669> hear<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.300> I've<00:00:30.929> taken<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> example

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to hear from you I've taken the example

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.460 
to hear from you I've taken the example
today<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:33.090> two-part<00:00:33.930> invention<00:00:34.050> of

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
today of the first two-part invention of

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.040 
today of the first two-part invention of
Johann<00:00:34.680> Sebastian<00:00:34.710> Bach<00:00:35.250> now<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> good

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Johann Sebastian Bach now this is a good

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.920 
Johann Sebastian Bach now this is a good
example<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.160> clearly<00:00:38.550> shows<00:00:39.060> why

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
example that really clearly shows why

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900 
example that really clearly shows why
composers<00:00:40.830> will<00:00:41.100> write<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.400> same<00:00:41.640> note<00:00:41.880> in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
composers will write the same note in

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.960 
composers will write the same note in
both<00:00:42.300> hands<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.590> reason<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.580> the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
both hands the reason for it is the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.870 
both hands the reason for it is the
counterpoint<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.990> this<00:00:46.380> case<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.310> well

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
counterpoint in this case it's very well

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.670 
counterpoint in this case it's very well
delineated<00:00:48.330> because<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.290> two-part

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
delineated because the two-part

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970 
delineated because the two-part
inventions<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.220> simply<00:00:50.790> two<00:00:51.540> parts<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
inventions are simply two parts that is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.710 
inventions are simply two parts that is
there<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.579> never<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.970> than<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.510> notes

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
there are never more than two notes

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.270 
there are never more than two notes
playing<00:00:54.990> at<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> same<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.650> there<00:00:56.130> are<00:00:56.160> two

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
playing at the same time there are two

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
playing at the same time there are two
separate<00:00:56.790> melodies<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.540> may<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.750> familiar

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
separate melodies you may be familiar

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.420 
separate melodies you may be familiar
with<00:00:58.290> this<00:00:58.470> invention<00:00:58.800> here's<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.310> beginning

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
with this invention here's the beginning

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.270 
with this invention here's the beginning
of<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.529 

so<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> notice<00:01:08.640> each<00:01:08.850> hand<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> playing<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
so you notice each hand is playing a

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.690 
so you notice each hand is playing a
separate<00:01:09.869> melody<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.439> somehow<00:01:10.829> with<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
separate melody but somehow with the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.480 
separate melody but somehow with the
genius<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.479> Bach<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> works<00:01:13.859> together

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
genius of Bach the it works together

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.669 
genius of Bach the it works together
there's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.969> cat<00:01:15.149> apis<00:01:15.659> tree<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.200> melodies

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
there's a cat apis tree of melodies

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.849 
there's a cat apis tree of melodies
later<00:01:17.579> music<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> bach<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.929> music<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> Bach<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
later music a bach other music of Bach I

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.190 
later music a bach other music of Bach I
should<00:01:20.039> say<00:01:20.219> has<00:01:20.819> three<00:01:21.360> four<00:01:21.780> even<00:01:22.170> five

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
should say has three four even five

should say has three four even five
voice<00:01:22.979> fugues<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.969> imagine<00:01:24.179> with<00:01:24.959> your

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
voice fugues can you imagine with your

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
voice fugues can you imagine with your
ten<00:01:25.380> fingers<00:01:25.860> negotiating<00:01:26.789> five<00:01:27.030> separate

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
ten fingers negotiating five separate

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.980 
ten fingers negotiating five separate
lines<00:01:28.289> all<00:01:28.679> doing<00:01:29.219> their<00:01:29.399> own<00:01:29.429> thing<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
lines all doing their own thing that's a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
lines all doing their own thing that's a
subject<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.530> another<00:01:31.649> video<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.459> you<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
subject for another video for you in the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.889 
subject for another video for you in the
two-part<00:01:33.810> though<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.549> why<00:01:36.149> he

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
two-part though we can really see why he

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.080 
two-part though we can really see why he
does<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.860> why<00:01:38.069> you'd<00:01:38.250> write<00:01:38.520> both<00:01:38.759> notes

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
does this and why you'd write both notes

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.839 
does this and why you'd write both notes
I'm<00:01:39.599> gonna<00:01:39.810> call<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.200> attention<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.829> bar<00:01:41.069> 13

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
I'm gonna call your attention to bar 13

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.969 
I'm gonna call your attention to bar 13
he's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> beautiful<00:01:42.989> example<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.649> gonna<00:01:43.739> play

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
he's a beautiful example I'm gonna play

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.339 
he's a beautiful example I'm gonna play
each<00:01:44.250> part<00:01:44.789> separately<00:01:45.209> first<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> can

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
each part separately first so you can

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.649 
each part separately first so you can
hear<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.770> Bach<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.219> writing<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.509> they

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hear what Bach is writing and how they

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.419 
hear what Bach is writing and how they
he'll<00:01:48.959> rise<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.379> this<00:01:49.500> counterpoint<00:01:50.039> the

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
he'll rise of this counterpoint the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.300 
he'll rise of this counterpoint the
right<00:01:50.610> end<00:01:50.789> has<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.710 

and<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.290> actually<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.150> ninth<00:01:59.150> the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
and it's the actually the ninth the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.539 
and it's the actually the ninth the
eighth<00:01:59.869> note<00:02:00.229> that<00:02:00.830> I'm<00:02:01.100> calling<00:02:01.430> your

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
eighth note that I'm calling your

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.820 
eighth note that I'm calling your
attention<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.060> e<00:02:04.780> all<00:02:05.780> right<00:02:06.080> now<00:02:06.440> what<00:02:06.740> is

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
attention to the e all right now what is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.510 
attention to the e all right now what is
the<00:02:06.860> left<00:02:07.159> hand<00:02:07.430> doing<00:02:07.729> left<00:02:08.330> hand<00:02:08.509> has<00:02:08.929> this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.850 

so<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:15.570> same<00:02:15.930> note<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
so if I play up to that same note in the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.140 
so if I play up to that same note in the
left<00:02:17.040> hand<00:02:17.220> you'll<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.550> exactly<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
left hand you'll see it's exactly the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.470 
left hand you'll see it's exactly the
same<00:02:18.330> e<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.140> third<00:02:19.620> beat<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.270> play

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
same e on that third beat so if we play

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.540 
same e on that third beat so if we play
the<00:02:27.600> hands<00:02:27.840> together<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.370> actually

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the hands together you would actually

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.880 
the hands together you would actually
have<00:02:29.910> both<00:02:30.090> fingers<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.930> E

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.970 

well<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.720> don't<00:02:36.930> actually<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> play<00:02:37.800> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
well you don't actually have to play it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.180 
well you don't actually have to play it
with<00:02:38.100> both<00:02:38.310> hands<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.780> secret<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
with both hands that is this secret the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640 
with both hands that is this secret the
reason<00:02:41.730> why<00:02:41.850> composers<00:02:42.510> put<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.230> notes<00:02:43.440> in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
reason why composers put the notes in

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.370 
reason why composers put the notes in
both<00:02:43.860> hands<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> show<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
both hands is to show you the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.510 
both hands is to show you the
sensibilities<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.770> when<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.010> play<00:02:47.310> it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
sensibilities so that when you play it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.720 
sensibilities so that when you play it
you'll<00:02:48.110> hear<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> connection<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.010> each<00:02:50.310> voice

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you'll hear the connection of each voice

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.000 
you'll hear the connection of each voice
in<00:02:51.120> your<00:02:51.330> head<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.320> make<00:02:52.560> sure<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.890> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
in your head so you make sure that that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.450 
in your head so you make sure that that
note<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:54.120> read<00:02:54.750> already<00:02:54.900> part<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.860> both

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
note is a read already part of both

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.510 
note is a read already part of both
lines<00:02:57.300> listen<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> together<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.430> if

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
lines listen to it together and see if

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.870 
lines listen to it together and see if
you<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.910> hear<00:03:00.330> how<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.140> e<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.950> contained

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you can hear how that e is contained

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.910 
you can hear how that e is contained
within<00:03:03.120> both<00:03:03.630> voices<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.560> two<00:03:04.770> people

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
within both voices just like two people

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.520 
within both voices just like two people
were<00:03:05.160> singing<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.820> at<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.480> point<00:03:06.510> both<00:03:07.050> sang

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
were singing and at one point both sang

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.250 
were singing and at one point both sang
the<00:03:07.709> same<00:03:07.950> note<00:03:08.220> here's<00:03:09.090> how<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.360> sounds<00:03:14.480> if<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the same note here's how it sounds if I

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.550 
the same note here's how it sounds if I
stop<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.980> e<00:03:17.280> you'll<00:03:17.640> hear

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.050 

so<00:03:22.560> hopefully<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:23.100> could<00:03:23.220> hear<00:03:23.459> how<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.820> E

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
so hopefully you could hear how that E

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
so hopefully you could hear how that E
is<00:03:24.090> part<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.630> both<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.170> top<00:03:25.350> voice<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
is part of both the top voice in the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.800 
is part of both the top voice in the
bottom<00:03:26.340> voice<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.880> again<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.360> play<00:03:27.540> through

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
bottom voice and again to play through

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.240 
bottom voice and again to play through
the<00:03:27.870> measure<00:03:28.110> here's<00:03:28.530> how<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.770> sounds<00:03:29.100> put

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the measure here's how it sounds put

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.800 
the measure here's how it sounds put
together

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.240 

now<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.140> one<00:03:36.470> example<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.220> very

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
very clear example of how the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.190 
very clear example of how the
counterpoint<00:03:40.160> necessitates<00:03:40.910> both<00:03:41.390> ends<00:03:41.870> have

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
counterpoint necessitates both ends have

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.690 
counterpoint necessitates both ends have
paying<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.560> same<00:03:42.770> note<00:03:42.980> at<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.190> same<00:03:43.370> time

on<00:04:07.819> in<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.000> counterpoint<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:09.019> that's<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
on in the counterpoint so that's the
