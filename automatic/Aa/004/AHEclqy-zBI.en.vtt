00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.460
 so the next slab is not called spikelet 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.360
 it can be done and how from the tail with 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.680
 Republic and just with loose 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.269
 hair at the very bottom here here 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.999
 but we will consider options 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.869
 it is from the tail for this we need 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.329
 decide how to tail exactly in half 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.300
 into two big strands 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.800
 on the right side of them just before the game 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.579
 the edge itself will dial the extreme right strand 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.359
 make me stand out 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.850
 and attached 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.600
 poland left half 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.900
 on top of 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 we also make the courage of the country 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.290
 of them right half 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.740
 so marat kabirov every time 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.910
 the most extreme hide and seek 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.110
 and affiliated 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.450
 the opposite half 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.690
 top and it folds very beautiful 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.760
 weaving 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 still differently called fish tail 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.390
 it turns on the longer than usual 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 spit 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.410
 but it looks 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.410
 very beautiful 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.780
 you can take bribes and pao more but 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.479
 smaller hide and seek looks more 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.510
 spectacularly 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.510
 Spit turns volumetric 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 see it what all the same fail 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.629
 also choose the trend yourself 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.229
 you like more 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.029
 it may be quite a small mistake myself 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.699
 maybe the most 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.699
 but over the entire length of hair 3 per cassano 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.849
 you yourself become this and not because 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.509
 that the prince of weaving I think you already understand 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.329
 see how it turns out
