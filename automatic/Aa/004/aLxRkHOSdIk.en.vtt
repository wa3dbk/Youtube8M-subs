00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 six thousand eight hundred years before the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.180
 first war the high elves led 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 for giving it sea they left lime indoor back and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220
 they challenged the teacher's storms their 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 fleets navigated the wide world by 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.099
 many years and discovered mysterious 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.929
 lost kingdoms throughout your trip 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 give it to the sea ​​who had taken the name 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 from his stryder who walks by day 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.410
 he sought places of great power over 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 which build your new home 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.450
 town his fleet finally came to the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.329
 beaches of a continent that later 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 it would be called lord iron disembarking 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 the high elves founded a settlement 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 in the calm clearings of tears file 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.739
 after a few years many of them 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230
 the people began to go crazy 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 high elven priests theorized that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.790
 something evil slept in this part 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 particular of the world 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.860
 the rumors could never be Roman 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 the high elves raised their camp 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.340
 and they moved north where 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.110
 there was another area rich in energy 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 as the high elves crossed the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.240
 Rich mountain lands of Lord Byron 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.820
 his trip became increasingly difficult 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.040
 since it cuts its relationship with 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.870
 energies of the well of eternity 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.800
 many of them fell because of the cold 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.810
 climate or died of diseases the most 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.850
 puzzling change however it was the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.820
 fact that they were no longer immortal or 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.979
 immune to the elements became more 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 small of what they were and their skin was 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 turned white losing the color purple 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.780
 characteristic of his race and his hair 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.240
 He turned blond like the sun to 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.460
 complicate their jobs they found 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.250
 incredible creatures that had never 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
 seen in indoor lime they also found 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.899
 a primitive tribe of humans that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.600
 hunted in the ancient forests without 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.550
 But the biggest challenge was dealing with 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.360
 the voracious and cunning trolls of his the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.670
 hand 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.490
 these trolls had formed a great king 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.680
 the empire to manny and they had the ability 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.050
 to regenerate your skin and limbs before 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.300
 the most terrible injuries but they tried 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.950
 be a barbaric and evil race and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.870
 they proved hostile to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.660
 foreigners who transferred their 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 borders the elves developed a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
 deep animosity for the vicious 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.100
 trolls and killed them wherever they 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.140
 they found for centuries the empire they love and 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.269
 he fought other troll kingdoms that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.849
 had settled on the continents of the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.390
 south the urbas and the jungle of strat le 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.459
 thorne 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 but the arrival of the high elves was 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.350
 considered an insult to their 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 ancestors and their gods after many 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.910
 years the high elves finally 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.980
 they found a land that was part 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.530
 remnant of the ancient continent of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.350
 heat in the depths of the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 the continent's forests founded the kingdom 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.910
 of Kate wings and they set out to create a 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
 mighty empire that will exceed that of their 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.920
 cousins singers unfortunately the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.989
 city ​​was founded on the remains of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.819
 an ancient settlement that the trolls 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.980
 they considered sacred 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.989
 almost immediately the trolleys 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.230
 they started attacking the settlements 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.749
 elves en masse the elves decided not to 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.760
 abandon their new land they used their 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:25.430
 magic to fight the savages 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.409
 trolls under the leadership of patri marc 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.510
 were able to defeat the 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.450
 warrior bands of love and that the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.180
 They exceeded 10 to 1 some elves 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.280
 however remembering the previous ones 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.439
 preventions of the singers feared 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 that the use of magic could call the 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.750
 attention of the defeated legion of fire 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.760
 therefore they decided to defend their 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.379
 lands with a protective barrier that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.469
 would allow them to realize their 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.359
 enchantments built a series of 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.730
 Monolithic runes at various points 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.519
 around that the logging that will mark 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.189
 the borders of the magical barrier the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.049
 runes not only masked the magic 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.150
 elfa to be detected by other 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.699
 dimensions but it helped them 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.549
 scare away the superstitious bands of 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.530
 trolls with the passage of time that the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.130
 dallas was transformed into a monument to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.680
 magical progress of the high elves 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.720
 its ancient palaces were forged 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.030
 with the same structural style as 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.190
 old halls in indoor lime but 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.740
 respecting the topography of the earth 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.260
 that the felling began to shine like a 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.930
 jewel that the high elves always dreamed 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.360
 the council of silver wall was founded 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.340
 to rule the power over Kate wings but 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.440
 the dynasty of the suvs triders always 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.110
 would maintain a modest political power 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.060
 over the city made up of seven of 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.790
 the greatest lords of the high 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.890
 elves the council worked to ensure 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.140
 land security the fas and its 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.810
 village surrounded by its barrier 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.090
 protective the high elves forgot the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.310
 warnings from the night elves and 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.950
 they continued using magic in almost 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.170
 all aspects of their lives in the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.540
 center of silver moon on a huge 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.880
 island north of full aman created the 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.680
 well of the sun with remnant water from 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.620
 well of eternity that they had brought 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.080
 from Kaldor for almost four thousand years 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.639
 the high elves lived peacefully 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.280
 within the security of his kingdom 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.189
 However, the conflicting drones were not 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.050
 easy to defeat these were hiding 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.939
 in the depth of the woods and 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.999
 they expected the number of their bands 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:31.189
 will grow until finally a 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.529
 powerful troll army emerged from the 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:36.669
 shady forests and started the siege of 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.669
 the bright crystals
