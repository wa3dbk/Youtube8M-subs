00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.529
 Hello everyone after more than three years 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.209
 working with dozens of companies without 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.830
 practical application of the cast men of 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:10.540
 handball I think the time has come 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.510
 to share with all of you as 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.310
 I work this methodology in day to day 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.020
 to share those concepts those tricks 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.900
 that you only know when you've 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.640
 lived in the first person this series that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.579
 I called customer de belo man step to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.560
 step consists of more than 200 slides with your 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.929
 comments and I think it covers all the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.179
 key points of the process sincerely 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.280
 I hope you find it useful in your 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.230
 projects of this moment I invite you to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
 improve it through my website or networks 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.210
 social and we start at the beginning 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.980
 by the general framework of work and by 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 two of the key concepts that we should 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.990
 understand to understand how it works 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 the chaste month of handball 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.980
 for a long time it has been thought that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 the idea was the origin of every project 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.990
 entrepreneur has long been a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 thought that transforming an idea into a 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.190
 entrepreneur project was simply 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.130
 question of following a path in which 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.810
 we had to go overcoming stages during 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.090
 I've seen entrepreneurs a long time 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.400
 emotionally hooked to your ideas 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.650
 of business 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.300
 for a long time we thought that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.760
 we could design our project 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.770
 enterprising with closed eyes without 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.340
 look out there and with your ears covered 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.649
 without listening to our customers 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.270
 for a long time we wanted that 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.009
 the business plan was the document 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 final with which the entrepreneurs 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.970
 they could open any door 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.770
 but now we know that in the life of a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.280
 entrepreneurial project to go from a point 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.890
 a point b is not worth the straight line 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 Now we know that as we know so much 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.400
 our starting point and that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.500
 We arrive at a site more or less 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630
 close to the one we had planned after 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.590
 have changed several times of course in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.960
 the journey 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.520
 now we know that the path of a 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.829
 entrepreneur project is much more 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.659
 convulse with stages in which we give ourselves 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.609
 realize that we have no idea what 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.740
 our clients want the known ones 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.319
 as the forms of inspiration with 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.030
 Stages of heavy turbulence and hours 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.479
 that follow very growth stages 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.039
 low 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.929
 the one known as my mushroom 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.330
 disenchantment of which very few 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.450
 projects come alive and begin a 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 more or less accelerated takeoff 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 and this is where the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.349
 definition of startup that makes this plan 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.970
 as a temporary organization designed 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.569
 to look for a business model 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.180
 recurrent and scalable 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.370
 and from this definition is born what I 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.200
 I call search mode that is going to be the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 key to understand all concepts 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.030
 that we are going to see in this series of 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.099
 presentations because a company by 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.349
 very small, I 've already found your 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.840
 business model knows who their 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.400
 customers how to get to them how much 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 are willing to pay for their 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.069
 products or services so as 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.840
 that in a startup we are precisely 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.560
 trying to find answers to those and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.450
 other questions and we also know how 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.639
 we have seen before in this search 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.370
 we're going to do it in an environment of 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.709
 extreme uncertainty and in that process 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.569
 of search we are going to apply a new 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.090
 framework focused on the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.549
 people in which people and their 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.189
 circumstances are the reason for being of 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.079
 our entrepreneurial project where are we going 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.239
 to build and tell a story 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.849
 related to the business model and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.250
 our products or services where 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.620
 let's experiment let's build 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.560
 to learn and where collaboration 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.540
 with other startups with other people is 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.990
 a key piece in this process of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 search 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.820
 learning and in the next video 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.710
 let's talk before the sequence 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.340
 correct application of casto mÃ©ndez
