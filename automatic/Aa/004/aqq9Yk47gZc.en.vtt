00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey people to welcome warmly at 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 another video of me in this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.020
 video I want to give you some real 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.589
 to imagine really good games 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.589
 have fun 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.520
 the first game you can imagine 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.890
 That's what it's called when sackboy does that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 whole is such a jump'n'run game and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.099
 The goal of the game is to get as many as possible 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.020
 to collect coins with these coins 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.900
 You can find something here later in the shop 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.310
 buy eg upgrades or something and of course 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.110
 You should always try as far as possible 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.379
 possible to get away from the opponents 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.489
 or destroy them while running 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.590
 if now, for example , this mean 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.059
 Dealer liquid to say pure runs 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 then you see I have stopped him 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 I'm such a monster now I am this 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.309
 but here by wiping forward 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 just escaped but if you have a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.920
 Time is too slow then you will 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 also from this monster, so to speak 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 we took that to the magnet 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.430
 still get here now all 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 coins automatically attracted by 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 This magnet brings again 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.550
 Neat coins but I think it has 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.110
 also a very nice game you fun 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 It can be great for traveling or something 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.289
 The bus's predecessor train ride will be very 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 play nice 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.410
 It was not boring now 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.690
 but it still really does 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.180
 fun to play this game here 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.880
 the next game is called crossroad 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.679
 is free to load in the app store and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.690
 The aim of the game is this tool 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.229
 as far as possible unscathed over the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.060
 roads and rails and rivers too 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.280
 to carry the whole one makes easy 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 by tapping the display if you like 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.950
 the chicken comes to the left 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.390
 to the left or to the right 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.789
 accordingly, of course, after 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 right one can not wait here forever 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.789
 but if I just go 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 I do not do anything then I have too 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.780
 already lost and I will be here from 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 This eagle is caught, so to speak 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.690
 really a really cool game and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.119
 Definitely fun with us here 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.849
 To be always means to improve, so to speak 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 and I'm really happy it's very much 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.330
 kept simple but it does on everyone 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.179
 a lot of fun 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.770
 the next game is called what cars 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.500
 is also free 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.119
 and here it is, so to speak, a ranch b 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 and you see, there are also here 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.179
 very many levels 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.860
 the control is actually very 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.599
 easy and you just wipe here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.250
 behind the car, so to speak to the left 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.349
 or right and then the car drives 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.630
 either left or right 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.890
 further down I get the more 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.900
 faster for the car if you are here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.110
 above by slow which underwear 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 then the coins move up faster 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.900
 the street 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.460
 they can be collected and used with 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.620
 This one can then here in the shop yet 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.270
 more pick up the level 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.800
 actually very different 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 Sometimes you have to face it here 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.140
 drive a certain time or against 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.020
 other opponents definitely makes fun 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.140
 this game after two times later 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.940
 is boring but makes 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.100
 just in the long run even fun this 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.989
 play here to play the next game 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.239
 is called stick who is actually a 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.010
 very simple gameplay but me 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.720
 still think it's very brilliant 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.670
 and you have different ones here 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.690
 platforms and you just have to go to the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.900
 touch display 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.180
 there is now a transition so to speak to 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.739
 created next platform on 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.900
 The platform is then always such a 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.940
 Red dot, so to speak, the middle of the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.410
 platform if you caught this very 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 then even get extra time 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.489
 I also like this game a lot 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.470
 nice of the gameplay now have to 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.030
 for example, just the middle of the platform 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 has reached extra points again 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.980
 Now look again if we 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.450
 No, that was a bit too short 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.519
 but I really like the game a lot 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.799
 nice game will be in between for 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.720
 the for the train ride or boredom 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.049
 the games are really really good 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000
 the last game is called gateways 22 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.700
 and I had many smaller ones now 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.200
 games, there is still a map where you have 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.329
 Selecting the games can go easy 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.989
 have a look here and we had to go to 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.380
 example, the device tend to this figure 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.610
 now keep in balance 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.570
 we have done that now, there is yes 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.100
 also again points 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 There are really many here 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.810
 small games and so many 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.190
 games, there is also there will 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.019
 not boring at all 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.739
 so a very big one, so to say 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.380
 selection 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.049
 there is now you have to be here before this 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.090
 Whole fish swim away to land 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.440
 get 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.750
 and yes I think the game hockey too 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.430
 in the long run a lot of fun that just not 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.220
 it gets boring that fast you have to 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.320
 dodge the mines then down here 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.250
 to get to the treasure 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250
 these magnets here 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.210
 You can get this round here 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.770
 By the way, three times that makes it all 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.599
 Just so now we have here 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.940
 this game did not succeed and 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.280
 a total of three here to say 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
 do not make the game then that is 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.949
 Round is really over 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.479
 varied and in addition it 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.460
