right here this is a very very nice
predator<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> always<00:03:28.000> thought<00:03:28.240> when<00:03:28.480> these

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
predator I always thought when these

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.730 
predator I always thought when these
figures<00:03:28.990> were<00:03:29.080> coming<00:03:29.349> out<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.590> all<00:03:29.709> of

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
figures were coming out that all of

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
to be removed but I guess it's just one

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.990 
to be removed but I guess it's just one
of<00:03:33.170> them<00:03:33.319> there's<00:03:34.069> his<00:03:34.250> little<00:03:34.280> blaster<00:03:34.879> right

a<00:06:51.379> figure<00:06:51.949> I<00:06:51.979> recommend<00:06:52.909> the<00:06:53.360> only<00:06:53.509> problem<00:06:53.809> I

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:53.899 
a figure I recommend the only problem I

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:56.229 
a figure I recommend the only problem I
have<00:06:54.110> with<00:06:54.289> these<00:06:54.439> figures<00:06:54.649> I<00:06:54.829> mean<00:06:55.249> I<00:06:55.429> mean<00:06:56.209> I

have with these figures I mean I mean I
know<00:06:56.389> we<00:06:56.599> all<00:06:56.899> know<00:06:57.050> they're<00:06:57.169> gonna<00:06:57.289> be<00:06:57.469> a

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099 
like retooling on the figures but I kind

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.309 
like retooling on the figures but I kind
of<00:07:01.159> wish<00:07:01.279> they<00:07:01.459> would<00:07:01.579> give<00:07:01.759> us<00:07:01.879> new<00:07:02.089> I<00:07:02.360> don't
