term<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> insidious<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.750> each

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
term is insidious is because each

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
term is insidious is because each
athlete<00:00:49.290> will<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.950> different<00:00:50.340> signs<00:00:50.790> and

symptoms presented to you some of them

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060 
symptoms presented to you some of them
will<00:00:54.540> appear<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.079> mild<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:55.980> even

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
will appear to be mild some will even

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
will appear to be mild some will even
try<00:00:56.399> through<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:58.260> concussions<00:00:58.770> are

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
try through it well concussions are

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
try through it well concussions are
dangerous<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.489> we<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.390> athletes

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
dangerous because we know that athletes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.479 
dangerous because we know that athletes
are<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.530> risk<00:01:02.000> after<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.300> initial<00:01:03.539> concussion

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
are at risk after an initial concussion

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
are at risk after an initial concussion
so<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.850> imperative<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.510> they're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
so it's really imperative that they're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.680 
so it's really imperative that they're
fully<00:01:07.950> healed<00:01:08.280> before<00:01:08.580> returning<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> sport

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
fully healed before returning to sport

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.330 
fully healed before returning to sport

a concussion we're concerned that if

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.750 
a concussion we're concerned that if
they<00:01:18.659> did<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.049> report<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.010> social

second concussions by the time you see
them<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.280> might<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> third

might<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.900> severe<00:01:28.350> than<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.770> had

might be more severe than if we had

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.670 
might be more severe than if we had
