in<00:00:26.579> the<00:00:26.669> photograph<00:00:27.149> we<00:00:27.779> might<00:00:28.200> be<00:00:28.290> thinking

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
in the photograph we might be thinking

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:29.839 
in the photograph we might be thinking
if<00:00:28.649> I<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.040> get<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.309> to<00:00:29.399> look<00:00:29.520> like<00:00:29.579> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
if I can just get it to look like the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.200 
if I can just get it to look like the
photograph<00:00:30.439> it'll<00:00:31.439> it'll<00:00:31.710> read<00:00:32.009> well<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:33.059> no

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
photograph it'll it'll read well but no

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.639 
photograph it'll it'll read well but no
it<00:00:33.450> doesn't<00:00:33.690> work<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:33.840> well<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> painting

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it doesn't work very well in a painting

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.510 
it doesn't work very well in a painting
this<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> black<00:00:36.559> bluish<00:00:37.559> color<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this kind of a black bluish color that I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.730 
this kind of a black bluish color that I
call<00:00:38.790> photographic<00:00:39.450> gray<00:00:39.690> does<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.410> for

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
call photographic gray does not work for

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.910 
call photographic gray does not work for
a<00:00:41.010> painting<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:43.170> recommend<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
a painting so I would recommend that you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
a painting so I would recommend that you
get<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.370> values<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.820> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.329> lighter<00:00:45.630> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
get the values a little bit lighter in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
get the values a little bit lighter in
your<00:00:46.020> painting<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:47.520> look<00:00:47.820> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
your painting and then look for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.470 
your painting and then look for
opportunities<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.900> have<00:00:49.320> rich<00:00:50.250> color<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
opportunities to have rich color in your

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
opportunities to have rich color in your
darks<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:54.120> blue<00:00:56.300> but<00:00:57.300> we

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
darks and it could be just a blue but we

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.500 
darks and it could be just a blue but we
can<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> neglect<00:00:59.060> even<00:01:00.060> some<00:01:00.270> red

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
can don't want to neglect even some red

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.219 
can don't want to neglect even some red
colors<00:01:01.550> within<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.760> within<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:03.809> shadows

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
colors within our within our shadows

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.609 
colors within our within our shadows
even<00:01:05.540> though<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.689> don't<00:01:06.869> show<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
even though they don't show up in the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.099 
even though they don't show up in the
photographic<00:01:08.100> reference<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.780> let<00:01:09.960> those

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
photographic reference and you let those

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.379 
photographic reference and you let those
colors<00:01:10.499> just<00:01:10.740> mingle<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.210> give<00:01:12.359> a

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:12.389 
colors just mingle and that will give a

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.450 
colors just mingle and that will give a
sense<00:01:12.749> of<00:01:12.960> light<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.770> painting<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:17.039> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sense of light in your painting and I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.239 
sense of light in your painting and I
might<00:01:17.639> even<00:01:17.789> bring<00:01:17.969> it<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
might even bring it right down into the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:25.789 
might even bring it right down into the
into<00:01:20.249> the<00:01:20.340> reflection<00:01:20.939> here

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.959 

okay<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.659> once<00:01:27.659> again<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
okay so once again that's that's in a

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.969 
okay so once again that's that's in a
video<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:32.189> workshop<00:01:32.969> and<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.600> into

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
video on my my workshop and I go into

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
video on my my workshop and I go into
quite<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.100> extensive<00:01:35.929> explanation<00:01:36.929> of<00:01:37.380> why<00:01:37.649> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
quite an extensive explanation of why we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
quite an extensive explanation of why we
want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.429> color<00:01:38.969> in<00:01:39.060> our<00:01:39.299> shadows<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
want to get the color in our shadows and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080 
want to get the color in our shadows and
then<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.880> kind

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
then how to do that actually it's kind

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.980 
then how to do that actually it's kind
of<00:01:42.119> tied<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> lights<00:01:44.569> if<00:01:45.569> we<00:01:45.719> leave<00:01:45.869> our

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
of tied to the lights if we leave our

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240 
of tied to the lights if we leave our
lights<00:01:46.229> real<00:01:46.439> light<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.039> have<00:01:47.219> our

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
lights real light we can have our

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
lights real light we can have our
mid-tones<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.939> little<00:01:48.119> bit<00:01:48.240> lighter<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> then

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
mid-tones a little bit lighter and then

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.779 
mid-tones a little bit lighter and then
our<00:01:49.530> darks<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.039> be<00:01:50.130> lighter<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.429> we<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.670> get

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
our darks can be lighter and we can get

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.370 
our darks can be lighter and we can get
a<00:01:50.819> little<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.060> color<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> darks<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:57.380> we

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
a little more color in the darks so we

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
a little more color in the darks so we
can<00:01:58.530> come<00:01:58.679> over<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:58.970> listen<00:01:59.970> let's<00:02:00.539> not<00:02:00.599> let

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
can come over here listen let's not let

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.010 
can come over here listen let's not let
neglect<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.729> warm<00:02:03.000> side<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> our<00:02:03.569> palette

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
neglect the the warm side of our palette

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.699 
neglect the the warm side of our palette
too<00:02:05.270> because<00:02:06.270> these<00:02:06.750> photographic<00:02:07.289> Gray's

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
too because these photographic Gray's

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.039 
too because these photographic Gray's
are<00:02:07.920> all<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> same<00:02:08.369> flat<00:02:08.880> grayish<00:02:09.329> color<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
are all the same flat grayish color we

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.890 
are all the same flat grayish color we
tend<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.319> forget<00:02:10.500> red<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.400> being<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.390> dark<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
tend to forget red as being a dark and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690 
tend to forget red as being a dark and
you<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.110> what<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:13.950> even<00:02:14.160> push<00:02:14.370> our

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you know what we can even push our

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.240 
you know what we can even push our
yellow<00:02:15.120> towards<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.019> dark<00:02:16.260> side<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.040> do

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
yellow towards the dark side and we do

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.770 
yellow towards the dark side and we do
that<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.120> raw<00:02:18.420> umber<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.630> some

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that with the raw umber you get some
