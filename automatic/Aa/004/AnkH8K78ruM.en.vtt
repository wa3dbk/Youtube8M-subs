00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
every egg by hand but we found that we

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.739 
every egg by hand but we found that we
get<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.369> little<00:02:04.579> shells<00:02:04.880> here<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.329> there<00:02:05.479> so

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
get a little shells here and there so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.449 
get a little shells here and there so

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
when the volume went up we started

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.889 
when the volume went up we started
buying<00:02:07.609> pre<00:02:07.880> cracked<00:02:08.179> eggs<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.660> they're<00:02:08.780> all

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.520 
buying pre cracked eggs but they're all
fresh<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.920> next<00:02:09.950> step<00:02:10.490> here<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.330> add<00:02:11.750> sugar

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
