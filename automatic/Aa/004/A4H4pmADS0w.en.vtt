hey<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.469> Greg<00:00:01.650> from<00:00:01.680> Orange<00:00:02.040> Street

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey this is Greg from Orange Street

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey this is Greg from Orange Street
samples<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.600> I'm<00:00:03.810> gonna<00:00:03.899> show<00:00:04.170> you

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
samples in this video I'm gonna show you

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.289 
samples in this video I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.500> legato<00:00:04.920> works<00:00:05.250> everything<00:00:06.000> from<00:00:06.180> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
how the legato works everything from the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.110 
how the legato works everything from the
legato<00:00:06.629> articulations<00:00:07.589> such<00:00:08.099> as<00:00:08.309> hammer-ons

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
legato articulations such as hammer-ons

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480 
legato articulations such as hammer-ons
and<00:00:09.330> pull-offs<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> actual<00:00:10.860> slide<00:00:11.190> mode

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
and pull-offs to the actual slide mode

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.900 
and pull-offs to the actual slide mode
so<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.509> I'll<00:00:12.630> start<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> by<00:00:13.259> explaining

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
so first I'll start out by explaining

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
so first I'll start out by explaining
the<00:00:14.910> unique<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.450> about<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.780> library<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the unique thing about this library is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
the unique thing about this library is
that<00:00:17.100> you're<00:00:17.220> able<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.550> play<00:00:17.910> chords<00:00:18.660> like

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
that you're able to play chords like

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.540 
that you're able to play chords like
this<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:21.320> well<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.380> legato<00:00:23.250> lines<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
this as well as legato lines like this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.779 
this as well as legato lines like this
and<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.300> able<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.900> mix<00:00:28.640> both<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and you're actually able to mix both of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
and you're actually able to mix both of
those<00:00:29.880> styles<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.420> playing<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> same<00:00:31.170> time

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
those styles of playing at the same time

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:43.880 
those styles of playing at the same time
like<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.270> way<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> does<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.200> by

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
like this and the way it does that is by

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160 
like this and the way it does that is by
establishing<00:00:44.070> certain<00:00:45.000> rules<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
establishing certain rules that you can

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.250 
establishing certain rules that you can
configure<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:47.219> order<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> determine<00:00:48.510> whether

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
configure in order to determine whether

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.650 
configure in order to determine whether
you<00:00:49.530> mean<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.270> played<00:00:51.510> as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you mean for a line to be played as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.920 
you mean for a line to be played as
legato<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.250> played<00:00:53.550> harmonically<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
legato or to be played harmonically so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860 
legato or to be played harmonically so
the<00:00:55.050> notes<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.379> sound<00:00:55.620> simultaneously<00:00:56.870> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the notes will sound simultaneously so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.349 
the notes will sound simultaneously so
here<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.620> important<00:00:59.100> controls<00:00:59.489> in

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
here are some important controls in

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.119 
here are some important controls in
terms<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.530> performance

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
terms of that so you go into performance

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.030 
terms of that so you go into performance
and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.550> fretting<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:04.110> control<00:01:04.530> right

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and then fretting and this control right

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.710 
and then fretting and this control right
here<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> click<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.119> it'll<00:01:06.360> bring<00:01:06.570> up

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here if you click on it it'll bring up

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.330 
here if you click on it it'll bring up
the<00:01:06.840> extended<00:01:07.439> name<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.170> layer

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
the extended name as well as layer

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.289 
the extended name as well as layer
controls<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.610> course<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.150> other

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
controls of course if you're on other

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
controls of course if you're on other
layers<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.710> different<00:01:14.189> topic<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
layers but that's a different topic for

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.440 
layers but that's a different topic for
a<00:01:14.850> different<00:01:15.180> video<00:01:16.520> basically<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.270> by

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
a different video basically right now by

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
a different video basically right now by
default<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.110> set<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> minor<00:01:20.009> thirds<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.640> any

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
default it's set to minor thirds so any

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.840 
default it's set to minor thirds so any
interval<00:01:21.299> within<00:01:22.170> minor<00:01:22.830> thirds<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.729> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
interval within minor thirds will be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.130 
interval within minor thirds will be
played<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.360> legato<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.049> I'm

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
played as legato like this so if I'm

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.140 
played as legato like this so if I'm
playing<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:29.930> minor<00:01:30.930> second<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:32.150> they'll

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
playing a minor second like this they'll

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.859 
playing a minor second like this they'll
play<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.979> major<00:01:34.979> second<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.549> minor<00:01:35.820> third<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
play a major second or minor third but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.789 
play a major second or minor third but
as<00:01:36.960> soon<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.290> play<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.710> major<00:01:38.460> third<00:01:39.799> it'll

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
as soon as I play a major third it'll

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
as soon as I play a major third it'll
play<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.220> distinct<00:01:41.579> notes<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
play them as distinct notes now you can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
play them as distinct notes now you can
adjust<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.960> too<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.430> turn<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
adjust that too or you can turn it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
adjust that too or you can turn it
completely<00:01:44.970> off<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.229> when<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.799> range<00:01:47.009> setting

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
completely off so when the range setting

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.499 
completely off so when the range setting
is<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.640> off<00:01:48.470> every<00:01:49.470> note<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.829> played

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
is at off every note will be played

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.880 
is at off every note will be played
harmonically<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.780> this

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.280 

and<00:01:59.030> of<00:02:00.030> course<00:02:00.270> using<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.690> layer<00:02:00.870> controls

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and of course using the layer controls

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.660 
and of course using the layer controls
you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:01.860> switch<00:02:02.250> back<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.490> forth

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you can actually switch back and forth

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.620 
you can actually switch back and forth
between<00:02:02.880> different<00:02:03.690> range<00:02:04.520> values<00:02:05.630> using

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
between different range values using

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.930 
between different range values using
whatever<00:02:07.170> condition<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:08.040> be<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.460> a<00:02:08.670> key

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
whatever condition you want be it a key

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
whatever condition you want be it a key
switch<00:02:09.240> controller<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.800> even<00:02:11.070> just<00:02:11.250> something

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
switch controller or even just something

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.930 
switch controller or even just something
like<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.030> velocity<00:02:13.020> range<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.850> other

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
like a velocity range the other

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.790 
like a velocity range the other
important<00:02:15.540> control<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.050> right<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.680> this

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
important control is right here this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980 
important control is right here this
legato<00:02:17.220> setting<00:02:17.760> these<00:02:18.270> different<00:02:18.630> legato

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
legato setting these different legato

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.040 
legato setting these different legato
modes<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.740> strict<00:02:20.100> means<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:21.360> it's<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.990> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
modes so strict means that it's going to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930 
modes so strict means that it's going to
strictly<00:02:22.380> approach<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.040> from<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.490> keyboard

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
strictly approach it from a keyboard

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.590 
strictly approach it from a keyboard
view<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.350> intervals<00:02:25.860> as<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:27.060> happen<00:02:27.510> on

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
view so the intervals as they happen on

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.660 
view so the intervals as they happen on
the<00:02:27.750> keyboard<00:02:28.080> are<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> are<00:02:28.680> interpreted<00:02:29.520> as

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the keyboard are is are interpreted as

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
the keyboard are is are interpreted as
legato<00:02:30.440> compared<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.710> string<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.450> more

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
legato compared to string which is more

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.250 
legato compared to string which is more
accurate<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:36.030> terms<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.450> guitar<00:02:36.750> technique

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
accurate in terms of guitar technique

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.020 
accurate in terms of guitar technique
but<00:02:37.770> it's<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.950> little<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.220> confusing<00:02:38.730> if

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
but it's a little more confusing if

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.430 
but it's a little more confusing if
you're<00:02:39.300> triggering<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.780> from<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.020> keyboard

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
you're triggering it from a keyboard

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.970 
you're triggering it from a keyboard
that<00:02:41.430> basically<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.540> mode<00:02:42.840> means<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.590> any

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that basically this mode means that any

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
that basically this mode means that any
notes<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.700> occur<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> straight<00:02:45.810> same

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
notes that occur on the straight same

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.730 
notes that occur on the straight same
string<00:02:46.620> will<00:02:47.220> be<00:02:47.370> played<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.880> legato<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> then

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
string will be played as legato and then

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.440 
string will be played as legato and then
finally<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.400> lock<00:02:50.910> mode<00:02:51.120> which<00:02:51.300> is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
finally there is a lock mode which is

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.700 
finally there is a lock mode which is
great<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.810> tapping<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.560> of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
great for tapping like this so and of

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.500 
great for tapping like this so and of
course<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.430> range<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.239> can

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
course like the range you can

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.699 
course like the range you can
dynamically<00:03:00.989> switch<00:03:01.230> between<00:03:01.470> those

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
dynamically switch between those

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.630 
dynamically switch between those
different<00:03:01.890> values<00:03:03.200> okay<00:03:04.200> let's<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
different values okay let's go on to the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.000 
different values okay let's go on to the
slide<00:03:06.030> mode<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:07.140> into<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> controllers

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
slide mode so go into the controllers

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.280 
slide mode so go into the controllers
which<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:09.000> pretty<00:03:09.330> much<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.720> global

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
which is pretty much the global

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.550 
which is pretty much the global
controller<00:03:10.739> view<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.630> right<00:03:13.050> now<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> slide

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
controller view and right now the slide

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.550 
controller view and right now the slide
mode<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.580> controller<00:03:15.239> number<00:03:15.630> 88<00:03:16.140> by

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
mode is on controller number 88 by

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.150 
mode is on controller number 88 by
default<00:03:17.040> which<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.720> alternate<00:03:18.720> pedal<00:03:19.160> but

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
default which is the alternate pedal but

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.100 
default which is the alternate pedal but
I'm<00:03:20.280> gonna<00:03:20.489> quickly<00:03:20.730> MIDI<00:03:21.239> learn<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
I'm gonna quickly MIDI learn that to the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.449 
I'm gonna quickly MIDI learn that to the
sustain<00:03:22.470> pedal<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.100> show<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.310> how<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
sustain pedal so I can show you how it

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.370 
sustain pedal so I can show you how it
works<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.600> I'm<00:03:24.690> gonna<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.020> strum

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
works and then I'm gonna take the strum

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.310 
works and then I'm gonna take the strum
mode<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:26.880> move<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.840> different

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
mode and just move that to a different

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.910 
mode and just move that to a different
controller<00:03:28.620> number<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.239> basically<00:03:30.810> when<00:03:31.770> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
controller number so basically when the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.979 
controller number so basically when the
slide<00:03:32.370> mode<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.790> activated<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
slide mode is activated so when the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.710 
slide mode is activated so when the
sustain<00:03:34.380> pedal<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.800> down<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.400> case<00:03:35.720> all

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
sustain pedal is down in this case all

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.660 
sustain pedal is down in this case all
the<00:03:36.780> legato<00:03:37.470> instead<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.040> being<00:03:38.190> played<00:03:38.459> as

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the legato instead of being played as

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.130 
the legato instead of being played as
hammer<00:03:39.030> ons<00:03:39.270> or<00:03:39.480> pull<00:03:39.720> offs

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
hammer ons or pull offs

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.770 
hammer ons or pull offs
they'll<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.800> played<00:03:41.040> as<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> slide<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
they'll be played as a slide like this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.370 
they'll be played as a slide like this
so<00:03:43.230> here's<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.500> normal<00:03:43.650> legato

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
so here's a normal legato

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.740 
so here's a normal legato
and<00:03:45.470> here's<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.370> slide<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.210> now<00:03:47.300> I'm<00:03:47.420> pressing

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
and here's a slide so now I'm pressing

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.060 
and here's a slide so now I'm pressing
down<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.960> pedal<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.650> speed<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
down the pedal and the speed of the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.550 
down the pedal and the speed of the
slide<00:03:52.310> depends<00:03:52.910> on<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.300> velocity<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:54.020> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
slide depends on the velocity of the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920 
slide depends on the velocity of the
second<00:03:55.280> overlapping<00:03:55.700> note<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.540> can<00:03:56.780> play

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
second overlapping note so I can play

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.900 
second overlapping note so I can play
slow<00:03:57.260> slow<00:03:58.220> slides<00:03:58.520> like<00:03:58.670> this<00:04:00.010> or<00:04:01.010> fast

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
slow slow slides like this or fast

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.850 
slow slow slides like this or fast
slides<00:04:02.210> by<00:04:02.480> pressing<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.050> key<00:04:03.280> more<00:04:04.280> loudly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
slides by pressing the key more loudly

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.700 
slides by pressing the key more loudly
so<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:07.730> all<00:04:07.940> ties<00:04:08.210> in<00:04:08.570> with<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.260> legato

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
so that all ties in with the legato

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.640 
so that all ties in with the legato
settings<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:10.580> you<00:04:11.270> can<00:04:11.420> set<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:12.020> different

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
settings so you can set it to different

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.880 
settings so you can set it to different
legato<00:04:13.370> modes<00:04:13.820> like<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.450> tapping<00:04:14.900> mode<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.380> do

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
legato modes like the tapping mode to do

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.170 
legato modes like the tapping mode to do
very<00:04:16.370> wide<00:04:16.730> slides<00:04:17.290> or<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:19.100> could<00:04:19.280> set<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.520> to

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
very wide slides or you could set it to

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.300 
very wide slides or you could set it to
different<00:04:20.720> ranges<00:04:21.170> so<00:04:21.709> if<00:04:21.770> you<00:04:21.860> only<00:04:22.040> want<00:04:22.280> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
different ranges so if you only want to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.340 
different ranges so if you only want to
be<00:04:22.430> able<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.760> slide<00:04:23.030> between<00:04:23.420> you<00:04:24.050> know<00:04:24.140> let's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
be able to slide between you know let's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.490 
be able to slide between you know let's
say<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.770> minor<00:04:25.280> 3rd<00:04:25.640> or<00:04:25.880> major<00:04:26.210> 3rd<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:27.230> can<00:04:27.380> do

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
say a minor 3rd or major 3rd you can do

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.250 
say a minor 3rd or major 3rd you can do
that<00:04:27.620> as<00:04:27.830> well<00:04:28.180> they<00:04:29.180> all<00:04:29.360> respond<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.170> the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
that as well they all respond to the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.100 
that as well they all respond to the
same<00:04:30.500> controls<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.100> interface<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.390> hopefully

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
same controls in interface so hopefully

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.690 
same controls in interface so hopefully
